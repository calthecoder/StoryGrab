2.0-split-https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/health-care-elections-democrats.html-split-Advertisement Supported by By Trip Gabriel COLUMBIA, Mo. — Senator Claire McCaskill isn’t subtle in reminding voters what her campaign is all about. She’s rechristened it the “Your Health Care, Your Vote” tour. The turnaround could not be more startling. After years of running as far as they could from President Barack Obama’s health care law, Ms. McCaskill and vulnerable Senate Democrats in Florida, West Virginia and other political battlegrounds have increasingly focused their closing argument on a single issue: saving the Affordable Care Act. Now, with Republicans desperate to reposition themselves and come up with their own health care pitch, and with the elections roiled by gale-force winds on immigration and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, the question is whether health care will be enough to save her and Democrats in other key Senate races. Most recently, the mail bombs sent from Florida and the fatal synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh on Saturday have added jagged new pieces with the potential to further disrupt both parties’ strategies. Ms. McCaskill and her Republican opponent, the Missouri attorney general, Josh Hawley, clashed sharply over health care once again at their final debate on Thursday. She lambasted him for participating in a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and would end its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. He said he supported a program that would protect patients with high medical costs outside the current health care law. On the same day, President Trump proposed that Medicare pay for certain prescription drugs based on the prices paid in other industrialized countries — just one initiative coming from the White House and Republicans as they try to fight back against perceptions their policies would undo protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. [Read about the political motivations of people who recently made their first donations to an election campaign.] And on Friday, Mr. Obama, in speeches in Detroit and Milwaukee, mocked Republican ads on health care, accusing them of trying to rewrite history and their own positions after trying for years to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown whether Democrats’ health care message will hold up as Mr. Trump, through almost daily rallies and frequent Twitter blasts, tries to dominate television news and social media in the campaign’s final days. He has said the midterms would be about “Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense.” But after years of trying and failing to rally voters behind the complicated features of President Obama’s health care law, Democrats have discovered this year the emotional power of one of its benefits, protecting people with pre-existing illnesses. The subject has lit up polls, monopolized advertising budgets and driven a national strategy for Democrats, who are defending 10 Senate seats in states President Trump won and are relying heavily on health care as a defining issue in key states including Arizona, Florida, West Virginia and Nevada. “This is the message coming straight from people in the red states,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democrats’ Senate campaign committee. Republicans have been put on the defensive, insisting in TV ads featuring their family members that they, too, support affordable care for people with pre-existing conditions. Their claims come after years of lawsuits and congressional votes by Republicans to gut or weaken the health care law’s protections of expensive chronic illnesses. In addition to fashioning a message on health care, Mr. Hawley, is relying on a blunt appeal to partisanship. Asked about his campaign’s closing message, Mr. Hawley’s campaign manager, Kyle Plotkin, pointed to the slogan boldly emblazoned on the campaign bus: “Stop Schumer. Fire Claire. Don’t let the liberals take over.” Callie Glascock, an administrator at the University of Missouri who voted for Mr. Trump, said on Sunday she would cast a ballot for Ms. McCaskill, who is seeking a third term, because of health care. “Everyone wants to say Obamacare was bad. Well, who’s come up with a better plan?” she asked outside a market displaying a hay wagon of pumpkins in Ashland, Mo. At the same time, her father-in-law, a lifelong Democrat, is leaning toward Mr. Hawley. “He said, You know what, after watching all that Judge Kavanaugh stuff, he’s about changed his mind on voting Democrat,” said his son, Mike Glascock, who was also at the market. “He just hated all that rhetoric.” The midterms “are officially about health care,” in the conclusion of the Wesleyan Media Project, whose analysis of television ads in congressional races found that nearly half include discussion of health care. Two years ago, during the 2016 election, health care was featured in just 10 percent of Democrats’ ads. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation last week found that in two battleground states, Florida and Nevada, nearly seven in 10 voters support protecting people with pre-existing conditions even if it means healthy people would pay more. Democrats’ reversal of fortune on health care astonishes former Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who lost her seat in the last midterm cycle, she believes, because of her vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Before the 2014 campaign season, Ms. Landrieu invited other red-state Democrats up for re-election to her Washington home to brainstorm about reforms they could propose without actually mentioning “Obamacare.” They did not succeed. Not only Ms. Landrieu but other Democrats were swept away that year in Arkansas, Alaska and North Carolina, handing Republicans the Senate majority. “The truth is finally winning out,” Ms. Landrieu said of the Affordable Care Act’s increasing popularity in polls. “It didn’t happen fast enough for us.” National Democrats said the issue bubbled up this year from voters. In fact, the party was taken by surprise last year as Congress was swamped with phone calls and protesters when Republicans tried but failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a series of dramatic votes. Just as the issue was fading a bit from voters’ minds, Republicans in 20 states filed a lawsuit this year to overturn what remains of the law. In June, the Trump administration weighed in. Citing the president’s approval, the Justice Department said it agreed with the need to end the health care law’s guarantees that insurance companies could not deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses or charge them more. “They gave us the political gift of the cycle,” said Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group on the left. Since then, Republicans in many close races have scrambled for cover, insisting that they, too, want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Two Republican House members running for Senate in battleground states, Representatives Martha McSally of Arizona and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, argued they voted for Obamacare repeal-and-replace bills in 2017 that would have protected people with pre-existing conditions. Similarly, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, the most vulnerable Republican seeking re-election, maintained in a debate last week that he helped write a 2017 bill protecting pre-existing conditions. Yet the Republican bills watered down or eliminated the protections in existing law. They would have allowed states to receive waivers to let insurers charge higher premiums for unhealthy people. Nowhere is the issue more important than in the close race in Missouri. Ms. McCaskill, 65, recounts on the campaign trail how, when she was a young lawyer, her parents were forced to move in with her after her father lost his job and his insurance because of a brain tumor. “I remember hearing my mother in the next room being very upset because she was so frightened,” she said at a rally last Friday. Mr. Hawley, as Missouri’s attorney general, is a plaintiff in the multistate lawsuit that would terminate the Affordable Care Act altogether. Facing criticism on the issue, he recorded an ad in which he tells of learning that his 5-year-old son has a chronic disease and says he will force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. In a newspaper column, Mr. Hawley proposed that the federal government pay expenses above $10,000 for people with pre-existing conditions. His plan included no details on how the government would raise the money to cover these costs. Ms. McCaskill blasted it as “a press release plan” in a debate last week. “You can’t go to court and get rid of important protections when there is no backup, when people will be in a free fall,” she said. In an interview on Saturday, after he had walked in the University of Missouri homecoming parade, Mr. Hawley, 38, said that his plan would cost only “a fraction” of the Affordable Care Act. He attacked Ms. McCaskill for being unwilling to consider solutions that are not part of Obamacare. The 2010 law offset expenses for people with existing illnesses by requiring healthy people to buy insurance — a mandate since eliminated by Republicans. For all the Democrats’ focus, it is uncertain how the issue will influence voters. John Kosach, a 32-year-old public relations researcher in a St. Louis suburb, said he supported Ms. McCaskill. “Claire’s message of saying Hawley is going to repeal the law but there isn’t a plan in place, that’s resonated with me,” he said. His wife, Sam Kosach, 31, who also works in public relations, said Mr. Hawley’s use of his family in the ad about his support for pre-existing conditions “just felt icky.” Hey, I’m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. I’ll give you the latest reporting and intel on the midterms and take your questions from the campaign trail.  Another voter, Karen French, a 59-year-old retired nurse, is part of the large bloc of conservatives who crossed party lines in the past to vote for Ms. McCaskill, one of only two Missouri Democrats in statewide office. This year, however, she will not do so. “I’m kind of ashamed of my country and the mess we made of Judge Kavanaugh’s life,” she said. “I probably would have voted for Claire until that happened.” Ms. French, who lives in rural Fulton, Mo., has a 28-year-old daughter who has severe problems with her heart and lungs. Asked if she was worried that Mr. Hawley’s lawsuit would threaten protections for people like her daughter, Ms. French broke in before a reporter could finish the question. “It doesn’t matter to me,” she said. “More important is the situation that happened with Judge Kavanaugh.”    Advertisement

As a result, a growing number of reproductive rights activists say it is time American women learn the facts about "self-managing abortion" with pills. Kate could tell something was wrong. She'd been feeling nauseous for days and her body just felt different. The 27-year-old massage school student and her boyfriend were supposed to leave on a short road trip together, but before they hit the highway, she asked him to drive to a local drugstore. Kate, which is not her real name, bought a pregnancy test and took it in the store bathroom. It was positive. "I probably lost all my colour," she recalls. "I was pretty devastated." Over the six-hour drive that followed, the young couple wrestled with the decision in front of them - to become parents or not. Kate was open to the idea, but as a full-time student doing odd jobs on the side to make ends meet, she was also broke. Her boyfriend told her he wasn't ready to become a father. "I struggle putting food on the table and I'm in debt," she says. "I just didn't see how I could justify putting a kid in that situation." The nearest abortion clinic was hours away, and the attendant who answered the phone told her that because she was less than 10 weeks along, she could terminate the pregnancy with pills - one dose of the drug mifepristone to take at the clinic, and a second medication, misoprostol, to take at home. She was also told it would cost nearly $800. Kate was shocked. "It would have taken everything I have. I don't know how I would have paid rent." So she did what thousands of women around the globe do every year - she decided to try to have an abortion on her own. Despite the fact that abortion is legal in the US, various studies have estimated that hundreds of thousands of Americans have tried to end a pregnancy without the help of a doctor at some point in their lives, whether through medication, herbs, vitamin C, alcohol, drugs or self-harm. Although accurate figures are difficult to come by, one study estimated that in the state of Texas alone, between 100,000 and 240,000 people had attempted a self-induced abortion. A New York Times analysis of Google data found that in 2015, there were 700,000 searches from the US for information about self-managed abortion - phrases like "how to have a miscarriage," "how to self-abort" and "buy abortion pills online". With the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court, pro-choice activists are preparing for the possible dismantling of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision which legalised abortion across the country. In this imagined "post-Roe" United States, some campaigners are making the case that women need to know the facts about how to "self-manage" their own abortions. "This is the next frontier in abortion access," says Erin Matson, co-founder of Reproaction, a pro-choice group that has begun hosting public information sessions on self-managed abortion throughout the US. "Everybody has a right to know information about how to safely and effectively end a pregnancy on their own. It's bigger than this political moment." Anti-abortion activists say that even if Roe is overturned, it is unlikely abortion would become illegal across the US, and that it's a dangerous argument for women managing their own care. "All overturning Roe v Wade would do is give the question back to the states and allow the states to legislate the procedure," says Dr Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist in San Antonio, Texas, and a board member of the American Association of Pro-Life OB-GYNs. "I think that even if restrictions were put in place so that more women could not access the procedure, that many more women would carry their pregnancies to term and probably many of these women would find that what began as an unintended pregnancy would become a desired pregnancy and a desired child." Though the phrase "self-managed abortion" conjures images of coat hangers and disreputable, back-alley abortionists, campaigners say that is not the world we live in anymore, in large part thanks to the development of abortion with pills, which can be used with about 95% effectiveness until 10 weeks into a pregnancy. "A third of all abortions now, you go to the clinic and get pills and go home and do the abortion," says Dr Beverly Winikoff, founder and president of Gynuity Health Project. "Doing an abortion now means swallowing a pill." Such was the case for Kate, who quickly found online pharmacies who could ship her mifepristone and misoprostol from India for half the cost. However, she didn't like the look of the websites or trust that the medication would be genuine. That's when she came across a new site called Aid Access, which quietly came online earlier this spring. The reproductive rights advocates behind websites like Women Help Women, Safe2Choose and Women on Web have been sending abortion pills by mail to countries where abortion is illegal or severely restricted for over a decade. One study found that of 1,000 Irish women who received pills by mail using the Women on Web service, 95% ended their pregnancies successfully. But until very recently, none of these services would ship to the US - a wealthy, first-world country where abortion is legal, and the anti-abortion movement is politically powerful and litigious. That changed this spring, when Dr Rebecca Gomperts, the Dutch physician behind Women on Web, founded Aid Access. She publicly announced its existence earlier this month, though she estimates she's already sent 600 mifepristone-misoprostol kits to the US since April. Dr Gomperts says that after reading email pleas for help from all over the US and watching how many restrictions states have placed on abortion services over the last 10 years, she decided something had to be done. "It is especially the really poor women who are affected by obstacles that have been put in place in the last years," she says. "The need is growing and it's super desperate." When Kate got to Aid Access, she filled out a short survey that asked about the length of her pregnancy, her medical history and her reasons for needing help. She was approved, paid a $95 fee (women too poor to pay can still receive the medication) and gave Aid Access her address. Dr Gomperts wrote Kate the prescription from her private practice in Europe. After the little brown box arrived in the mail (from a pharmacy in India that Dr Gomperts declines to name), Kate took the medication as instructed, and says that after a sleepless night of painful cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, she began to bleed. By morning, it was over. "I felt a real sense of relief two days later," she says. "I'd been so miserable for what seemed like forever." Aid Access is just the newest way American women can get their hands directly on medication without going through a doctor. Online pharmacies - many located in India - will sell the drugs without a prescription (one research group bought 22 such products online and received 20, and although some of the blister packs were damaged, 72% contained enough of the drug to be effective). Misoprostol - which is less effective than mifepristone but can be used on its own to induce a miscarriage - is sold over the counter in Mexico and has been found for sale at US flea markets near the border. Some activists believe that with accurate information about how to take the medication and when to seek help, abortions can easily be done at home. "We can trust women to make decisions and to manage their own abortions," says Dr Gomperts. "Women have a human right to health." Obtaining abortion drugs in the US without a prescription is against the law. The US Food and Drug Administration has placed mifepristone under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which is a special restriction on distribution for medications that may have serious risks associated with their use. The opioid fentanyl is also under a REMS, for example. Mifepristone can only be distributed in a doctor's office or hospital. In a statement to the BBC, the FDA said it is looking into Aid Access: "The agency takes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the US through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of US law." However, many doctors believe that the REMS on mifepristone is unnecessary, and both the American Medical Association, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that the restriction be lifted. "To date, 19 deaths have been reported to the FDA among the more than three million women in the United States who have used [mifepristone]," one working group of doctors wrote in 2017 in the New England Journal of Medicine. "Pregnancy-related death... is 14 times higher." Anti-abortion organisations, like the Family Research Council, argue that the medication is not safe enough to be provided over the counter, and that circumventing FDA regulations is even riskier. Women who have an ectopic pregnancy, who have an intrauterine device or who have a history of adrenal health problems are not advised to take mifepristone. Rare complications include sepsis or haemorrhage, which could be life threatening. "Just sort of violating the law and the distribution requirements - there are reasons these things are in place," says Chris Gacek, a senior fellow on regulatory affairs at the Family Research Council. "Regardless of your views on abortion, I just don't think this is good medicine." There are other, legal attempts to remove obstacles between patients and medication. Planned Parenthood currently runs telemedicine programmes in 14 states, where a doctor consults with the patient online or via telephone at a clinic that is convenient for her, and if the doctor determines she is eligible for medication abortion, he or she unlocks a drawer containing the pills remotely. Researchers at Gynuity Health Projects are currently running a study that's been filed with the FDA, in which women are directly mailed the drugs after consultation with a physician. However, 19 other states have a ban on abortion drugs being dispensed by telemedicine, and since the medications are not obtainable without a prescription in the US, any pregnant person trying to obtain the pills without a doctor's help is operating in risky legal territory. "I would never encourage anyone to do that," says Tara Kepler, an attorney of counsel at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner and a telemedicine legal expert. "There's no way to get it without a prescription unless you're violating the law." At the same time, Kepler says that she's never heard of legal action being taken against a patient for ordering a prescription online. Activists say that since women will continue trying to self-induce abortion regardless of the legal risks, it is their responsibility to put out helpful, accurate information. "What we know is people were managing their abortions before Roe, and have and will continue to do so without Roe," says Pamela Merritt, co-founder of Reproaction. On a balmy Sunday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, a small group gathered in the brightly lit basement of an old union hall in St Louis, Missouri. A handwritten sign hung on the door read, "Self-Managed Abortion Forum". Attendance was modest - 10 men and women in total - and the bags of crisps and fruit salad sat untouched. Organisers wondered if the event might inspire protest, but none materialised. Nevertheless, the sense of urgency in the room was palpable. Several people declined to provide their names, and said that they intentionally did not RSVP to the event on Facebook. "It could be traced back if [abortion] gets criminalised," said one. "I'm a pharmacist," another said. "That could be bad for me." "I'm clergy," added a third. Next to the fruit salad was a stack of fact-sheets which laid out how a regimen of 12 tablets of misoprostol taken four at a time over the course of nine hours can induce an abortion. "Misoprostol is typically used within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and is about 85 percent effective," the card read, next to a cartoon of a woman with four pills under her tongue. Pamela Merritt, one of three panellists at the front of the room, said that to her knowledge, hers is the only group actively promoting information on self-managed abortion. Her co-director Erin Matson acknowledged merely hosting the discussion is "radical". Still, they believe the need for these conversations is clear. "The Supreme Court has solidified a 5-4 conservative majority for the foreseeable future," said Merritt. "We now must proceed in a way that protects access to care and protects people who are most vulnerable to reproductive oppression." Still, the activists have to be careful. Reproaction's panellists never explain how to obtain the pills. Instead, they refer the audience to links online with more information. "It's actually not that complex, how to use these pills to end a pregnancy. What's complex is how to talk about it in a way that doesn't expose people to legal liability," says Matson. "We are not providing advice. We are not coaching people who are self-managing their abortions through the process. We are sharing the World Health Organization's protocol." According to the WHO, "where mifepristone is unavailable" misoprostol - the second drug prescribed for a medication abortion - is the "recommended method of medical abortion". The drug was developed for the treatment of stomach ulcers, but researchers soon discovered it also causes miscarriage. Misoprostol is cheaper and less highly regulated than mifepristone, and there are no tests that would detect it in the blood stream. It is less effective than taking misoprostol together with mifepristone, but in absence of other options, World Health Organization reports say that the regimen is safe and effective at ending pregnancy. In St Louis, one of the panellists was Dr Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist who - until just the week prior - provided abortion services at clinics in Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri. Newly enforced state regulations revoked her admitting privileges, meaning she can only do abortions at a single clinic located in St Louis. Missouri now joins the ranks of one-clinic states like North Dakota, West Virginia and Kentucky. "If we get to a place where there are states or large portions of the country where there is no access to abortion, I think self-managed abortion will fill at least part of that gap whether we like it or not," says Dr McNicholas. "I have both a clinical and moral obligation to help women do the safest thing that they can to achieve the outcome they want. Whether I'm able to actually provide the care is irrelevant." The number of clinics in the Midwest has dropped 22% over the last five years, and the state of Texas alone has shuttered 32 clinics. Thirty-three states have passed laws to limit or restrict patient access to abortion over the past decade. For instance, in Missouri, women must wait 72 hours after their initial doctor visit to get the abortion, a significant obstacle for those who are driving long distances, and may have jobs and need childcare. Merritt says that in places like Missouri, women are already living in the equivalent of a post-Roe world. "For a lot of people abortion access is a right in name only - particularly for people experiencing financial difficulties," she says. At the St Louis discussion, audience members asked questions about legal exposure, and what someone ought to do if she took misoprostol but then needed to go to a hospital with complications. "They should say they're pregnant and bleeding," said Dr McNicholas. "That's all the information that needs to be given." Self-inducing an abortion with pills carries legal risk. Although no one has ever been prosecuted directly for purchasing abortion drugs online, the act of buying pills has been used as evidence for criminal charges, including murder. The most famous case was Purvi Patel, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison under Indiana's feticide law before her conviction was overturned. Similar cases have played out in Idaho, Virginia and Georgia. In some of these cases, it was a doctor or hospital employee where the woman sought help who contacted police. Dr Skop, the anti-abortion obstetrician-gynecologist in San Antonio, says that if a woman does not tell her doctor that she has tried to self-induce an abortion with misoprostol, she puts her doctor at a disadvantage in her treatment. She adds that she would never turn a woman over to authorities if she found out she'd tried to end her own pregnancy. "I would care for her. I think that most OBGYNs would," she says. At the end of the session in St Louis, some swapped stories about how they were preparing for the end of Roe. Two said they'd been stockpiling doses of Plan B, the so-called "morning after pill", just in case that medication were also discontinued or even criminalised. "We have to protect each other," said one woman. "The system is not going to save us." The day after Kate took her pills, her morning sickness was gone and she was able to eat normally for the first time in weeks. The day after that, she was back at work. She says she is no longer pregnant, and confident that she made the right decision. "I'm grateful that I was able to access the medication because I think it's better than the alternative," she says. "I didn't understand why it was that expensive, not to mention the drive both ways, and missing work for me. I wouldn't have done it another way." At the same time, she stresses that her experience was difficult. Her first shipment of medication got stuck in somewhere in customs and she had to send frantic emails requesting another shipment, which she got free of charge. The delay was extremely stressful and although she knows this is not everyone's experience with the medication, she found the process very physically painful. "I don't want it to seem like it was easy, because really, it's not," she says. "It was pretty traumatic, the whole thing." Otto, another person who used Aid Access, says the package arrived without incident and that though there were intense, painful cramps and vomiting, the experience was positive one. As someone who identifies as gender-fluid and finds doctor visits of any kind uncomfortable, Otto was relieved to do the procedure at home with supportive roommates, instead of hours away, alone in a hotel room. "I was, kind of, I don't know - really proud of myself for how far I'd come in my understanding of my own body and the politics of my own body," Otto says. "I was just excited." Kate also says she has no regrets, and the fact that she might be breaking the law didn't scare her or impact her decision to seek out the medication on her own. She's nearly finished with school, and is eager to start a career in massage working specifically with cancer patients. She hopes that by speaking out about her experience, other women in similar situations will do whatever they feel is best for them. "If you end up having to take things in your own hands, it is your body, it's your life," she says. "I think everybody should have that right."

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we. We're taking another look at our software and practices to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.

3.0-split-https://www.wired.com/story/iran-facebook-trolls-using-russia-playbook/-split-On Friday, Facebook shut down another network of 82 accounts, pages, and groups that have been posing as US and UK citizens since 2016. The network, which Facebook says originated in Iran, has spread memes, articles, and other posts about political topics including race relations, the upcoming midterm election in the US, and the recent confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It also hosted seven events. What distinguishes this latest group, which Facebooks says it discovered a week ago, from the Iranian propaganda network that tech giants shut down this past summer are the striking similarities between its campaign and the one the Russians mounted before the 2016 election. Rather than focusing on the Iranian regime's agenda at home, the new network focused squarely on American and British politics. As it turns out, that may be a more successful strategy: While the network discovered this summer had just around 200,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram, this latest batch had more than one million. "This content appeared consistent with what we’ve seen in other major operations," Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said on a call with reporters Friday. "It was targeting broad division. It was sowing discord and targeting socially divisive issues." In August, Facebook, Twitter, and Google suspended an expansive web of phony social media accounts and websites linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, a state-owned news network. Those pages and accounts, which were first spotted by the cybersecurity firm FireEye, posed as ordinary citizens as well as journalists and news organizations that advocated for policies explicitly favoring Iran. This latest batch took a different tack. While there was some anti-Saudi and anti-Israeli content sprinkled throughout, the accounts and pages mostly pretended to be American liberals, and they posted divisive content about American politics, according to the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensics Research Lab, which is working with Facebook to dissect the operation. Unlike this summer's batch, Facebook says it has no indication yet that the most recent network is linked to the Iranian government. "This looks like an Iranian operation which learned from earlier Russian ones," says Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the DFRLab. According to DFRLab director Graham Brookie, his team had less than 24 hours notice to piece through the content. They published some preliminary findings shortly after Facebook's announcement. The most staggering difference between the two Iranian campaigns is how much engagement the most recent one received on Facebook and Instagram. According to DFRLab, one page, titled "I Need Justice Now," amassed more than 13 million video views on Facebook. Another, titled "No Racism No War," received more than 10 million views. DFRLab's researchers note, however, that some of the engagement on these posts appears to have been artificially amplified because it so far exceeds the number of followers the accounts had. Gleicher says Facebook did find links between this network and the one it had shut down in August. He says Facebook researchers manually combed the accounts for signs of inauthentic coordinated activity. Despite those links, however, it seems the accounts taken down Friday were far more recent. Their earliest post was in June 2016, but Gleicher says “the majority of the activity is over the last year.” The Iranian pages homed in on national news events in the US like the Kavanaugh hearings. One cartoon posted to the page "No Racism No War" showed Kavanaugh griping about his life being “destroyed by unproven allegations without a trial.” Behind him, Trayvon Martin, sitting with other victims of police brutality, says, “That’s rough, bro.” The pages also shared articles from mainstream news sources. In September, the "I Need Justice" page shared a Daily Beast article with the headline “Stormy Daniels: Trump’s Penis Looks like Toad from Mario Kart.” Like the Russian pages, this set shared highly divisive content that primarily skewed negative. "Zionism is terrorism," read one post on the Instagram account @know_the_realities. But there were a few odd exceptions. DFRLab released a slew of posts from the "No Racism No War" page that just encouraged Americans to vote. This is not the first parallel researchers have found between the Iranian and Russian operations. In August, Jonathan Albright, director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, discovered another unusual link: On a page called "Music Extension," which promotes a Chrome extension connected to Russia's Internet Research Agency, Facebook's Related Pages section recommended "The British Left," one of the phony Iranian pages taken down this summer. The "Music Extension" page was still live on Friday. "There are either network-based connections or advertising-based connections that somehow link those pages," Albright says. "It wouldn't randomly suggest a British propaganda page on a music page. They have nothing in common." Albright took a screenshot of the related page recommendation and shared it on Twitter in August. Since then, Facebook has not answered WIRED's repeated requests for comment on why that referral might have occurred. But the company says it has not found any connections between the Iranian and Russian accounts. Whether that recommendation is an algorithmic quirk or some sign of a deeper link between the Russian and Iranian campaigns is unclear. Given the diplomatic ties between the two nations and the mounting signs that they're following the same playbook, knowing the answer to that question seems more critical than ever. Former Chief of Disguise for the CIA, Jonna Mendez, explains how disguises are used in the CIA, and what aspects to the deception make for an effective disguise.

4.0-split-http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/grassley-refers-avenatti-his-kavanaugh-accuser-client-for-criminal-investigation-split-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has referred attorney Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick to the Justice Department for criminal investigation related to accusations they made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is referring attorney Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick to the Justice Department for criminal investigation related to their accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process. Swetnick was among the women who came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Specifically, she said she observed Kavanaugh and his friends drinking to excess at parties in high school and lining up outside bedrooms to gang rape females. Grassley sent a letter Thursday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the FBI Director Christopher Wray asking they investigate Avenatti and Swetnik for three potential criminal violations: conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress. In the 12-page letter, Grassley outlines the allegations Avenatti and Swetnik made and times in which there were contradictions in their story that led him to question the truth of their statements. He included 17 pages worth of attachments to back up his concerns. Grassley said in a statement that he appreciates when “well-meaning” citizens come forward with information relevant to the committee’s work and takes allegations of sexual misconduct seriously. ICYMI: Massive, Loud and Passionate Anti-Kavanaugh Protest Takes Over Hart Building “But in the heat of partisan moments, some do try to knowingly mislead the committee,” he said. “That’s unfair to my colleagues, the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth. It stifles our ability to work on legitimate lines of inquiry. It also wastes time and resources for destructive reasons.” Grassley said that he doesn’t make a referral of this nature lightly but he can’t brush aside potential violations of the law. “Ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future,” he said. Avenatti said in a tweet that he welcomes the investigation because it can shed light on “Kavanaugh’s lies and conduct.” It is ironic that Senator Grassley now is interested in investigations. He didn’t care when it came to putting a man on the SCOTUS for life. We welcome the investigation as now we can finally get to the bottom of Judge Kavanaugh’s lies and conduct.

5.0-split-http://www.rollcall.com-split-White House Black Leadership Event Turns Into Mini-Trump Rally FBI: Mail Bombs Were ‘Not Hoax Devices’ Latest News Harris Staffer Tyrone Gayle Dies After Cancer Battle Trump Confirms Arrest in Package Bomb Case as Targets Mount McSally Bills Herself as ‘Firewall’ Against Democratic Takeover of Senate What’s That Sound? The Monster in the Budget Politics The Last of the Gingrich Revolutionaries It was nearly 24 years ago that Republicans swept into power in stunning fashion, ending 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. But those 73 new Republicans who came to the House and 11 who came to the Senate on the 1994 wave engineered by Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America” have now dwindled down to a handful, and after this election only seven will likely be left in Congress. For his part, Gingrich, a supporter of President Donald Trump, doesn’t see this as the end of an era, but a continuation of a revolution that began in 1964, with presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator. “I think we were the natural evolution that went Goldwater, Reagan, ’94 Contract, Trump,” he said. “I think there’s a very natural evolution of those things.” Two members of the Class of 1994 are retiring this year: New Jersey Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. In January, the two likely remaining continuously serving GOP House members will be Reps. Mac Thornberry of Texas and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the latter of whom has said the 2018 election will be his last. Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, another 1994 alum, lost in 2008, but won back his seat two years later in a rematch. Thornberry and Jones are both in races rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Chabot, however, faces a competitive re-election against Democrat Aftab Pureval in the 1st District, which Inside Elections rates Leans Republican. Three current Republican senators started their careers in the House in 1995: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma has served continuously in the Senate since 1995. Of the four, Wicker is the only one up for re-election this year, bidding for a second full Senate term. Inside Elections rates his race against Democrat David Baria, the state House minority leader, Solid Republican. Burr won a third Senate term two years ago after announcing it would be his last. Back in 2014, Gingrich lamented what had become of his caucus. At a reunion of the Class of 1994, he said, “The fact that we do not have positive themes and positive issues is going to cost us seats this fall.” As it turned out, Republicans picked up 13 seats in the House that year and retook control of the Senate.

Politics For Trump, Pipe Bombs Sent to Opponents Is Ploy to Halt GOP ‘Momentum’ Before Midterms For President Donald Trump, the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats this week appear to only be about spoiling a Republican Party on cruise control. That was the president’s message on Friday, when he said media outlets are covering a string of mail bombs sent to leading Democrats and CNN to distract voters from an election cycle he believes favor Republicans. “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,” he said in a tweet. By putting the word “bomb” in quotation marks, the president appeared to question whether the devices, which federal experts say were not capable of exploding, meet the definition of a bomb. As Election Day has neared, the forecast for the midterms has tightened, with Democrats still favored to win a majority in the House, with the number of projected pickups fluctuating and a Senate dynamic continuing to show multiple GOP routes to holding the majority in that chamber. The Trump midterm campaign message has focused largely on firing up his base to drive up conservative voter turnout in key states and districts with competitive House and Senate races. He used the attempted bombings to continue that strategy. “Very unfortunate, what is going on,” he said of the bomb drama and nationwide manhunt. “Republicans, go out and vote!” Packages, all mailed in manila envelopes with Forever stamps, were sent to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, actor Robert DeNiro, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Rep. Maxine Waters of California. CNN’s New York offices were evacuated Tuesday when that outlet got a mail bomb addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan. The count jumped again on Friday, with suspicious packages addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. All have been sharply criticized by the president. But his top aides reject that he has any responsibility and say his often bleak and derisive rhetoric has nothing to do with the violent background developing.

When the Red Sox pushed across their first run in the first inning Monday night, a Fox announcer burbled that Boston also scored in the first inning of the opening game when they won the Series in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Of course, no players from 2004 and 2007 are on the active Red Sox roster — and scoring in the second or fifth inning can also be an effective way of winning a ballgame. Highlighted on the screen every night are the postseason stats of the players, even though the Dodgers, for example, played just 11 games to advance to the World Series. Virtually invisible during the telecasts are what the players accomplished during the full 162-game season, even though these numbers have infinitely more predictive value. Those of us who closely follow politics can easily feel superior to the statistical naïfs in the World Series broadcast booth. But often we fall into a similar trap — the arrogant belief that the future is knowable if you crunch enough numbers. The 2018 midterms have brought a new level of sophistication to political analysis. The New York Times in conjunction with Siena College has completed more than 60 congressional polls with the real-time results flashed on the computer screen with each call. Polling analysts like Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight have honed their predictive models. And traditional race-by-race handicappers like Nathan Gonzales, Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball do an exemplary job on the granular level. Yet, even after hearing cautionary words about polling and polling analysis, we tend to overreact to every statistical gyration. A Rutgers-Eagleton Senate poll from New Jersey, released Wednesday, shows scandal-scarred Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez up by just 5 points in a state that Hillary Clinton carried by 14 points. Is the race tightening? Could Democrats blow a seemingly safe seat? Or is the poll just a margin-of-error quirk? Multiply this reaction by nearly 500 contested races for Congress and governor, and you have a rough sense of the stress levels on both sides less than 300 hours before the polls open on Election Day. The truth is that all the polling in the world cannot prepare you for a midterm election with this broad a terrain. And there are many hard-fought House races, like in Maine’s 2nd District, where there have only been a handful of reputable polls. Sure, broad questions like the generic ballot (“Do you prefer a Congress controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans?”) can offer national clues. But is the Democrats’ current 8-point average edge on this question enough to comfortably overcome the GOP-leaning effects of incumbency and gerrymandering in the House? A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll of 69 hotly contested House districts found the two parties effectively tied. But is this good news for the Republicans because they are holding their own in battleground races? Or is this a formula for a Democratic sweep since more than 90 percent of the districts surveyed are currently GOP held? Knotty questions like these can make political pundits sound like medieval theologians debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. At a certain level there are no hard truths about the 2018 elections yet — only personal tendencies towards optimism or pessimism. After enduring Election Night 2016, many Democrats are like battered children brooding that once again victory (this time, winning the House) will be snatched from their grasp. Similarly, there are Republicans who believe that Donald Trump will help them defy the polls, while other GOP strategists privately worry that a president with no impulse control is leading them to political doom. For all the twitchiness of the political class, it is also worth remembering that the prevalence of early voting in many states cuts into the ability of a single late-breaking event to reshape the midterms. Already, in early-voting states, we are approaching the point when it is too late to effectively drop opposition research. Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States Sometimes politics is simply perverse. This is not a reference to the Trump triumph in 2016, but rather to an earlier midterm election that should serve as a cautionary tale for all those eager to make glib predictions. In 1986, the Democrats won seven Senate seats by a collective margin of 98,000 votes. Those 98,000 votes were the difference between a 55-45 Democratic Senate and one that was controlled by the GOP. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill said triumphantly after the election, “If there was a Reagan revolution, it’s over.” In the 1960s, an ad campaign for Schlitz, a century-old Milwaukee beer, featured the tagline, “You only go around once in life — go for all the gusto you can.” In elections, as well, you only go around once. So it doesn’t matter that in some alternate universe Hillary Clinton is president and the Republicans held the Senate for Ronald Reagan in 1986. Whatever happens on Nov. 6 will seem foreordained by the gods, but in truth, it will be just one of dozens of equally plausible outcomes. What four decades covering politics has taught me more than anything is humility. Neither I nor anyone practicing punditry on cable TV has the gift of prophesy. But, if I had to guess, I would say that the election comes down to how voters sort out the three dominant fundamentals: A booming economy, albeit with a suddenly shaky stock market. A president who violates every rule of decency with his incessant fearmongering and vicious attacks. And a Democratic Party able to aggressively compete across a broad swatch of GOP-held House districts while grappling with a Senate map wildly tilted toward the Republicans. Beyond that, I will be a traitor to the pundit class as I dispense with glib predictions. Instead, I will bow toward the unknowable as I breathlessly wait until the returns come in on Election Night.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Kyrsten Sinema is trying to do something that no Arizona Democrat has done in 30 years: win a Senate election. “We know we can win this election,” the three-term congresswoman told supporters packed into a union hall here Sunday. “This year, the votes in the Senate matter.” And unlike Democrats in other red or purple states from Texas to Georgia who are running on decidedly progressive platforms, she’s making her case as a moderate with appeal to independents and pragmatic Republicans as she takes on GOP Rep. Martha McSally. If Democrats have any hope of taking back the Senate or mitigating potential losses in red states, they need to win Arizona. But to do that, Sinema will also need to turn out the party faithful in high numbers. It’s a delicate balancing act that few Democrats have been able to accomplish in Arizona in recent years — it’s been a decade since the party last won a statewide race. “Midterms are hard [for Democrats] to win in Arizona, which tells you why Sinema is such a phenomenon, that she’s even keeping it close,” Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said in an interview at a Phoenix coffee shop. Democrats believe the state is trending in their direction, but it’s not clear if Sinema’s strategy will be enough to win this year. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. Recent polls have shown Sinema’s once small, but steady, lead nearly evaporate, with McSally even inching ahead in some surveys. And a loss could have Democrats rethinking how they win a state like Arizona. Also Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange Sinema does have a math problem. Republicans and those not registered with a party still outnumber registered Democrats in the Grand Canyon State. That partisan divide makes some Democrats nervous. Karen Lieneke, a 65-year-old English as a second language teacher in Tucson, said she was “cautiously optimistic” that Sinema could actually win. “The climate of fear and the climate of really raw politics is a wild card to me,” Lieneke said at the union hall. Sinema, a former state legislator, has been helped by an aggressive ad campaign touting herself as a moderate and an independent lawmaker. She was on television as early as April, and went largely unchallenged on the airwaves as McSally battled two others in a competitive GOP primary. Democrats say Arizonans recognize that the once self-described “most liberal legislator in the state” has shifted to the center since first coming to Congress in 2012. In a recent radio interview, Sinema said it was difficult to call herself a proud Democrat, opting instead to call herself a “proud Arizonan.” She has acknowledged her ideological shift — an analysis by CQ Vote Watch found she supported the president’s priorities 60 percent of the time, the third-highest score among House Democrats. “Over the years I am proud to say I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally change my opinion,” she said at a recent debate. But Republicans are trying to paint Sinema as a radical liberal, and highlighting past footage of her knocking the Grand Canyon State. “You guys haven’t reported on Sinema calling our state crazy and saying we’re the meth lab for democracy,” McSally chided reporters after touring a technical school in Avondale on Wednesday. “Every single day something is coming out related to her campaign that’s actually legit, her showing disdain for our state.” The National Republican Senatorial Committee in a recent television ad used video of Sinema implying in 2011 that Arizona produces “crazy,” but the tactic might not work with everyone. Dorothy Byrne, a 77-year-old Phoenix resident not registered with any party, is backing Sinema this year (and all Democrats to protest what she sees as a divisive GOP-controlled government). “Tell us what you want to do today,” Byrne said Monday while waiting to hear Democrat Hiral Tipirneni address a town hall meeting in Arizona’s 8th District. “I don’t care what you did 20 years ago. I didn’t do the same things 20 years ago.” Byrne supported GOP Sen. John McCain in 2016, but wasn’t inclined to support McSally this year. “We need things back a little more in balance,” she said. Democrats see a path to victory with the support of nonpartisan voters like Byrne and moderate Republican women. But Sinema also has to make sure that moderate image doesn’t turn off loyal party members, whom she also needs to turn out in large numbers. Arizona may not yet be a blue state, but it isn’t as red as it used to be. President Donald Trump won it by 4 points in 2016, smaller than his margin in the traditional swing state of Ohio. Democrats supporting Sinema packed two union halls Sunday as she traveled from Tucson to Phoenix to stress the importance of voting early. Not everyone in the room was thrilled with her moderate positions, but they still showed up. “I agree with the president essentially never,” Emily Dacey, 31, said at the Phoenix event, adding that she wished Sinema would be more adamantly opposed to Trump. “But I’m not getting to choose my ideal person,” Dacey said. “I’m getting to choose between Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally. And I’m here to fight for her because she still stands more with me than McSally does.” Democrats are touting an extensive field operation as evidence of energy on the left. The joint effort between the Arizona Democratic Party and Sinema’s campaign boasts 25 field offices and 4,000 volunteers across the state. Over the weekend, volunteers knocked on 65,000 doors, the most ever in one weekend, according to Sinema’s campaign. Gallego said there was a focus on getting out the vote this year and that turning out Latino and Native American voters were key to a Democratic victory. But so far, early ballot returns give Republicans an edge. As of Wednesday evening, 44 percent of the early ballot returns were from Republicans, while 33 percent were from Democrats. Gallego, who is weighing a Senate run of his own in 2020, said future efforts may have to concentrate more on turning out the Democratic base. He said an emphasis on voter registration could close the gap as the state shifts demographically with its growing cities. “Arizona’s changing. It just is,” said DJ Quinlan, the former executive director of the state Democratic Party. “The notion that Arizona is this bright red state is no longer accurate. It’s going to be a swing state from this point forward” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Opinion One Person, One Vote. Is It That Complicated? OPINION — I admit that voting is and has always been a celebratory ritual for me, even if the candidate is running unopposed, the office is state agriculture commissioner or my district’s makeup means my one vote won’t make much of a difference. I watched three older siblings march for civil rights, and I am well aware that many brave folks died protecting my right to cast that ballot. While a little rain or a busy schedule might provide an excuse to “sit this one out,” it’s never enough to outweigh the legacy left by a Medgar Evers, who served his country in World War II and was murdered in front of his Mississippi home for, among other civil rights activity, leading voter registration drives in the country he protected. Mine is not a controversial stand — in fact, it’s patriotic. You would think our country’s leaders, without regard to party or politics, would be on my side. You would be wrong. When Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 wrote the majority opinion gutting key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — those that compelled certain states to “preclear” any changes in their voting rules — he insisted that so much had changed in the country that those rules were no longer needed. “The Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Racism is dead, or on its last legs, he seemed to declare. I would not call Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent cynical. It was realistic. As she wrote: “As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abundantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as attempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that originally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.” What Year Is It? Trump’s Midterm Rallies Are Mostly About His 2020 Re-Election Bid In a perfect country, politicians would rejoice at the chance to win the hearts and minds of constituents with strong policies, to show how inclusive their party’s big tent could be. But we are not living in Oz, no matter how much the judges who joined Roberts in the majority decision might have wished. As Ginsburg predicted, the poll taxes, literary tests and lynchings may have disappeared. But the intent remained in full force. The 2013 Shelby County v. Holder ruling was a green light for the shenanigans the federal government once prevented states from pulling. Moving of polling places. Strict ID restrictions targeting minorities, the poor, the elderly and the young. Same-day registrations that made voting easier for those working two and three job. Purges of voting lists. The list was limited only by the imaginations of those making it. And boy, did the folks who wanted to choose their voters, instead of letting their voters choose them, have great imaginations. These new tactics are in bold view in the midterm elections of 2018, with states still mired in lawsuits over restrictions legislators have justified as a fight against that boogeyman, voter fraud, which every study has proved insignificant. In North Dakota, the votes of the original Americans, Native Americans, have been disproportionately jeopardized by a ruling that says a street address rather than a post office box on registrations is required in that sparsely populated state. In North Carolina, a voter ID bill that has been thrown out by the courts for targeting minority voters with “almost surgical precision” may yet rise from the dead if an amendment to the state’s constitution passes. Georgia is in a category all by itself. Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, has refused to recuse himself from his day job of secretary of state, which puts him in charge of overseeing elections, including his own. Cozy, wouldn’t you say? Even GOP secretary of state and Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, the king of efforts to suppress the vote to fight hordes of supposed illegal voters, has passed his election duties over to a deputy. Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first African-American woman elected governor in this country. What some see as evidence of how far America has come, others see as reason for a second civil war, this time on voting rights. Georgia election officials have been accused of tossing out a disproportionate number of absentee ballots from minority voters, and holding up close to 53,000 voter registrations because they do not satisfy a controversial “exact match” requirement with all other government documents. (An errant hyphen or period might be the culprit.) A county official kicked black senior citizens off a bus that was heading to the polls, as if those senior citizens had not already heard enough government officials tell them “no.” What side is the president on? “All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING,” Trump tweeted. “Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!” Not exactly an invitation — more like a warning and a threat. It’s no surprise from a president who insisted the 3 million votes that gave Hillary Clinton a popular vote win in 2016 were the result of illegal voters and fraud. His administration’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, with Kobach front and center, charged with tracking down those voters, I suspect was disbanded for lack of evidence and because state election officials turned their bipartisan backs on requests for intrusive voting records. The integrity and the results of the elections coming up in two weeks could be called into question because of the fruits of that Supreme Court decision. The country is facing the prospect of having an election with results that few trust, to be decided at a later date. All these conflicts will have repercussions long after the midterms — resentments and accusations and an America more divided than ever, sowing more distrust in institutions, this time not law enforcement or the media, but democracy itself. I wish, for his family and our country’s sake, that Medgar Evers were alive, though his spirit and resolve live on in the work of many. There is still so much work to do. Mary C.

Politics The Coincidence of Bomb Recipients, Trump and Far-Right Rhetoric ANALYSIS | The recipients of explosive devices sent this week have so far shared a commonality: harsh criticism by President Donald Trump and far-right followers. But White House officials were in no mood Wednesday to entertain the notion that the president’s descriptions of Democrats as “evil” and news organizations as the “enemy of the people” might have helped lead a bomber to build devices and mail them to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and CNN. A building in Miami that houses an office for former Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also evacuated Wednesday. Trump’s aides declined to comment beyond a statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning what she called “attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures.” “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” Sanders said. Vice President Mike Pence later tweeted his condemnation of the attempted bombings; Trump tweeted this agreement. I agree wholeheartedly! https://t.co/ndzu0A30vU  [Suspicious Package Cases Grow, Debbie Wasserman Schultz First Known Congressional Target] But the matter has one glaring common denominator: Trump’s sharp rhetoric about each recipient and a highly partisan midterm election that has only deepened a widely divided country’s tribal wounds. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” chanted a rally crowd Monday night in Houston, where Trump was firing up the base as he and Sen. Ted Cruz tried to keep the senator’s seat in Republican hands. Trump pivoted from one topic to the next in the manner that defines his raucous stream-of-consciousness rallies, heading straight toward a line sure to ignite the Toyota Center crowd: “If you want the fake news to finally investigate Hillary Clinton, we’ll just have…” That’s when the familiar chant broke out. “Man,” an impressed Trump said before trying to pass off any responsibility: “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.” But if the president was concerned his constant calls for his former political foe to face a federal investigation, it certainly didn’t stop him. “So if you want them to investigate, we’ll just have to nominate Hillary Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. How do you like that?” he said as the crowd booed loudly. “Right? Let’s see how she does. If [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh had to go through what he went through ... can you imagine Hillary up there? That would take three to four years of questions.” His supporters laughed in unison. Trump used the line about Clinton to move into his ramped-up rhetoric about all Democrats, saying the midterms are all about preventing “the radical Democrat mob” from taking “a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country and our economy.” Monday night’s rally alone featured multiple sharp attacks on Democrats as the president eagerly accuses the opposition party of being the “party of crime” that wants to allow undocumented migrants pour over the U.S.-Mexico border to flood the country with crime and drugs while raising taxes and ending programs like Social Security and Medicaid. He blasted Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke for voting for what he called “Obama amnesty.” Trump told the crowd in Houston that Immigration and Border Control officers are fighting “a war” against undocumented individuals — and he essentially told them to blame Obama. “They go in and they take them and they throw them into the paddy wagon, then get them the hell out of our country. We’ve removed thousands, thousands of them. They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people,” he said. “And the towns are liberated. ... I’m telling you, it’s like a war.” Watching a single “Make America Great Again” rally shows how the president’s supporters direct their ire at his political foes, especially Clinton and CNN. A mere mention of the “fake news media” elicited an unprompted chant in Houston: “CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!” “I don’t like them either, OK?” Trump said. Trump is slated to lead rallies Wednesday night in Wisconsin, Friday night in North Carolina and Saturday in Illinois. White House officials gave no indication that he is considering canceling one or all in an attempt to cool down the country’s white-hot political climate. Sanders did not respond to an email asking whether Trump is concerned his words might have played a role in the bomber’s mindset, and if he might cancel one or all of those rallies. Wasserman-Schultz has been a target of Trump’s rhetoric for several years, with her stint at the DNC putting her on his radar. As the 2016 general election was about to heat up, Trump fired off this tweet: “The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she’s out!” [Trump’s Tax Cut Gambit Gets Heads Scratching] Then there’s Soros. Trump on Oct. 5 lashed out at Soros in a tweet, blaming him for financing left-wing protesters who lined Capitol Hill hallways and Washington streets objecting to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!” the president tweeted, adding this hashtag: “#Troublemakers.” The president has also floated the idea, without evidence, that Democrats are financing a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico and heading for the U.S. border. “It was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,” Pence said Monday in the Oval Office before being interrupted by his boss. “And the Democrats, maybe? And the Democrats?” Trump asked with a chuckle. “Well,” Pence started to say before he was cut off. CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked Trump for proof of the Democrat’s involvement. “You know what? You’re going to find out, and we’re going to see,” he said, again offering no evidence. The list of targets grew as did the glare of their shared commonality. Sanders responded with a second statement around midday Wednesday, this time via Twitter. “Our condemnation of these dispicable [sic] acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of explosive devices mailed to the news network and several prominent Democratic politicians and donors. “These cowardly acts are unacceptable and wont be tolerated.” This is an ongoing situation that President Trump and his admin are monitoring closely.

Martha McSally continues to face criticism for her vote to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act, and engaged in a heated exchange with a local reporter over protections for people with pre-existing conditions after an event Wednesday. “I have fought for pre-existing conditions. I voted to protect pre-existing conditions. This is personal,” the Arizona Republican told reporters after touring the Universal Technical Institute. Brahm Resnik of the Phoenix NBC affiliate interjected, noting the GOP measure to repeal the 2010 health care law would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange “It’s not true. It’s not true. Stop parroting Democratic talking points,” McSally said. “Health care is a complex issue. Right now it’s not working. Right now people with pre-existing conditions can’t get access to health care on the health insurance market or the individual insurance market because Obamacare has failed.” The GOP bill, known as the American Health Care Act, included a provision that prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. However, it also provided states an avenue to waive certain regulations, which could have allowed insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for coverage, potentially rendering health care unaffordable. McSally voted for the GOP bill, and reportedly told her Republican colleagues the day of the vote to get this “f---ing thing” done. McSally’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has made health care central to her campaign. The two lawmakers are competing in an open seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Sinema accused McSally in a tweet Wednesday of lying about her record in response to a new McSally television ad where she said she has worked to force insurance companies to protect people with pre-existing conditions. “Here’s the truth: I voted to protect coverage for the 2.8 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions,” Sinema tweeted. “Martha voted to take it away.” Inside Elections with Nathan L.

Politics NARAL Launches Final Push to Fire Up Abortion Rights Voters With voters already casting ballots in states that allow early voting, outside advocacy groups are not just trying to reach potential new voters — they’re working to make sure their most ardent supporters actually show up. That is certainly the case with NARAL, which is announcing a final push to make sure that the abortion rights group’s supporters get out to vote in 2018. The organization is launching a new $750,000 campaign that will feature direct mail and digital advertising geared toward supporters in 17 key races as the campaign cycle nears its end. According to a listing provided to Roll Call ahead of formal release, the mailers are being directed to Senate contests in Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada and Wisconsin. According to a summary of the plan for the final weeks, which was provided first to Roll Call, the House races involved include key seats in Arizona, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. NARAL is also targeting the governor’s races in Iowa, New Mexico and Nevada. NARAL is trying to make sure that the group’s core supporters, many of whom were recently even more engaged over the Senate confirmation process of Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, actually make it to the polls (either through early voting where it’s possible or on Election Day). “Based on the energy we are seeing from voters across the country, we’re supercharging our program to move voters to elect pro-choice champions.The stakes have never been higher,” said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue. “The threat to Roe v. Wade is real and on the horizon.” “Women are fired up and ready to elect candidates in their communities who support us and our families. Our job is to reach as many of them as possible in the next two weeks,” Hogue said. In addition to a national umbrella digital ad, the group’s produced several for individual candidates, including Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The direct mail and new round of digital ads in many of the same jurisdictions are beyond $5 million in midterm-related spending already, including a previously announced $1 million for TV and digital ads and $750,000 for an earlier campaign effort.

Politics GOP Ads Target Young Female Voters on Violence Against Women Act An outside group dedicated to electing Republican women is launching digital ads urging three lawmakers to support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire in December. The digital ads, obtained first by Roll Call, target Reps. Mimi Walters of California and Barbara Comstock of Virginia — both facing tough re-elections — and Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, who’s running for Senate. All three are being challenged by Democratic women. In a year that’s seen high enthusiasm among female voters for Democratic candidates, especially in suburban districts, these issue ads try to highlight GOP lawmakers’ advocacy for women. Republicans are at risk of seeing the number of women in their House conference decline next year. Running on Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Hulu, the ads are targeted to younger women, softer Republican voters and independents, and are backed by a six-figure digital buy across the three states. The ads are part of the MyRoar campaign, which is paid for by Winning for Women. The group’s PAC has endorsed all three women, who are also identified as “Lionesses” on the MyRoar website. One version of the ad begins by explaining the Violence Against Women Act. “What if there was a law that provided defense for victims of sexual assault?” the narrator asks. “Well that law expires in just months,” the narrator continues. “But what if I told you you could help the efforts of women like Congresswoman Barbara Comstock to keep it alive when Congress returns?” “What if I told you that you could be heard?” the narrator says, as the face of a young woman appears on screen. Another version of the ad opens with statistics about rape and sexual assault and the percentage of the offenders who see jail time. Things would be “a lot worse” without the Violence Against Women Act, the narrator says. “Congresswoman Mimi Walters has been working hard for women. Learn how to help Mimi keep working to pass a bigger, better Violence Against Women Act when Congress returns,” the narrator says. The Violence Against Women Act was supposed to expire on Sept. 30, but it was extended under a stopgap spending bill in September. Led by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats have introduced legislation to reauthorize the law with updates, including a provision that would prohibit those under protective order from possessing firearms. No Republicans have signed on to the Democratic proposal. Flashback: Democrats Hope to Extend Violence Against Women Act GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and John J. Faso of New York and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced their own six-month reauthorization legislation in September. Walters is listed as a co-sponsor on that measure. Comstock and McSally are not. Forty-six Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last month asking for urgent action to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act before its Sept. 30 expiration. Comstock and Walters signed on to that letter. McSally did not. “In Congress, all three of these women have a strong track record of supporting legislation that promotes and empowers women. Each is a warrior. And we look forward to their continued commitment to the Violence Against Women Act and to victims of violence and sexual assault across the country,” Winning For Women Executive Director Rebecca Schuller said in a statement.

Meanwhile, in Non-Pipe Bomb Political Midterm News … Politics Gallego Weighs 2020 Senate Run, Confident About Primary Prospects PHOENIX — Rep. Ruben Gallego is focused on helping Democrats win in Arizona in 2018, but he’s also weighing a Senate run of his own in two years time. And he’s confident he would win a Democratic primary. The Arizona Democrat has previously said he is considering a run for the 2020 special election for the last two years of the late Republican Sen. John McCain’s term. Former GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed to McCain’s seat, but he has said he plans to step down at the end of the year. “At the end of the day, I think we’re going to make a determination based on: Can we win? And can we make a difference for Arizona?” Gallego said in an interview here at a local coffee shop Tuesday morning. “And that’s it. I’m not really worried about a primary.” The two-term congressman from the 7th District was confident he could defeat Grant Woods, McCain’s former chief of staff and onetime state attorney general. Woods has said he is considering switching parties to run as a Democrat or independent. “Grant Woods cannot win a Democratic primary in Arizona. So he can make his own determination, and I will just make my own in my own time,” Gallego said. “And we’ll go to a race, and I’ll defeat him and that will be that.” “He was [co-]chairman of Gov. [Jan] Brewer’s re-election campaign after SB 1070,” the congressman added, referring to the state’s controversial 2010 immigration law. “That’s not going to fly with Democrats” Watch: Fiery Arizona Debate in 4 Minutes Gallego said his decision will also hinge on whether Democrats win back the House in November, citing the possibility that he could become the next chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He also said he had to consider how to balance a Senate run with caring for his young son. Another factor in his decision to run? The outcome of this year’s competitive Senate race that features two House colleagues — Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally — for retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. “It’s difficult winning statewide here. And luckily you have a great example in how Sinema is being competitive about it,” Gallego said. “I would probably have to look strongly about [it]. There’s no guarantee that I would win.” Gallego, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, was first elected in 2014, winning a competitive Democratic primary for his Phoenix-area seat. He has been among the Democrats critical of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan for leader two years ago. Pelosi has opened the door to a short-term speakership should Democrats win back the House. Asked if that would be acceptable to anti-Pelosi Democrats, Gallego said, “I think she needs to first focus on making sure the Democrats win before she starts coming up with her platform and how she wants to transfer her power because she doesn’t have the power of speakership right now.” Any discussions about who could lead the House Democrats in the next Congress should wait until after the election, according to Gallego. “Anything before that is totally inappropriate, on her part or anybody else’s part,” he said.

Citing a dementia diagnosis that would most likely progress to Alzheimer’s disease, the 88-year-old said she was “no longer able to participate in public life,” something that defined her career. In making her announcement, O’Connor reminded the nation that the high court, on which she served from 1981 to 2006, was bookended by public service as not only a judge but as an accomplished state legislator and as a senior judge and elder stateswoman on political engagement through her founding of the group iCivics. “Not long after I retired from the Supreme Court twelve years ago, I made a commitment to myself, my family, and my country that I would use whatever years I had left to advance civic learning and engagement. I feel so strongly about the topic because I’ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government, and participate actively in their communities,” she wrote in the letter announcing her decision on Tuesday. The confirmation fight of the newest justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a bitter partisan fight that partially centered on whether, given his background in the George W. Bush White House and his work for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, he could be an impartial jurist given his history in politics. But O’Connor showed that a political career need not necessarily taint a jurist’s. In 1969, she was appointed to an Arizona state Senate seat, then won election to it outright in 1970. She went on to become majority leader, another first for a woman in the Legislature, before opting to run for election to a local judgeship. That set her along the path that would lead to President Ronald Reagan making her the first woman on the high court. After her retirement from Supreme Court, she continued to hear cases as many retired justices do, in the federal court system, all the while starting iCivics and taking care of her husband John Jay O’Connor III, who died in 2009 of Alzheimer’s disease. Chief Justice John Roberts had that civic legacy in mind in his response to the news. “I was saddened to learn that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, like many Americans, faces the challenge of dementia. But I was not at all surprised that she used the occasion of sharing that fact to think of our country first, and to urge an increased commitment to civics education, a cause to which she devoted so much of her time and indomitable energy,” Roberts wrote in a statement released by the Supreme Court. It is fitting that O’Connor’s announcement comes the same day the legacy institution of another Arizona icon, the late Sen. John McCain, announced an initiative to encourage civic participation, voting and respect for human rights. The McCain Institute’s “Mavericks Needed” campaign will run an ad through Election Day and then start a second campaign to last through 2020. “Now more than ever, America needs a new generation of Mavericks to stand up, speak out, serve causes greater than themselves, get in the area and vote on November 6th,” McCain’s widow Cindy, said in a statement. Cindy McCain was elected chairwoman of the McCain Institute last week. The two Arizonans, both of whom came to Washington in the early 1980s, leave the stage but with instructions on what to do in their absences.

Policy Rob Portman’s Report on Trump Trade Policy to Feature Mixed Results A key Republican senator sees positive signs in the Trump administration’s trade discussions with Canada and Mexico, but he still has plenty of criticism for the White House, too. In a major trade policy speech at the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday morning, Sen. Rob Portman is planning to focus on the effects of the Trump trade agenda on the auto industry, a key business in his manufacturing-heavy home state of Ohio. “I’m still reviewing the details of the updated NAFTA agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but I am encouraged by what I’ve seen so far,” Portman, a former U.S. trade representative, is expected to say. “One of the most substantial changes to NAFTA is the rules of origin for automobiles. In the time since NAFTA was ratified 24 years ago, the United States has lost about 350,000 auto jobs, while Mexico gained 430,000.” Portman’s indications of support of that framework is in contrast with his view of what the Commerce Department has done with using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose tariffs, even on close allies, using a nebulous “national security” justification. In his remarks, Portman is expected to speak to the proposal, which has been stalled in the Senate, to rework the trade law to restrict it to true national security implications. “The administration has used Section 232 to impose a new 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports worldwide,” the Ohio senator is expected to say. “For certain countries and certain products, I believe there is a national security issue with steel — including electrical steel, which is critical to the grid. But broadly imposing tariffs on our allies risks them retaliating by putting tariffs on our products.” “Simply put, auto and auto part imports are not a national security threat, and as I’ve been saying for months, these tariffs are a bad idea,” reads a copy of Portman’s prepared speech, which was obtained by Roll Call. Portman will outline views more favorable to Trump and the harder line of his administration when it comes to trade with China, citing Chinese policies such as requirements for joint ventures for U.S. automakers to do business in the communist country. The speech is expected to include a degree of support for the tariff announcements as part of negotiations with China. “While I do have concerns about some of the collateral damage these tariffs can do to folks trying to make products in America, I think this assertiveness on China is needed,” Portman is scheduled to say. “Republican and Democrat administrations alike have tried to get China’s attention on the trade issue and failed. China has been violating and circumventing our trade laws for decades. I think the Trump administration now has China’s attention, and I applaud the president for taking a tough stand.” But Portman is also expected to say that he does not view shortcuts like the purchase of additional soybeans from American producers by China as a solution to the trade issues between the two countries. “Instead, the United States should push for structural changes to the Chinese economy to reduce the ways Beijing distorts the economy in its favor and tilts the playing field away from American workers,” Portman is scheduled to tell the Heritage audience.

5.0-split-https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/battleground-house-districts-remain-close-in-new-poll/2018/10/22/e6c77a32-d63e-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html?utm_term=.11cdb96b36eb-split-The contest for control of the House remains close and hard fought, according to a new Washington Post-Schar School poll of the most-contested districts in the country, with Democrats holding a statistically insignificant lead over Republicans. The latest survey shows only a marginal change in the race during October, with 50 percent currently supporting the Democratic candidate in their district and 47 percent backing the Republican. Candidates from the two parties collectively are running almost even in 48 contested congressional districts won by President Trump in 2016, while Democrats hold the advantage in 21 competitive districts won by Hillary Clinton. The Democrats’ lead in those Clinton districts has narrowed a bit since the beginning of the month. The overwhelming majority of the districts surveyed — 63 of the 69 — are currently represented by a Republican in the House. Collectively these battleground districts voted strongly for Republicans in the 2016 election. The fact that the margins today are where they are illustrates the degree to which the GOP majority is at risk but also the fact that many individual races are likely to be close. Democrats need to gain a net of 23 seats to take control of the chamber. [Read the full poll results ] Overall, likely voters in these districts give the two major parties mixed-to-negative marks. Democrats are rated favorably by 48 percent and unfavorably by 52 percent. For Republicans, it’s 47 percent positive and 53 percent negative. Most voters have a favorable view of one party and a negative view of the other party, but 10 percent say they dislike both parties. Voters in that group say they prefer the Democratic candidates in their districts by 15 points. Four years ago, when the GOP made gains in the midterms, voters who rated both parties negatively at this point in the election said they preferred Republican candidates for the House by 17 points. The battle over the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has energized voters on both sides, according to the poll. About 6 in 10 likely voters in each party say they are more motivated to vote on Nov. 6 as a result of the clash, which included allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh that drove fierce denials from him and other Republicans. Among independents with no partisan leanings, about half say it has motivated them to vote. [How the poll was conducted ] The Kavanaugh hearings split the country, with many Americans saying they believed Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when both were in high school in the Washington suburbs, and many others saying they believed Kavanaugh’s denials that he was innocent of the charge. The new survey finds that a majority of battleground district voters (57 percent) say they are concerned that men they are close to might be unfairly accused of sexual assault. But a far larger majority (78 percent) say they are concerned that women in this country are not believed when they report that they were sexually assaulted. Overall, by 59 percent to 41 percent, Americans say the bigger problem is that women who report that they were sexually assaulted are not believed. On a related question, a 54 percent majority of likely voters say that men who commit sexual assault face serious consequences less than half the time. More women than men hold those perceptions, 60 percent to 49 percent. Eight in 10 Democrats and just over 3 in 10 Republicans say men who commit such acts don’t face serious consequences most of the time. The Kavanaugh confirmation turned into a supercharged partisan fight, and the findings in the new Post-Schar School survey bear that out in responses to the questions about men and women. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say they are concerned that men can be accused unfairly of sexual assault, 76 percent vs. 34 percent. That argument was put forth by Trump and other Republicans as Kavanaugh fought to save his nomination. Conversely, Democrats are much more likely to say they worry that women who report sexual assaults are not believed, with 98 percent of Democrats saying they are concerned about this compared with 63 percent of Republicans. Democratic leaders had made that argument in defense of Ford, who they said should be believed although she only began to share news of her alleged assault decades after it happened. Among political independents, 59 percent say they are concerned that men close to them might be unfairly accused of sexual assault, while 74 percent are concerned about women not being believed when they report assault. On both questions, independents are somewhat closer to Republicans than Democrats. On the question of which of the two is the bigger problem, 92 percent of Democrats say it is that women are not believed, while 69 percent of Republicans say their concern is unfair accusations against men. Among independents, 55 percent say the bigger problem is women not being believed. The survey by The Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government was conducted in 69 congressional districts rated as competitive in late August by the team at the Cook Political Report and Post political staff. Surveys identified the major-party candidates by name in each district. This survey was a follow-up with voters who were initially interviewed in late September and early October. The survey, which was in the field Oct. 15-21, did not attempt to measure the state of races for the Senate. Results among the sample of 1,269 likely voters have an error margin of plus or minus three percentage points. Overall, there was little movement between the two polls, with 93 percent of those surveyed supporting the same candidate as in the first round. Of those who changed, 2 percent switched from Democrat to Republican and 2 percent switched from Republican to Democrat. The remainder switched from having no opinion to one of the parties. If anything, partisan attitudes hardened during the month. Today, 95 percent of Democrats say they support the Democratic candidate in their district, and 90 percent of Republicans support the GOP contender. In the first survey, 93 percent of Democrats and 87 percent of Republicans supported their party’s candidate. To the degree that Democrats have any edge in these districts, it is because of support from women, as was the case in the previous poll. Among likely voters, men favor Republican candidates by 51 to 46 percent, while women back Democrats by 55 to 42 percent. Nonwhite voters back Democrats 2 to 1, while white voters back Republicans by a statistically insignificant three points, 50 to 47 percent. Among white voters, small majorities of men with college degrees and without degrees and women without college degrees say they support Republican candidates. But white women with college degrees support Democratic candidates by a 23-point margin. Nearly twice as many likely voters who support Republican candidates say their vote is more in favor of the GOP candidate than against the Democrat, 51 percent to 27 percent. Voters who support Democrats also tend to say they are motivated more by support for the party’s candidate than opposition to the Republican, albeit by a smaller 45 percent to 29 percent margin. Interest in the election remains high, with a Washington Post-ABC News poll earlier this month finding 77 percent of registered voters saying they are certain to vote or have voted early, up from 65 percent in October 2014. Some people who say they will definitely vote end up not doing so, but in states that allow early voting, there has been an early surge of interest that could signal higher-than-normal turnout for midterm elections.

In fact, they voted 7 points more Republican than Democratic. In a story that aired and was published earlier, NPR conflated two meetings attended by high technology executives in which privacy was discussed.

During this conversation, we say that with his 1968 nomination to be chief justice, Abe Fortas became the first Supreme Court nominee to be rejected by the Senate since John Rutledge in 1795. In fact, Fortas' nomination for chief justice was withdrawn. And, seven nominations considered by the Senate were rejected between Rutledge's nomination and Fortas' in 1968. Also, we say that Fortas was the first nominee "to appear before the Judiciary Committee." In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service the first nominee to testify before the committee was Harlan Stone in 1925.

An earlier version of this story incorrectly states that a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found it takes physicians about 20 seconds longer per encounter to prescribe an antibiotic. In fact, it takes them about 20 fewer seconds. And, to clarify, that study was posted online Monday and officially published on Tuesday. In the audio of this story, as well as in a previous Web version, we incorrectly say there are 500 California condors in the wild. About 300 are in the wild and 200 are in captivity in breeding programs, zoos and preserves. An earlier version of this story characterized They'll Love Me When I'm Dead as a mockumentary. It is actually a satire. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Paul Manafort was a former Trump campaign manager. He served as Trump campaign chairman. A previous photo caption incorrectly referred to Barry Myers as leader of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In fact, he has been nominated to lead NOAA but has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Also, Michael Lewis says in the interview that the Trump administration has "appointed" Myers to run NOAA. In fact, Myers has been nominated. In this report, our guest indicates that Brett Kavanaugh would not have been drinking legally for at least half of the summer of 1982. Kavanaugh was only 17 that summer and would have been drinking illegally the entire time regardless of the change in the law. In this report, we should have identified the analyst who talks about the concerns in Europe. She is Theresa Fallon of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels. A previous version of this story misspelled one of Tokyo's airports as Henda. The correct spelling is Haneda. In a previous version of this story, we mistakenly referred to Prometheus as the Greek god of fire. In fact, Prometheus was one of the Titans, whom Webster's New World College Dictionary defines as "a race of giant deities who are overthrown by the Olympian gods."

Ron Popeil is not dead. The Veg-O-Matic is from inventor Samuel Popeil – Samuel's daughter Lisa donated the Veg-O-Matic after her father's death. Samuel Popeil's son, Ron Popeil, who founded Ronco Inventions and popularly marketed the device, is still alive.

His story asserted that Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to be the next CIA director, played a role in the treatment of al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah during interrogations at a "black site" in Thailand and that she had "mocked" Zubaydah. On March 15, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology. Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment. During this report, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded. She did run that site for a time after the Sept. 11 attacks, but as ProPublica has now acknowledged in a retraction of its reporting, she was not there when Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.

It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.

In fact, Cassio appears in Othello and Lepidus in Antony and Cleopatra, where his drinking becomes an issue, as well as in Julius Caesar.

The correct title is I'm Still Here. An earlier version of this story misidentified Alan Trammell as Jack Trammell. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Spider-Man 2 was only nominated for sound mixing and visual effects. In fact, it won for visual effects and was nominated for both sound mixing and sound editing. In addition, the story also said The Incredibles won for best animated feature in 2004. The movie was released in 2004 but won its Oscar in 2005. Also, the story said The Dark Knight was passed over for best picture in 2008. The movie came out in 2008, but the nominations and awards show were in 2009. In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses. Previously posted on Jan. 8: We say that Irish voters elected a gay, biracial prime minister. In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election — and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote.

A previous version of this Web story said Three Day Rule's database of singles came from partnerships with online dating sites. The company's singles database is separate from its online dating site partnerships. Previous audio and Web versions of this story suggested that Americans are no longer legally required to buy health insurance. That's incorrect. The individual mandate to buy health insurance that was part of the Affordable Care Act — requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face a financial penalty — is still in effect until 2019. Additionally, former President Barack Obama's first name was misspelled as Barak. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly referred to the movie In the Fade as Into the Fade.

Nevada is a longtime swing state that went to Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections.

In fact, some of that biodiesel will be made from other oils, including corn oil, canola oil and recycled cooking oil. A previous Web introduction to this story incorrectly stated that Matthew Kluger was a professor at George Mason University. He is a professor at Northwestern University. An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the DACA program will end in March 2017.

A previous version of this story misspelled James Toback's last name as Torbeck. In this story, we say that two members of Congress, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, have resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, Rep. Trent Franks also resigned, for a total of three. A previous version of this story described Straight, No Chaser as a Clint Eastwood film. Charlotte Zwerin directed the film. Eastwood produced it.

However, the $2 million to $3 million number refers to the estimated boost to the local economy from the Fiona-related sales and tourism. We say President Trump's cognitive test took 30 minutes to complete. In fact, the White House physician did not say how long the test lasted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment typically takes about 10 minutes.

Nelson as saying, "Two days ago, my brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles laid hands upon my hands." In fact, Nelson said "laid hands upon my head."

In fact, the decline in mortality is not limited to the unemployed. An earlier version of this story misspelled Johnathon Shillings' first name as Johnathan. A previous photo caption in this story said Ben and Tara were married in 2014 and Ben was diagnosed two years later. They were actually married in 2015 and Ben was diagnosed in 2016. A previous version of this story was missing the 12:30 a.m. time stamp, when investigators noted that the privacy settings on Marilou Danley's Facebook account had been changed.

The Census Bureau has conducted previous tests of potential questions, and participants in Providence County can take part in the last scheduled field test beginning in March. A previous version of this story misspelled Timothy Piazza's last name as Piazzaz. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we say historian Danielle McGuire met Recy Taylor on President Barack Obama's Inauguration Day in 2008. The correct year is 2009. A previous version of this story referred to Dartmouth College as Dartmouth University. The audio of this story incorrectly states that Tonya Harding landed the first triple axel in Olympics competition history.

A previous version of this story misspelled Allen Ginsberg's last name as Ginsburg. An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to U. S. Customs and Border Patrol.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said Steve Bannon had been the chairman of the Trump campaign. He was the CEO. A previous version of the Web story incorrectly stated that more than half of the nation's Latino population lives in Los Angeles. It should have said that in Los Angeles, about half of the population is Latino. A previous version of this story referred to Meghan Markle as a princess-to-be. In fact, she will not be known as Princess Meghan. It is more likely that the queen will make Prince Harry a duke and Markle will become a duchess. A previous version of this story said Iceland has had a law against pay discrimination since 1963; in fact, the law passed in 1961. A previous headline misstated the title of the film as In The Land Of The Pomegranates; the correct title has no second "the." Also, because of an error in the press materials, Hava Kohav Beller's first name was misspelled as Hova. A previous version of this story said the Dow rose 4,000 points over the last four months. It rose by that amount over the last 10 months. This post has been updated to include comments from Mark Memmott. A previous caption misidentified Interstate 16 as Interstate 26. The audio of this story describes Papa, Jake and Kevin as elementary school students. They're actually eighth-graders, but in Chicago, kindergarten through eighth grade is referred to as elementary school. A previous version of this story said Republican Joshua Cole was certified as the winner in District 28. In fact, Republican Robert Thomas was certified as the winner. Cole is a Democrat. A previous version of this story misspelled the name of music publisher Wixen as Wixin. An earlier Web version of this story credited some information to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. The information came from the American Veterinary Medical Association.

In fact, the Times reported that Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had collected potentially damaging information about Democratic political candidate Hillary Clinton. An earlier transcript referred to Luxembourg for Finance as a government bank. In fact, it is the agency for the development of the Luxembourg financial center. A previous version of this story said that if Mitt Romney ran for Senate from Utah, it would be his first run for Congress. Romney ran for Senate in 1994, losing to Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy. Additionally, Orrin Hatch and Thad Cochran were incorrectly referred to as Senate pro tempore. The correct term is president pro tempore. The original story incorrectly stated that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida came in second place in the 2016 Utah GOP caucuses. It was Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published. A correction posted here on Feb. 22 has been removed because it mistakenly stated that President Reagan signed that commission into law. In fact, it was President Carter. An earlier version of this story identified Sarah Broderick as CEO/CFO of Vice. She is COO/CFO. In previous audio and a Web introduction for this page, we said President Trump named Jerusalem the capital of Israel. In fact, he didn't name it as the capital; he said the U.S. would recognize it as the capital. In this story, Nikki Haley is described incorrectly as the U.S. ambassador to the United States. In fact, she is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. A previous Web version of this story misstated the name of Oxford American's deputy editor. He is Maxwell George, not George Maxwell.
