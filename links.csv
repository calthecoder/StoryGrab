2.0-split-http://www.rollcall.com/author/johnbennettcqrollcall-com-split-President Donald Trump again deflected any responsibility for the string of pipe bombs mailed to Democratic officials and a major news organization. “There’s no blame,” he said Friday, when asked if he feels any responsibility due to his sharp rhetoric.  A large group of young African-American leaders gathered Friday in the East Room of the White House to hear from President Donald Trump, and they were treated to a campaign rally in miniature. If White House observers closed their eyes around midday, the president could have been speaking to supporters inside an airport hangar in Wisconsin or a basketball arena in Texas or a 63-year-old minor league hockey arena in North Carolina.  Updated 12:53 p.m. | Federal authorities have arrested a man in Florida in connection with a string of suspicious devices that were mailed to prominent Democrats and CNN. Trump confirmed the arrest Friday, saying he was “committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop” politically motivated violent acts.  For President Donald Trump, the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats this week appear to only be about spoiling a Republican Party on cruise control. That was the president’s message on Friday, when he said media outlets are covering a string of mail bombs sent to leading Democrats and CNN to distract voters from an election cycle he believes favor Republicans. “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,” he said in a tweet.  As federal authorities inspect a possible explosive device addressed to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., President Donald Trump is blaming the media for fomenting political tribalism. Trump twice read prepared statements Wednesday condemning a list of pipe bombs sent to some of his political foes, mostly current and former Democratic politicians and officials the president often sharply criticizes at campaign rallies and on Twitter.  President Donald Trump said the “full weight” of the federal government is seeking to find and punish those responsible for building and sending explosive devices to current and former Democratic lawmakers. “The safety of the American people is my highest … priority,” he said, adding that top explosives experts are examining each device.  ANALYSIS | The recipients of explosive devices sent this week have so far shared a commonality: harsh criticism by President Donald Trump and far-right followers. But White House officials were in no mood Wednesday to entertain the notion that the president’s descriptions of Democrats as “evil” and news organizations as the “enemy of the people” might have helped lead a bomber to build devices and mail them to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and CNN. A building in Miami that houses an office for former Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also evacuated Wednesday.   President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will leave much of the U.S. response to the death of Jamal Khashoggi in the hands of Congress, calling Saudi Arabia’s efforts to muddy what happened to the Washington Post journalist “the worst cover-up ever.” Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration is revoking visas for some Saudi officials believed to be involved in Khashoggi’s death.  Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Paris next month, their second one-on-one meeting this year as the Justice Department continues looking into whether the president’s 2016 campaign sought help from Moscow. National security adviser John Bolton made the announcement — another reversal from the White House — in Moscow, where he has been meeting with Russian officials about a decades-old nuclear treaty from which Trump says he intends to withdraw.  Embattled Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein finally testifies. The Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its autumn of discontent. And President Donald Trump will sign opioids legislation before taking his midterms road show to Wisconsin. No, Wednesday will not be your typical recess day. Rather, it will be a cable news bonanza chronicling the country’s era of tribal political warfare.  Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s description of a Saudi plot to kill Washington journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who died inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey, “flies in the face” of the royal family’s previous descriptions of what happened, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday. “We will look for ways to hold accountable” those Saudis proved to be involved, Pence said.  As President Donald Trump and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz shared a stage Monday evening in Houston, the former bitter rivals proved that one should never say never in politics. “We had our little difficulties,” Trump told rallygoers at the Toyota Center, before calling Cruz now a “good friend.”  President Donald Trump said any vote on a new tax overhaul bill he floated this weekend would come “after the election,” saying a “resolution” would be introduced in the next two weeks. Trump’s remarks amounted to a presidential clarification of his own vague comments on Saturday, when he told reporters Republicans are “looking at putting in a very major tax cut for middle-income people.”  President Donald Trump says he is still “not satisfied” with the Saudi Arabian government’s explanation of what led to the death of Washington journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are calling on Trump to punish the Saudi royal family for coaxing the self-exiled Saudi citizen to the Istanbul facility and allegedly killing him before dismembering his corpse.  The Trump administration has “its eyes wide open” about what happened to a dead Washington Post columnist who was killed inside a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey, White House adviser Jared Kushner said Monday. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law also said he personally told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to “just to be transparent” about allegations his government ordered Saudi-born and self-exiled journalist Jamal Khashoggi killed inside its Istanbul consulate.  Without offering evidence to support the claim, President Donald Trump on Monday contended a large caravan of Central American migrants also includes “unknown Middle Easterners.” He also threatened to end foreign aid to countries from which most members of the caravan come. That list includes Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Trump has proposed foreign aid cuts before, only to have Republican and Democratic lawmakers reject them and allocate the funds via massive spending bills Trump was forced to sign to avert more government shutdowns on his watch.  The DNA test released by Sen. Elizabeth Warren showing a distant Native American ancestor is “bogus,” President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday as his feud with the Massachusetts Democrat escalated. Warren on Monday made public the results of a DNA test conducted by a Stanford University expert she says supports her claims of Native American ancestry. Other experts had questioned her claim, and Trump said he would donate $1 million to charity if it was proved true.  President Donald Trump appears ready to believe the Saudi king’s rejection of charges he had a Washington Post journalist killed, using language almost identical to his statements that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials of election meddling. “Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened ‘to our Saudi Arabian citizen,’” Trump tweeted Monday morning.  Brett M. Kavanaugh looked bewildered. Sen. Kamala Harris looked perturbed but determined. It was hour ten of the then-Supreme Court nominee’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee early last month, and the California Democrat seemed to have him backed into a corner. Harris, a former prosecutor, was very much back in a courtroom. She was trying to get her witness, Kavanaugh, to reveal the name — or names — of anyone at the Washington law firm of Trump’s personal attorney with whom she alleged he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his ongoing Russia election meddling investigation the president almost daily refers to as a “witch hunt.” THE SOURCE FOR NEWS ON CAPITOL HILL SINCE 1955 Want insight more often?  Get Roll Call in your inbox  ×

(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Updated | After weeks of contentious back-and-forth between House GOP lawmakers and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general was finally set to answer some questions about comments he allegedly made about covertly recording President Donald Trump — until a last-minute postponement, that is, put off the highly anticipated sit-down. Rosenstein, who appears to have patched up his relationship with the president after reportedly preparing late last month to tender his resignation, was to field questions from just four leaders on the joint Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform panel — Republican Chairmen Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy and Democratic ranking members Jerrold Nadler and Elijah Cummings.

5.0-split-http://www.rollcall.com-split-White House Black Leadership Event Turns Into Mini-Trump Rally FBI: Mail Bombs Were ‘Not Hoax Devices’ Latest News Harris Staffer Tyrone Gayle Dies After Cancer Battle Trump Confirms Arrest in Package Bomb Case as Targets Mount McSally Bills Herself as ‘Firewall’ Against Democratic Takeover of Senate What’s That Sound? The Monster in the Budget Politics The Last of the Gingrich Revolutionaries It was nearly 24 years ago that Republicans swept into power in stunning fashion, ending 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. But those 73 new Republicans who came to the House and 11 who came to the Senate on the 1994 wave engineered by Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America” have now dwindled down to a handful, and after this election only seven will likely be left in Congress. For his part, Gingrich, a supporter of President Donald Trump, doesn’t see this as the end of an era, but a continuation of a revolution that began in 1964, with presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator. “I think we were the natural evolution that went Goldwater, Reagan, ’94 Contract, Trump,” he said. “I think there’s a very natural evolution of those things.” Two members of the Class of 1994 are retiring this year: New Jersey Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. In January, the two likely remaining continuously serving GOP House members will be Reps. Mac Thornberry of Texas and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the latter of whom has said the 2018 election will be his last. Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, another 1994 alum, lost in 2008, but won back his seat two years later in a rematch. Thornberry and Jones are both in races rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Chabot, however, faces a competitive re-election against Democrat Aftab Pureval in the 1st District, which Inside Elections rates Leans Republican. Three current Republican senators started their careers in the House in 1995: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma has served continuously in the Senate since 1995. Of the four, Wicker is the only one up for re-election this year, bidding for a second full Senate term. Inside Elections rates his race against Democrat David Baria, the state House minority leader, Solid Republican. Burr won a third Senate term two years ago after announcing it would be his last. Back in 2014, Gingrich lamented what had become of his caucus. At a reunion of the Class of 1994, he said, “The fact that we do not have positive themes and positive issues is going to cost us seats this fall.” As it turned out, Republicans picked up 13 seats in the House that year and retook control of the Senate.

Politics For Trump, Pipe Bombs Sent to Opponents Is Ploy to Halt GOP ‘Momentum’ Before Midterms For President Donald Trump, the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats this week appear to only be about spoiling a Republican Party on cruise control. That was the president’s message on Friday, when he said media outlets are covering a string of mail bombs sent to leading Democrats and CNN to distract voters from an election cycle he believes favor Republicans. “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,” he said in a tweet. By putting the word “bomb” in quotation marks, the president appeared to question whether the devices, which federal experts say were not capable of exploding, meet the definition of a bomb. As Election Day has neared, the forecast for the midterms has tightened, with Democrats still favored to win a majority in the House, with the number of projected pickups fluctuating and a Senate dynamic continuing to show multiple GOP routes to holding the majority in that chamber. The Trump midterm campaign message has focused largely on firing up his base to drive up conservative voter turnout in key states and districts with competitive House and Senate races. He used the attempted bombings to continue that strategy. “Very unfortunate, what is going on,” he said of the bomb drama and nationwide manhunt. “Republicans, go out and vote!” Packages, all mailed in manila envelopes with Forever stamps, were sent to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, actor Robert DeNiro, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Rep. Maxine Waters of California. CNN’s New York offices were evacuated Tuesday when that outlet got a mail bomb addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan. The count jumped again on Friday, with suspicious packages addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. All have been sharply criticized by the president. But his top aides reject that he has any responsibility and say his often bleak and derisive rhetoric has nothing to do with the violent background developing.

Keith Ellison Trailing in New Poll for Minnesota Attorney General Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Keeps Even Partisan Split Just How Average Are the Average Voters in Campaign Ads?  ‘Congress Too’ Founders Launch Fundraising Effort for Fired Pregnant Staffer Bernie Sanders Blasts Donald Trump for Weakness in ‘Taking on the Dictator of Saudi Arabia’ Spartacus, Apprenticeships and a Cat Watching C-SPAN: Congressional Hits and Misses No One — Not Even Republicans — Likes Congress What Will Happen if Democrats Win Opinion A Traitor to the Pundit Class, I Enter the No-Predictions Zone OPINION — To watch the World Series or the baseball playoffs is an invitation to enter the realm of the irrelevant statistic. When the Red Sox pushed across their first run in the first inning Monday night, a Fox announcer burbled that Boston also scored in the first inning of the opening game when they won the Series in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Of course, no players from 2004 and 2007 are on the active Red Sox roster — and scoring in the second or fifth inning can also be an effective way of winning a ballgame. Highlighted on the screen every night are the postseason stats of the players, even though the Dodgers, for example, played just 11 games to advance to the World Series. Virtually invisible during the telecasts are what the players accomplished during the full 162-game season, even though these numbers have infinitely more predictive value. Those of us who closely follow politics can easily feel superior to the statistical naïfs in the World Series broadcast booth. But often we fall into a similar trap — the arrogant belief that the future is knowable if you crunch enough numbers. The 2018 midterms have brought a new level of sophistication to political analysis. The New York Times in conjunction with Siena College has completed more than 60 congressional polls with the real-time results flashed on the computer screen with each call. Polling analysts like Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight have honed their predictive models. And traditional race-by-race handicappers like Nathan Gonzales, Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball do an exemplary job on the granular level. Yet, even after hearing cautionary words about polling and polling analysis, we tend to overreact to every statistical gyration. A Rutgers-Eagleton Senate poll from New Jersey, released Wednesday, shows scandal-scarred Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez up by just 5 points in a state that Hillary Clinton carried by 14 points. Is the race tightening? Could Democrats blow a seemingly safe seat? Or is the poll just a margin-of-error quirk? Multiply this reaction by nearly 500 contested races for Congress and governor, and you have a rough sense of the stress levels on both sides less than 300 hours before the polls open on Election Day. The truth is that all the polling in the world cannot prepare you for a midterm election with this broad a terrain. And there are many hard-fought House races, like in Maine’s 2nd District, where there have only been a handful of reputable polls. Sure, broad questions like the generic ballot (“Do you prefer a Congress controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans?”) can offer national clues. But is the Democrats’ current 8-point average edge on this question enough to comfortably overcome the GOP-leaning effects of incumbency and gerrymandering in the House? A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll of 69 hotly contested House districts found the two parties effectively tied. But is this good news for the Republicans because they are holding their own in battleground races? Or is this a formula for a Democratic sweep since more than 90 percent of the districts surveyed are currently GOP held? Knotty questions like these can make political pundits sound like medieval theologians debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. At a certain level there are no hard truths about the 2018 elections yet — only personal tendencies towards optimism or pessimism. After enduring Election Night 2016, many Democrats are like battered children brooding that once again victory (this time, winning the House) will be snatched from their grasp. Similarly, there are Republicans who believe that Donald Trump will help them defy the polls, while other GOP strategists privately worry that a president with no impulse control is leading them to political doom. For all the twitchiness of the political class, it is also worth remembering that the prevalence of early voting in many states cuts into the ability of a single late-breaking event to reshape the midterms. Already, in early-voting states, we are approaching the point when it is too late to effectively drop opposition research. Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States Sometimes politics is simply perverse. This is not a reference to the Trump triumph in 2016, but rather to an earlier midterm election that should serve as a cautionary tale for all those eager to make glib predictions. In 1986, the Democrats won seven Senate seats by a collective margin of 98,000 votes. Those 98,000 votes were the difference between a 55-45 Democratic Senate and one that was controlled by the GOP. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill said triumphantly after the election, “If there was a Reagan revolution, it’s over.” In the 1960s, an ad campaign for Schlitz, a century-old Milwaukee beer, featured the tagline, “You only go around once in life — go for all the gusto you can.” In elections, as well, you only go around once. So it doesn’t matter that in some alternate universe Hillary Clinton is president and the Republicans held the Senate for Ronald Reagan in 1986. Whatever happens on Nov. 6 will seem foreordained by the gods, but in truth, it will be just one of dozens of equally plausible outcomes. What four decades covering politics has taught me more than anything is humility. Neither I nor anyone practicing punditry on cable TV has the gift of prophesy. But, if I had to guess, I would say that the election comes down to how voters sort out the three dominant fundamentals: A booming economy, albeit with a suddenly shaky stock market. A president who violates every rule of decency with his incessant fearmongering and vicious attacks. And a Democratic Party able to aggressively compete across a broad swatch of GOP-held House districts while grappling with a Senate map wildly tilted toward the Republicans. Beyond that, I will be a traitor to the pundit class as I dispense with glib predictions. Instead, I will bow toward the unknowable as I breathlessly wait until the returns come in on Election Night.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Kyrsten Sinema is trying to do something that no Arizona Democrat has done in 30 years: win a Senate election. “We know we can win this election,” the three-term congresswoman told supporters packed into a union hall here Sunday. “This year, the votes in the Senate matter.” And unlike Democrats in other red or purple states from Texas to Georgia who are running on decidedly progressive platforms, she’s making her case as a moderate with appeal to independents and pragmatic Republicans as she takes on GOP Rep. Martha McSally. If Democrats have any hope of taking back the Senate or mitigating potential losses in red states, they need to win Arizona. But to do that, Sinema will also need to turn out the party faithful in high numbers. It’s a delicate balancing act that few Democrats have been able to accomplish in Arizona in recent years — it’s been a decade since the party last won a statewide race. “Midterms are hard [for Democrats] to win in Arizona, which tells you why Sinema is such a phenomenon, that she’s even keeping it close,” Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said in an interview at a Phoenix coffee shop. Democrats believe the state is trending in their direction, but it’s not clear if Sinema’s strategy will be enough to win this year. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. Recent polls have shown Sinema’s once small, but steady, lead nearly evaporate, with McSally even inching ahead in some surveys. And a loss could have Democrats rethinking how they win a state like Arizona. Also Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange Sinema does have a math problem. Republicans and those not registered with a party still outnumber registered Democrats in the Grand Canyon State. That partisan divide makes some Democrats nervous. Karen Lieneke, a 65-year-old English as a second language teacher in Tucson, said she was “cautiously optimistic” that Sinema could actually win. “The climate of fear and the climate of really raw politics is a wild card to me,” Lieneke said at the union hall. Sinema, a former state legislator, has been helped by an aggressive ad campaign touting herself as a moderate and an independent lawmaker. She was on television as early as April, and went largely unchallenged on the airwaves as McSally battled two others in a competitive GOP primary. Democrats say Arizonans recognize that the once self-described “most liberal legislator in the state” has shifted to the center since first coming to Congress in 2012. In a recent radio interview, Sinema said it was difficult to call herself a proud Democrat, opting instead to call herself a “proud Arizonan.” She has acknowledged her ideological shift — an analysis by CQ Vote Watch found she supported the president’s priorities 60 percent of the time, the third-highest score among House Democrats. “Over the years I am proud to say I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally change my opinion,” she said at a recent debate. But Republicans are trying to paint Sinema as a radical liberal, and highlighting past footage of her knocking the Grand Canyon State. “You guys haven’t reported on Sinema calling our state crazy and saying we’re the meth lab for democracy,” McSally chided reporters after touring a technical school in Avondale on Wednesday. “Every single day something is coming out related to her campaign that’s actually legit, her showing disdain for our state.” The National Republican Senatorial Committee in a recent television ad used video of Sinema implying in 2011 that Arizona produces “crazy,” but the tactic might not work with everyone. Dorothy Byrne, a 77-year-old Phoenix resident not registered with any party, is backing Sinema this year (and all Democrats to protest what she sees as a divisive GOP-controlled government). “Tell us what you want to do today,” Byrne said Monday while waiting to hear Democrat Hiral Tipirneni address a town hall meeting in Arizona’s 8th District. “I don’t care what you did 20 years ago. I didn’t do the same things 20 years ago.” Byrne supported GOP Sen. John McCain in 2016, but wasn’t inclined to support McSally this year. “We need things back a little more in balance,” she said. Democrats see a path to victory with the support of nonpartisan voters like Byrne and moderate Republican women. But Sinema also has to make sure that moderate image doesn’t turn off loyal party members, whom she also needs to turn out in large numbers. Arizona may not yet be a blue state, but it isn’t as red as it used to be. President Donald Trump won it by 4 points in 2016, smaller than his margin in the traditional swing state of Ohio. Democrats supporting Sinema packed two union halls Sunday as she traveled from Tucson to Phoenix to stress the importance of voting early. Not everyone in the room was thrilled with her moderate positions, but they still showed up. “I agree with the president essentially never,” Emily Dacey, 31, said at the Phoenix event, adding that she wished Sinema would be more adamantly opposed to Trump. “But I’m not getting to choose my ideal person,” Dacey said. “I’m getting to choose between Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally. And I’m here to fight for her because she still stands more with me than McSally does.” Democrats are touting an extensive field operation as evidence of energy on the left. The joint effort between the Arizona Democratic Party and Sinema’s campaign boasts 25 field offices and 4,000 volunteers across the state. Over the weekend, volunteers knocked on 65,000 doors, the most ever in one weekend, according to Sinema’s campaign. Gallego said there was a focus on getting out the vote this year and that turning out Latino and Native American voters were key to a Democratic victory. But so far, early ballot returns give Republicans an edge. As of Wednesday evening, 44 percent of the early ballot returns were from Republicans, while 33 percent were from Democrats. Gallego, who is weighing a Senate run of his own in 2020, said future efforts may have to concentrate more on turning out the Democratic base. He said an emphasis on voter registration could close the gap as the state shifts demographically with its growing cities. “Arizona’s changing. It just is,” said DJ Quinlan, the former executive director of the state Democratic Party. “The notion that Arizona is this bright red state is no longer accurate. It’s going to be a swing state from this point forward” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Opinion One Person, One Vote. Is It That Complicated? OPINION — I admit that voting is and has always been a celebratory ritual for me, even if the candidate is running unopposed, the office is state agriculture commissioner or my district’s makeup means my one vote won’t make much of a difference. I watched three older siblings march for civil rights, and I am well aware that many brave folks died protecting my right to cast that ballot. While a little rain or a busy schedule might provide an excuse to “sit this one out,” it’s never enough to outweigh the legacy left by a Medgar Evers, who served his country in World War II and was murdered in front of his Mississippi home for, among other civil rights activity, leading voter registration drives in the country he protected. Mine is not a controversial stand — in fact, it’s patriotic. You would think our country’s leaders, without regard to party or politics, would be on my side. You would be wrong. When Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 wrote the majority opinion gutting key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — those that compelled certain states to “preclear” any changes in their voting rules — he insisted that so much had changed in the country that those rules were no longer needed. “The Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Racism is dead, or on its last legs, he seemed to declare. I would not call Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent cynical. It was realistic. As she wrote: “As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abundantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as attempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that originally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.” What Year Is It? Trump’s Midterm Rallies Are Mostly About His 2020 Re-Election Bid In a perfect country, politicians would rejoice at the chance to win the hearts and minds of constituents with strong policies, to show how inclusive their party’s big tent could be. But we are not living in Oz, no matter how much the judges who joined Roberts in the majority decision might have wished. As Ginsburg predicted, the poll taxes, literary tests and lynchings may have disappeared. But the intent remained in full force. The 2013 Shelby County v. Holder ruling was a green light for the shenanigans the federal government once prevented states from pulling. Moving of polling places. Strict ID restrictions targeting minorities, the poor, the elderly and the young. Same-day registrations that made voting easier for those working two and three job. Purges of voting lists. The list was limited only by the imaginations of those making it. And boy, did the folks who wanted to choose their voters, instead of letting their voters choose them, have great imaginations. These new tactics are in bold view in the midterm elections of 2018, with states still mired in lawsuits over restrictions legislators have justified as a fight against that boogeyman, voter fraud, which every study has proved insignificant. In North Dakota, the votes of the original Americans, Native Americans, have been disproportionately jeopardized by a ruling that says a street address rather than a post office box on registrations is required in that sparsely populated state. In North Carolina, a voter ID bill that has been thrown out by the courts for targeting minority voters with “almost surgical precision” may yet rise from the dead if an amendment to the state’s constitution passes. Georgia is in a category all by itself. Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, has refused to recuse himself from his day job of secretary of state, which puts him in charge of overseeing elections, including his own. Cozy, wouldn’t you say? Even GOP secretary of state and Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, the king of efforts to suppress the vote to fight hordes of supposed illegal voters, has passed his election duties over to a deputy. Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first African-American woman elected governor in this country. What some see as evidence of how far America has come, others see as reason for a second civil war, this time on voting rights. Georgia election officials have been accused of tossing out a disproportionate number of absentee ballots from minority voters, and holding up close to 53,000 voter registrations because they do not satisfy a controversial “exact match” requirement with all other government documents. (An errant hyphen or period might be the culprit.) A county official kicked black senior citizens off a bus that was heading to the polls, as if those senior citizens had not already heard enough government officials tell them “no.” What side is the president on? “All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING,” Trump tweeted. “Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!” Not exactly an invitation — more like a warning and a threat. It’s no surprise from a president who insisted the 3 million votes that gave Hillary Clinton a popular vote win in 2016 were the result of illegal voters and fraud. His administration’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, with Kobach front and center, charged with tracking down those voters, I suspect was disbanded for lack of evidence and because state election officials turned their bipartisan backs on requests for intrusive voting records. The integrity and the results of the elections coming up in two weeks could be called into question because of the fruits of that Supreme Court decision. The country is facing the prospect of having an election with results that few trust, to be decided at a later date. All these conflicts will have repercussions long after the midterms — resentments and accusations and an America more divided than ever, sowing more distrust in institutions, this time not law enforcement or the media, but democracy itself. I wish, for his family and our country’s sake, that Medgar Evers were alive, though his spirit and resolve live on in the work of many. There is still so much work to do. Mary C.

Politics The Coincidence of Bomb Recipients, Trump and Far-Right Rhetoric ANALYSIS | The recipients of explosive devices sent this week have so far shared a commonality: harsh criticism by President Donald Trump and far-right followers. But White House officials were in no mood Wednesday to entertain the notion that the president’s descriptions of Democrats as “evil” and news organizations as the “enemy of the people” might have helped lead a bomber to build devices and mail them to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and CNN. A building in Miami that houses an office for former Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also evacuated Wednesday. Trump’s aides declined to comment beyond a statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning what she called “attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures.” “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” Sanders said. Vice President Mike Pence later tweeted his condemnation of the attempted bombings; Trump tweeted this agreement. I agree wholeheartedly! https://t.co/ndzu0A30vU  [Suspicious Package Cases Grow, Debbie Wasserman Schultz First Known Congressional Target] But the matter has one glaring common denominator: Trump’s sharp rhetoric about each recipient and a highly partisan midterm election that has only deepened a widely divided country’s tribal wounds. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” chanted a rally crowd Monday night in Houston, where Trump was firing up the base as he and Sen. Ted Cruz tried to keep the senator’s seat in Republican hands. Trump pivoted from one topic to the next in the manner that defines his raucous stream-of-consciousness rallies, heading straight toward a line sure to ignite the Toyota Center crowd: “If you want the fake news to finally investigate Hillary Clinton, we’ll just have…” That’s when the familiar chant broke out. “Man,” an impressed Trump said before trying to pass off any responsibility: “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.” But if the president was concerned his constant calls for his former political foe to face a federal investigation, it certainly didn’t stop him. “So if you want them to investigate, we’ll just have to nominate Hillary Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. How do you like that?” he said as the crowd booed loudly. “Right? Let’s see how she does. If [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh had to go through what he went through ... can you imagine Hillary up there? That would take three to four years of questions.” His supporters laughed in unison. Trump used the line about Clinton to move into his ramped-up rhetoric about all Democrats, saying the midterms are all about preventing “the radical Democrat mob” from taking “a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country and our economy.” Monday night’s rally alone featured multiple sharp attacks on Democrats as the president eagerly accuses the opposition party of being the “party of crime” that wants to allow undocumented migrants pour over the U.S.-Mexico border to flood the country with crime and drugs while raising taxes and ending programs like Social Security and Medicaid. He blasted Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke for voting for what he called “Obama amnesty.” Trump told the crowd in Houston that Immigration and Border Control officers are fighting “a war” against undocumented individuals — and he essentially told them to blame Obama. “They go in and they take them and they throw them into the paddy wagon, then get them the hell out of our country. We’ve removed thousands, thousands of them. They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people,” he said. “And the towns are liberated. ... I’m telling you, it’s like a war.” Watching a single “Make America Great Again” rally shows how the president’s supporters direct their ire at his political foes, especially Clinton and CNN. A mere mention of the “fake news media” elicited an unprompted chant in Houston: “CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!” “I don’t like them either, OK?” Trump said. Trump is slated to lead rallies Wednesday night in Wisconsin, Friday night in North Carolina and Saturday in Illinois. White House officials gave no indication that he is considering canceling one or all in an attempt to cool down the country’s white-hot political climate. Sanders did not respond to an email asking whether Trump is concerned his words might have played a role in the bomber’s mindset, and if he might cancel one or all of those rallies. Wasserman-Schultz has been a target of Trump’s rhetoric for several years, with her stint at the DNC putting her on his radar. As the 2016 general election was about to heat up, Trump fired off this tweet: “The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she’s out!” [Trump’s Tax Cut Gambit Gets Heads Scratching] Then there’s Soros. Trump on Oct. 5 lashed out at Soros in a tweet, blaming him for financing left-wing protesters who lined Capitol Hill hallways and Washington streets objecting to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!” the president tweeted, adding this hashtag: “#Troublemakers.” The president has also floated the idea, without evidence, that Democrats are financing a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico and heading for the U.S. border. “It was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,” Pence said Monday in the Oval Office before being interrupted by his boss. “And the Democrats, maybe? And the Democrats?” Trump asked with a chuckle. “Well,” Pence started to say before he was cut off. CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked Trump for proof of the Democrat’s involvement. “You know what? You’re going to find out, and we’re going to see,” he said, again offering no evidence. The list of targets grew as did the glare of their shared commonality. Sanders responded with a second statement around midday Wednesday, this time via Twitter. “Our condemnation of these dispicable [sic] acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of explosive devices mailed to the news network and several prominent Democratic politicians and donors. “These cowardly acts are unacceptable and wont be tolerated.” This is an ongoing situation that President Trump and his admin are monitoring closely.

Martha McSally continues to face criticism for her vote to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act, and engaged in a heated exchange with a local reporter over protections for people with pre-existing conditions after an event Wednesday. “I have fought for pre-existing conditions. I voted to protect pre-existing conditions. This is personal,” the Arizona Republican told reporters after touring the Universal Technical Institute. Brahm Resnik of the Phoenix NBC affiliate interjected, noting the GOP measure to repeal the 2010 health care law would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange “It’s not true. It’s not true. Stop parroting Democratic talking points,” McSally said. “Health care is a complex issue. Right now it’s not working. Right now people with pre-existing conditions can’t get access to health care on the health insurance market or the individual insurance market because Obamacare has failed.” The GOP bill, known as the American Health Care Act, included a provision that prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. However, it also provided states an avenue to waive certain regulations, which could have allowed insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for coverage, potentially rendering health care unaffordable. McSally voted for the GOP bill, and reportedly told her Republican colleagues the day of the vote to get this “f---ing thing” done. McSally’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has made health care central to her campaign. The two lawmakers are competing in an open seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Sinema accused McSally in a tweet Wednesday of lying about her record in response to a new McSally television ad where she said she has worked to force insurance companies to protect people with pre-existing conditions. “Here’s the truth: I voted to protect coverage for the 2.8 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions,” Sinema tweeted. “Martha voted to take it away.” Inside Elections with Nathan L.

Politics NARAL Launches Final Push to Fire Up Abortion Rights Voters With voters already casting ballots in states that allow early voting, outside advocacy groups are not just trying to reach potential new voters — they’re working to make sure their most ardent supporters actually show up. That is certainly the case with NARAL, which is announcing a final push to make sure that the abortion rights group’s supporters get out to vote in 2018. The organization is launching a new $750,000 campaign that will feature direct mail and digital advertising geared toward supporters in 17 key races as the campaign cycle nears its end. According to a listing provided to Roll Call ahead of formal release, the mailers are being directed to Senate contests in Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada and Wisconsin. According to a summary of the plan for the final weeks, which was provided first to Roll Call, the House races involved include key seats in Arizona, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. NARAL is also targeting the governor’s races in Iowa, New Mexico and Nevada. NARAL is trying to make sure that the group’s core supporters, many of whom were recently even more engaged over the Senate confirmation process of Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, actually make it to the polls (either through early voting where it’s possible or on Election Day). “Based on the energy we are seeing from voters across the country, we’re supercharging our program to move voters to elect pro-choice champions.The stakes have never been higher,” said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue. “The threat to Roe v. Wade is real and on the horizon.” “Women are fired up and ready to elect candidates in their communities who support us and our families. Our job is to reach as many of them as possible in the next two weeks,” Hogue said. In addition to a national umbrella digital ad, the group’s produced several for individual candidates, including Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The direct mail and new round of digital ads in many of the same jurisdictions are beyond $5 million in midterm-related spending already, including a previously announced $1 million for TV and digital ads and $750,000 for an earlier campaign effort.

Politics GOP Ads Target Young Female Voters on Violence Against Women Act An outside group dedicated to electing Republican women is launching digital ads urging three lawmakers to support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire in December. The digital ads, obtained first by Roll Call, target Reps. Mimi Walters of California and Barbara Comstock of Virginia — both facing tough re-elections — and Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, who’s running for Senate. All three are being challenged by Democratic women. In a year that’s seen high enthusiasm among female voters for Democratic candidates, especially in suburban districts, these issue ads try to highlight GOP lawmakers’ advocacy for women. Republicans are at risk of seeing the number of women in their House conference decline next year. Running on Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Hulu, the ads are targeted to younger women, softer Republican voters and independents, and are backed by a six-figure digital buy across the three states. The ads are part of the MyRoar campaign, which is paid for by Winning for Women. The group’s PAC has endorsed all three women, who are also identified as “Lionesses” on the MyRoar website. One version of the ad begins by explaining the Violence Against Women Act. “What if there was a law that provided defense for victims of sexual assault?” the narrator asks. “Well that law expires in just months,” the narrator continues. “But what if I told you you could help the efforts of women like Congresswoman Barbara Comstock to keep it alive when Congress returns?” “What if I told you that you could be heard?” the narrator says, as the face of a young woman appears on screen. Another version of the ad opens with statistics about rape and sexual assault and the percentage of the offenders who see jail time. Things would be “a lot worse” without the Violence Against Women Act, the narrator says. “Congresswoman Mimi Walters has been working hard for women. Learn how to help Mimi keep working to pass a bigger, better Violence Against Women Act when Congress returns,” the narrator says. The Violence Against Women Act was supposed to expire on Sept. 30, but it was extended under a stopgap spending bill in September. Led by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats have introduced legislation to reauthorize the law with updates, including a provision that would prohibit those under protective order from possessing firearms. No Republicans have signed on to the Democratic proposal. Flashback: Democrats Hope to Extend Violence Against Women Act GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and John J. Faso of New York and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced their own six-month reauthorization legislation in September. Walters is listed as a co-sponsor on that measure. Comstock and McSally are not. Forty-six Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last month asking for urgent action to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act before its Sept. 30 expiration. Comstock and Walters signed on to that letter. McSally did not. “In Congress, all three of these women have a strong track record of supporting legislation that promotes and empowers women. Each is a warrior. And we look forward to their continued commitment to the Violence Against Women Act and to victims of violence and sexual assault across the country,” Winning For Women Executive Director Rebecca Schuller said in a statement. Comstock is running for a third term in Virginia's 10th District against Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates her race Tilts Democratic.

Meanwhile, in Non-Pipe Bomb Political Midterm News … Politics Gallego Weighs 2020 Senate Run, Confident About Primary Prospects PHOENIX — Rep. Ruben Gallego is focused on helping Democrats win in Arizona in 2018, but he’s also weighing a Senate run of his own in two years time. And he’s confident he would win a Democratic primary. The Arizona Democrat has previously said he is considering a run for the 2020 special election for the last two years of the late Republican Sen. John McCain’s term. Former GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed to McCain’s seat, but he has said he plans to step down at the end of the year. “At the end of the day, I think we’re going to make a determination based on: Can we win? And can we make a difference for Arizona?” Gallego said in an interview here at a local coffee shop Tuesday morning. “And that’s it. I’m not really worried about a primary.” The two-term congressman from the 7th District was confident he could defeat Grant Woods, McCain’s former chief of staff and onetime state attorney general. Woods has said he is considering switching parties to run as a Democrat or independent. “Grant Woods cannot win a Democratic primary in Arizona. So he can make his own determination, and I will just make my own in my own time,” Gallego said. “And we’ll go to a race, and I’ll defeat him and that will be that.” “He was [co-]chairman of Gov. [Jan] Brewer’s re-election campaign after SB 1070,” the congressman added, referring to the state’s controversial 2010 immigration law. “That’s not going to fly with Democrats” Watch: Fiery Arizona Debate in 4 Minutes Gallego said his decision will also hinge on whether Democrats win back the House in November, citing the possibility that he could become the next chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He also said he had to consider how to balance a Senate run with caring for his young son. Another factor in his decision to run? The outcome of this year’s competitive Senate race that features two House colleagues — Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally — for retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. “It’s difficult winning statewide here. And luckily you have a great example in how Sinema is being competitive about it,” Gallego said. “I would probably have to look strongly about [it]. There’s no guarantee that I would win.” Gallego, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, was first elected in 2014, winning a competitive Democratic primary for his Phoenix-area seat. He has been among the Democrats critical of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan for leader two years ago. Pelosi has opened the door to a short-term speakership should Democrats win back the House. Asked if that would be acceptable to anti-Pelosi Democrats, Gallego said, “I think she needs to first focus on making sure the Democrats win before she starts coming up with her platform and how she wants to transfer her power because she doesn’t have the power of speakership right now.” Any discussions about who could lead the House Democrats in the next Congress should wait until after the election, according to Gallego. “Anything before that is totally inappropriate, on her part or anybody else’s part,” he said.

Citing a dementia diagnosis that would most likely progress to Alzheimer’s disease, the 88-year-old said she was “no longer able to participate in public life,” something that defined her career. In making her announcement, O’Connor reminded the nation that the high court, on which she served from 1981 to 2006, was bookended by public service as not only a judge but as an accomplished state legislator and as a senior judge and elder stateswoman on political engagement through her founding of the group iCivics. “Not long after I retired from the Supreme Court twelve years ago, I made a commitment to myself, my family, and my country that I would use whatever years I had left to advance civic learning and engagement. I feel so strongly about the topic because I’ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government, and participate actively in their communities,” she wrote in the letter announcing her decision on Tuesday. The confirmation fight of the newest justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a bitter partisan fight that partially centered on whether, given his background in the George W. Bush White House and his work for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, he could be an impartial jurist given his history in politics. But O’Connor showed that a political career need not necessarily taint a jurist’s. In 1969, she was appointed to an Arizona state Senate seat, then won election to it outright in 1970. She went on to become majority leader, another first for a woman in the Legislature, before opting to run for election to a local judgeship. That set her along the path that would lead to President Ronald Reagan making her the first woman on the high court. After her retirement from Supreme Court, she continued to hear cases as many retired justices do, in the federal court system, all the while starting iCivics and taking care of her husband John Jay O’Connor III, who died in 2009 of Alzheimer’s disease. Chief Justice John Roberts had that civic legacy in mind in his response to the news. “I was saddened to learn that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, like many Americans, faces the challenge of dementia. But I was not at all surprised that she used the occasion of sharing that fact to think of our country first, and to urge an increased commitment to civics education, a cause to which she devoted so much of her time and indomitable energy,” Roberts wrote in a statement released by the Supreme Court. It is fitting that O’Connor’s announcement comes the same day the legacy institution of another Arizona icon, the late Sen. John McCain, announced an initiative to encourage civic participation, voting and respect for human rights. The McCain Institute’s “Mavericks Needed” campaign will run an ad through Election Day and then start a second campaign to last through 2020. “Now more than ever, America needs a new generation of Mavericks to stand up, speak out, serve causes greater than themselves, get in the area and vote on November 6th,” McCain’s widow Cindy, said in a statement. Cindy McCain was elected chairwoman of the McCain Institute last week. The two Arizonans, both of whom came to Washington in the early 1980s, leave the stage but with instructions on what to do in their absences.

Policy Rob Portman’s Report on Trump Trade Policy to Feature Mixed Results A key Republican senator sees positive signs in the Trump administration’s trade discussions with Canada and Mexico, but he still has plenty of criticism for the White House, too. In a major trade policy speech at the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday morning, Sen. Rob Portman is planning to focus on the effects of the Trump trade agenda on the auto industry, a key business in his manufacturing-heavy home state of Ohio. “I’m still reviewing the details of the updated NAFTA agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but I am encouraged by what I’ve seen so far,” Portman, a former U.S. trade representative, is expected to say. “One of the most substantial changes to NAFTA is the rules of origin for automobiles. In the time since NAFTA was ratified 24 years ago, the United States has lost about 350,000 auto jobs, while Mexico gained 430,000.” Portman’s indications of support of that framework is in contrast with his view of what the Commerce Department has done with using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose tariffs, even on close allies, using a nebulous “national security” justification. In his remarks, Portman is expected to speak to the proposal, which has been stalled in the Senate, to rework the trade law to restrict it to true national security implications. “The administration has used Section 232 to impose a new 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports worldwide,” the Ohio senator is expected to say. “For certain countries and certain products, I believe there is a national security issue with steel — including electrical steel, which is critical to the grid. But broadly imposing tariffs on our allies risks them retaliating by putting tariffs on our products.” “Simply put, auto and auto part imports are not a national security threat, and as I’ve been saying for months, these tariffs are a bad idea,” reads a copy of Portman’s prepared speech, which was obtained by Roll Call. Portman will outline views more favorable to Trump and the harder line of his administration when it comes to trade with China, citing Chinese policies such as requirements for joint ventures for U.S. automakers to do business in the communist country. The speech is expected to include a degree of support for the tariff announcements as part of negotiations with China. “While I do have concerns about some of the collateral damage these tariffs can do to folks trying to make products in America, I think this assertiveness on China is needed,” Portman is scheduled to say. “Republican and Democrat administrations alike have tried to get China’s attention on the trade issue and failed. China has been violating and circumventing our trade laws for decades. I think the Trump administration now has China’s attention, and I applaud the president for taking a tough stand.” But Portman is also expected to say that he does not view shortcuts like the purchase of additional soybeans from American producers by China as a solution to the trade issues between the two countries. “Instead, the United States should push for structural changes to the Chinese economy to reduce the ways Beijing distorts the economy in its favor and tilts the playing field away from American workers,” Portman is scheduled to tell the Heritage audience.

The Monster in the Budget Politics The Last of the Gingrich Revolutionaries It was nearly 24 years ago that Republicans swept into power in stunning fashion, ending 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. But those 73 new Republicans who came to the House and 11 who came to the Senate on the 1994 wave engineered by Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America” have now dwindled down to a handful, and after this election only seven will likely be left in Congress. For his part, Gingrich, a supporter of President Donald Trump, doesn’t see this as the end of an era, but a continuation of a revolution that began in 1964, with presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator. “I think we were the natural evolution that went Goldwater, Reagan, ’94 Contract, Trump,” he said. “I think there’s a very natural evolution of those things.” Two members of the Class of 1994 are retiring this year: New Jersey Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. In January, the two likely remaining continuously serving GOP House members will be Reps. Mac Thornberry of Texas and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the latter of whom has said the 2018 election will be his last. Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, another 1994 alum, lost in 2008, but won back his seat two years later in a rematch. Thornberry and Jones are both in races rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Chabot, however, faces a competitive re-election against Democrat Aftab Pureval in the 1st District, which Inside Elections rates Leans Republican. Three current Republican senators started their careers in the House in 1995: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma has served continuously in the Senate since 1995. Of the four, Wicker is the only one up for re-election this year, bidding for a second full Senate term. Inside Elections rates his race against Democrat David Baria, the state House minority leader, Solid Republican. Burr won a third Senate term two years ago after announcing it would be his last. Back in 2014, Gingrich lamented what had become of his caucus. At a reunion of the Class of 1994, he said, “The fact that we do not have positive themes and positive issues is going to cost us seats this fall.” As it turned out, Republicans picked up 13 seats in the House that year and retook control of the Senate.

Politics For Trump, Pipe Bombs Sent to Opponents Is Ploy to Halt GOP ‘Momentum’ Before Midterms For President Donald Trump, the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats this week appear to only be about spoiling a Republican Party on cruise control. That was the president’s message on Friday, when he said media outlets are covering a string of mail bombs sent to leading Democrats and CNN to distract voters from an election cycle he believes favor Republicans. “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,” he said in a tweet. By putting the word “bomb” in quotation marks, the president appeared to question whether the devices, which federal experts say were not capable of exploding, meet the definition of a bomb. As Election Day has neared, the forecast for the midterms has tightened, with Democrats still favored to win a majority in the House, with the number of projected pickups fluctuating and a Senate dynamic continuing to show multiple GOP routes to holding the majority in that chamber. The Trump midterm campaign message has focused largely on firing up his base to drive up conservative voter turnout in key states and districts with competitive House and Senate races. He used the attempted bombings to continue that strategy. “Very unfortunate, what is going on,” he said of the bomb drama and nationwide manhunt. “Republicans, go out and vote!” Packages, all mailed in manila envelopes with Forever stamps, were sent to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, actor Robert DeNiro, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Rep. Maxine Waters of California. CNN’s New York offices were evacuated Tuesday when that outlet got a mail bomb addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan. The count jumped again on Friday, with suspicious packages addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. All have been sharply criticized by the president. But his top aides reject that he has any responsibility and say his often bleak and derisive rhetoric has nothing to do with the violent background developing.

Keith Ellison Trailing in New Poll for Minnesota Attorney General Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Keeps Even Partisan Split Just How Average Are the Average Voters in Campaign Ads?  ‘Congress Too’ Founders Launch Fundraising Effort for Fired Pregnant Staffer Bernie Sanders Blasts Donald Trump for Weakness in ‘Taking on the Dictator of Saudi Arabia’ Spartacus, Apprenticeships and a Cat Watching C-SPAN: Congressional Hits and Misses No One — Not Even Republicans — Likes Congress What Will Happen if Democrats Win Opinion A Traitor to the Pundit Class, I Enter the No-Predictions Zone OPINION — To watch the World Series or the baseball playoffs is an invitation to enter the realm of the irrelevant statistic. When the Red Sox pushed across their first run in the first inning Monday night, a Fox announcer burbled that Boston also scored in the first inning of the opening game when they won the Series in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Of course, no players from 2004 and 2007 are on the active Red Sox roster — and scoring in the second or fifth inning can also be an effective way of winning a ballgame. Highlighted on the screen every night are the postseason stats of the players, even though the Dodgers, for example, played just 11 games to advance to the World Series. Virtually invisible during the telecasts are what the players accomplished during the full 162-game season, even though these numbers have infinitely more predictive value. Those of us who closely follow politics can easily feel superior to the statistical naïfs in the World Series broadcast booth. But often we fall into a similar trap — the arrogant belief that the future is knowable if you crunch enough numbers. The 2018 midterms have brought a new level of sophistication to political analysis. The New York Times in conjunction with Siena College has completed more than 60 congressional polls with the real-time results flashed on the computer screen with each call. Polling analysts like Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight have honed their predictive models. And traditional race-by-race handicappers like Nathan Gonzales, Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball do an exemplary job on the granular level. Yet, even after hearing cautionary words about polling and polling analysis, we tend to overreact to every statistical gyration. A Rutgers-Eagleton Senate poll from New Jersey, released Wednesday, shows scandal-scarred Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez up by just 5 points in a state that Hillary Clinton carried by 14 points. Is the race tightening? Could Democrats blow a seemingly safe seat? Or is the poll just a margin-of-error quirk? Multiply this reaction by nearly 500 contested races for Congress and governor, and you have a rough sense of the stress levels on both sides less than 300 hours before the polls open on Election Day. The truth is that all the polling in the world cannot prepare you for a midterm election with this broad a terrain. And there are many hard-fought House races, like in Maine’s 2nd District, where there have only been a handful of reputable polls. Sure, broad questions like the generic ballot (“Do you prefer a Congress controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans?”) can offer national clues. But is the Democrats’ current 8-point average edge on this question enough to comfortably overcome the GOP-leaning effects of incumbency and gerrymandering in the House? A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll of 69 hotly contested House districts found the two parties effectively tied. But is this good news for the Republicans because they are holding their own in battleground races? Or is this a formula for a Democratic sweep since more than 90 percent of the districts surveyed are currently GOP held? Knotty questions like these can make political pundits sound like medieval theologians debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. At a certain level there are no hard truths about the 2018 elections yet — only personal tendencies towards optimism or pessimism. After enduring Election Night 2016, many Democrats are like battered children brooding that once again victory (this time, winning the House) will be snatched from their grasp. Similarly, there are Republicans who believe that Donald Trump will help them defy the polls, while other GOP strategists privately worry that a president with no impulse control is leading them to political doom. For all the twitchiness of the political class, it is also worth remembering that the prevalence of early voting in many states cuts into the ability of a single late-breaking event to reshape the midterms. Already, in early-voting states, we are approaching the point when it is too late to effectively drop opposition research. Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States Sometimes politics is simply perverse. This is not a reference to the Trump triumph in 2016, but rather to an earlier midterm election that should serve as a cautionary tale for all those eager to make glib predictions. In 1986, the Democrats won seven Senate seats by a collective margin of 98,000 votes. Those 98,000 votes were the difference between a 55-45 Democratic Senate and one that was controlled by the GOP. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill said triumphantly after the election, “If there was a Reagan revolution, it’s over.” In the 1960s, an ad campaign for Schlitz, a century-old Milwaukee beer, featured the tagline, “You only go around once in life — go for all the gusto you can.” In elections, as well, you only go around once. So it doesn’t matter that in some alternate universe Hillary Clinton is president and the Republicans held the Senate for Ronald Reagan in 1986. Whatever happens on Nov. 6 will seem foreordained by the gods, but in truth, it will be just one of dozens of equally plausible outcomes. What four decades covering politics has taught me more than anything is humility. Neither I nor anyone practicing punditry on cable TV has the gift of prophesy. But, if I had to guess, I would say that the election comes down to how voters sort out the three dominant fundamentals: A booming economy, albeit with a suddenly shaky stock market. A president who violates every rule of decency with his incessant fearmongering and vicious attacks. And a Democratic Party able to aggressively compete across a broad swatch of GOP-held House districts while grappling with a Senate map wildly tilted toward the Republicans. Beyond that, I will be a traitor to the pundit class as I dispense with glib predictions. Instead, I will bow toward the unknowable as I breathlessly wait until the returns come in on Election Night.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Kyrsten Sinema is trying to do something that no Arizona Democrat has done in 30 years: win a Senate election. “We know we can win this election,” the three-term congresswoman told supporters packed into a union hall here Sunday. “This year, the votes in the Senate matter.” And unlike Democrats in other red or purple states from Texas to Georgia who are running on decidedly progressive platforms, she’s making her case as a moderate with appeal to independents and pragmatic Republicans as she takes on GOP Rep. Martha McSally. If Democrats have any hope of taking back the Senate or mitigating potential losses in red states, they need to win Arizona. But to do that, Sinema will also need to turn out the party faithful in high numbers. It’s a delicate balancing act that few Democrats have been able to accomplish in Arizona in recent years — it’s been a decade since the party last won a statewide race. “Midterms are hard [for Democrats] to win in Arizona, which tells you why Sinema is such a phenomenon, that she’s even keeping it close,” Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said in an interview at a Phoenix coffee shop. Democrats believe the state is trending in their direction, but it’s not clear if Sinema’s strategy will be enough to win this year. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. Recent polls have shown Sinema’s once small, but steady, lead nearly evaporate, with McSally even inching ahead in some surveys. And a loss could have Democrats rethinking how they win a state like Arizona. Also Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange Sinema does have a math problem. Republicans and those not registered with a party still outnumber registered Democrats in the Grand Canyon State. That partisan divide makes some Democrats nervous. Karen Lieneke, a 65-year-old English as a second language teacher in Tucson, said she was “cautiously optimistic” that Sinema could actually win. “The climate of fear and the climate of really raw politics is a wild card to me,” Lieneke said at the union hall. Sinema, a former state legislator, has been helped by an aggressive ad campaign touting herself as a moderate and an independent lawmaker. She was on television as early as April, and went largely unchallenged on the airwaves as McSally battled two others in a competitive GOP primary. Democrats say Arizonans recognize that the once self-described “most liberal legislator in the state” has shifted to the center since first coming to Congress in 2012. In a recent radio interview, Sinema said it was difficult to call herself a proud Democrat, opting instead to call herself a “proud Arizonan.” She has acknowledged her ideological shift — an analysis by CQ Vote Watch found she supported the president’s priorities 60 percent of the time, the third-highest score among House Democrats. “Over the years I am proud to say I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally change my opinion,” she said at a recent debate. But Republicans are trying to paint Sinema as a radical liberal, and highlighting past footage of her knocking the Grand Canyon State. “You guys haven’t reported on Sinema calling our state crazy and saying we’re the meth lab for democracy,” McSally chided reporters after touring a technical school in Avondale on Wednesday. “Every single day something is coming out related to her campaign that’s actually legit, her showing disdain for our state.” The National Republican Senatorial Committee in a recent television ad used video of Sinema implying in 2011 that Arizona produces “crazy,” but the tactic might not work with everyone. Dorothy Byrne, a 77-year-old Phoenix resident not registered with any party, is backing Sinema this year (and all Democrats to protest what she sees as a divisive GOP-controlled government). “Tell us what you want to do today,” Byrne said Monday while waiting to hear Democrat Hiral Tipirneni address a town hall meeting in Arizona’s 8th District. “I don’t care what you did 20 years ago. I didn’t do the same things 20 years ago.” Byrne supported GOP Sen. John McCain in 2016, but wasn’t inclined to support McSally this year. “We need things back a little more in balance,” she said. Democrats see a path to victory with the support of nonpartisan voters like Byrne and moderate Republican women. But Sinema also has to make sure that moderate image doesn’t turn off loyal party members, whom she also needs to turn out in large numbers. Arizona may not yet be a blue state, but it isn’t as red as it used to be. President Donald Trump won it by 4 points in 2016, smaller than his margin in the traditional swing state of Ohio. Democrats supporting Sinema packed two union halls Sunday as she traveled from Tucson to Phoenix to stress the importance of voting early. Not everyone in the room was thrilled with her moderate positions, but they still showed up. “I agree with the president essentially never,” Emily Dacey, 31, said at the Phoenix event, adding that she wished Sinema would be more adamantly opposed to Trump. “But I’m not getting to choose my ideal person,” Dacey said. “I’m getting to choose between Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally. And I’m here to fight for her because she still stands more with me than McSally does.” Democrats are touting an extensive field operation as evidence of energy on the left. The joint effort between the Arizona Democratic Party and Sinema’s campaign boasts 25 field offices and 4,000 volunteers across the state. Over the weekend, volunteers knocked on 65,000 doors, the most ever in one weekend, according to Sinema’s campaign. Gallego said there was a focus on getting out the vote this year and that turning out Latino and Native American voters were key to a Democratic victory. But so far, early ballot returns give Republicans an edge. As of Wednesday evening, 44 percent of the early ballot returns were from Republicans, while 33 percent were from Democrats. Gallego, who is weighing a Senate run of his own in 2020, said future efforts may have to concentrate more on turning out the Democratic base. He said an emphasis on voter registration could close the gap as the state shifts demographically with its growing cities. “Arizona’s changing. It just is,” said DJ Quinlan, the former executive director of the state Democratic Party. “The notion that Arizona is this bright red state is no longer accurate. It’s going to be a swing state from this point forward” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Opinion One Person, One Vote. Is It That Complicated? OPINION — I admit that voting is and has always been a celebratory ritual for me, even if the candidate is running unopposed, the office is state agriculture commissioner or my district’s makeup means my one vote won’t make much of a difference. I watched three older siblings march for civil rights, and I am well aware that many brave folks died protecting my right to cast that ballot. While a little rain or a busy schedule might provide an excuse to “sit this one out,” it’s never enough to outweigh the legacy left by a Medgar Evers, who served his country in World War II and was murdered in front of his Mississippi home for, among other civil rights activity, leading voter registration drives in the country he protected. Mine is not a controversial stand — in fact, it’s patriotic. You would think our country’s leaders, without regard to party or politics, would be on my side. You would be wrong. When Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 wrote the majority opinion gutting key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — those that compelled certain states to “preclear” any changes in their voting rules — he insisted that so much had changed in the country that those rules were no longer needed. “The Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Racism is dead, or on its last legs, he seemed to declare. I would not call Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent cynical. It was realistic. As she wrote: “As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abundantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as attempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that originally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.” What Year Is It? Trump’s Midterm Rallies Are Mostly About His 2020 Re-Election Bid In a perfect country, politicians would rejoice at the chance to win the hearts and minds of constituents with strong policies, to show how inclusive their party’s big tent could be. But we are not living in Oz, no matter how much the judges who joined Roberts in the majority decision might have wished. As Ginsburg predicted, the poll taxes, literary tests and lynchings may have disappeared. But the intent remained in full force. The 2013 Shelby County v. Holder ruling was a green light for the shenanigans the federal government once prevented states from pulling. Moving of polling places. Strict ID restrictions targeting minorities, the poor, the elderly and the young. Same-day registrations that made voting easier for those working two and three job. Purges of voting lists. The list was limited only by the imaginations of those making it. And boy, did the folks who wanted to choose their voters, instead of letting their voters choose them, have great imaginations. These new tactics are in bold view in the midterm elections of 2018, with states still mired in lawsuits over restrictions legislators have justified as a fight against that boogeyman, voter fraud, which every study has proved insignificant. In North Dakota, the votes of the original Americans, Native Americans, have been disproportionately jeopardized by a ruling that says a street address rather than a post office box on registrations is required in that sparsely populated state. In North Carolina, a voter ID bill that has been thrown out by the courts for targeting minority voters with “almost surgical precision” may yet rise from the dead if an amendment to the state’s constitution passes. Georgia is in a category all by itself. Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, has refused to recuse himself from his day job of secretary of state, which puts him in charge of overseeing elections, including his own. Cozy, wouldn’t you say? Even GOP secretary of state and Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, the king of efforts to suppress the vote to fight hordes of supposed illegal voters, has passed his election duties over to a deputy. Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first African-American woman elected governor in this country. What some see as evidence of how far America has come, others see as reason for a second civil war, this time on voting rights. Georgia election officials have been accused of tossing out a disproportionate number of absentee ballots from minority voters, and holding up close to 53,000 voter registrations because they do not satisfy a controversial “exact match” requirement with all other government documents. (An errant hyphen or period might be the culprit.) A county official kicked black senior citizens off a bus that was heading to the polls, as if those senior citizens had not already heard enough government officials tell them “no.” What side is the president on? “All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING,” Trump tweeted. “Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!” Not exactly an invitation — more like a warning and a threat. It’s no surprise from a president who insisted the 3 million votes that gave Hillary Clinton a popular vote win in 2016 were the result of illegal voters and fraud. His administration’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, with Kobach front and center, charged with tracking down those voters, I suspect was disbanded for lack of evidence and because state election officials turned their bipartisan backs on requests for intrusive voting records. The integrity and the results of the elections coming up in two weeks could be called into question because of the fruits of that Supreme Court decision. The country is facing the prospect of having an election with results that few trust, to be decided at a later date. All these conflicts will have repercussions long after the midterms — resentments and accusations and an America more divided than ever, sowing more distrust in institutions, this time not law enforcement or the media, but democracy itself. I wish, for his family and our country’s sake, that Medgar Evers were alive, though his spirit and resolve live on in the work of many. There is still so much work to do. Mary C.

Politics The Coincidence of Bomb Recipients, Trump and Far-Right Rhetoric ANALYSIS | The recipients of explosive devices sent this week have so far shared a commonality: harsh criticism by President Donald Trump and far-right followers. But White House officials were in no mood Wednesday to entertain the notion that the president’s descriptions of Democrats as “evil” and news organizations as the “enemy of the people” might have helped lead a bomber to build devices and mail them to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and CNN. A building in Miami that houses an office for former Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also evacuated Wednesday. Trump’s aides declined to comment beyond a statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning what she called “attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures.” “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” Sanders said. Vice President Mike Pence later tweeted his condemnation of the attempted bombings; Trump tweeted this agreement. I agree wholeheartedly! https://t.co/ndzu0A30vU  [Suspicious Package Cases Grow, Debbie Wasserman Schultz First Known Congressional Target] But the matter has one glaring common denominator: Trump’s sharp rhetoric about each recipient and a highly partisan midterm election that has only deepened a widely divided country’s tribal wounds. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” chanted a rally crowd Monday night in Houston, where Trump was firing up the base as he and Sen. Ted Cruz tried to keep the senator’s seat in Republican hands. Trump pivoted from one topic to the next in the manner that defines his raucous stream-of-consciousness rallies, heading straight toward a line sure to ignite the Toyota Center crowd: “If you want the fake news to finally investigate Hillary Clinton, we’ll just have…” That’s when the familiar chant broke out. “Man,” an impressed Trump said before trying to pass off any responsibility: “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.” But if the president was concerned his constant calls for his former political foe to face a federal investigation, it certainly didn’t stop him. “So if you want them to investigate, we’ll just have to nominate Hillary Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. How do you like that?” he said as the crowd booed loudly. “Right? Let’s see how she does. If [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh had to go through what he went through ... can you imagine Hillary up there? That would take three to four years of questions.” His supporters laughed in unison. Trump used the line about Clinton to move into his ramped-up rhetoric about all Democrats, saying the midterms are all about preventing “the radical Democrat mob” from taking “a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country and our economy.” Monday night’s rally alone featured multiple sharp attacks on Democrats as the president eagerly accuses the opposition party of being the “party of crime” that wants to allow undocumented migrants pour over the U.S.-Mexico border to flood the country with crime and drugs while raising taxes and ending programs like Social Security and Medicaid. He blasted Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke for voting for what he called “Obama amnesty.” Trump told the crowd in Houston that Immigration and Border Control officers are fighting “a war” against undocumented individuals — and he essentially told them to blame Obama. “They go in and they take them and they throw them into the paddy wagon, then get them the hell out of our country. We’ve removed thousands, thousands of them. They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people,” he said. “And the towns are liberated. ... I’m telling you, it’s like a war.” Watching a single “Make America Great Again” rally shows how the president’s supporters direct their ire at his political foes, especially Clinton and CNN. A mere mention of the “fake news media” elicited an unprompted chant in Houston: “CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!” “I don’t like them either, OK?” Trump said. Trump is slated to lead rallies Wednesday night in Wisconsin, Friday night in North Carolina and Saturday in Illinois. White House officials gave no indication that he is considering canceling one or all in an attempt to cool down the country’s white-hot political climate. Sanders did not respond to an email asking whether Trump is concerned his words might have played a role in the bomber’s mindset, and if he might cancel one or all of those rallies. Wasserman-Schultz has been a target of Trump’s rhetoric for several years, with her stint at the DNC putting her on his radar. As the 2016 general election was about to heat up, Trump fired off this tweet: “The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she’s out!” [Trump’s Tax Cut Gambit Gets Heads Scratching] Then there’s Soros. Trump on Oct. 5 lashed out at Soros in a tweet, blaming him for financing left-wing protesters who lined Capitol Hill hallways and Washington streets objecting to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!” the president tweeted, adding this hashtag: “#Troublemakers.” The president has also floated the idea, without evidence, that Democrats are financing a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico and heading for the U.S. border. “It was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,” Pence said Monday in the Oval Office before being interrupted by his boss. “And the Democrats, maybe? And the Democrats?” Trump asked with a chuckle. “Well,” Pence started to say before he was cut off. CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked Trump for proof of the Democrat’s involvement. “You know what? You’re going to find out, and we’re going to see,” he said, again offering no evidence. The list of targets grew as did the glare of their shared commonality. Sanders responded with a second statement around midday Wednesday, this time via Twitter. “Our condemnation of these dispicable [sic] acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of explosive devices mailed to the news network and several prominent Democratic politicians and donors. “These cowardly acts are unacceptable and wont be tolerated.” This is an ongoing situation that President Trump and his admin are monitoring closely.

Martha McSally continues to face criticism for her vote to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act, and engaged in a heated exchange with a local reporter over protections for people with pre-existing conditions after an event Wednesday. “I have fought for pre-existing conditions. I voted to protect pre-existing conditions. This is personal,” the Arizona Republican told reporters after touring the Universal Technical Institute. Brahm Resnik of the Phoenix NBC affiliate interjected, noting the GOP measure to repeal the 2010 health care law would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange “It’s not true. It’s not true. Stop parroting Democratic talking points,” McSally said. “Health care is a complex issue. Right now it’s not working. Right now people with pre-existing conditions can’t get access to health care on the health insurance market or the individual insurance market because Obamacare has failed.” The GOP bill, known as the American Health Care Act, included a provision that prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. However, it also provided states an avenue to waive certain regulations, which could have allowed insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for coverage, potentially rendering health care unaffordable. McSally voted for the GOP bill, and reportedly told her Republican colleagues the day of the vote to get this “f---ing thing” done. McSally’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has made health care central to her campaign. The two lawmakers are competing in an open seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Sinema accused McSally in a tweet Wednesday of lying about her record in response to a new McSally television ad where she said she has worked to force insurance companies to protect people with pre-existing conditions. “Here’s the truth: I voted to protect coverage for the 2.8 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions,” Sinema tweeted. “Martha voted to take it away.” Inside Elections with Nathan L.

Politics NARAL Launches Final Push to Fire Up Abortion Rights Voters With voters already casting ballots in states that allow early voting, outside advocacy groups are not just trying to reach potential new voters — they’re working to make sure their most ardent supporters actually show up. That is certainly the case with NARAL, which is announcing a final push to make sure that the abortion rights group’s supporters get out to vote in 2018. The organization is launching a new $750,000 campaign that will feature direct mail and digital advertising geared toward supporters in 17 key races as the campaign cycle nears its end. According to a listing provided to Roll Call ahead of formal release, the mailers are being directed to Senate contests in Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada and Wisconsin. According to a summary of the plan for the final weeks, which was provided first to Roll Call, the House races involved include key seats in Arizona, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. NARAL is also targeting the governor’s races in Iowa, New Mexico and Nevada. NARAL is trying to make sure that the group’s core supporters, many of whom were recently even more engaged over the Senate confirmation process of Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, actually make it to the polls (either through early voting where it’s possible or on Election Day). “Based on the energy we are seeing from voters across the country, we’re supercharging our program to move voters to elect pro-choice champions.The stakes have never been higher,” said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue. “The threat to Roe v. Wade is real and on the horizon.” “Women are fired up and ready to elect candidates in their communities who support us and our families. Our job is to reach as many of them as possible in the next two weeks,” Hogue said. In addition to a national umbrella digital ad, the group’s produced several for individual candidates, including Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The direct mail and new round of digital ads in many of the same jurisdictions are beyond $5 million in midterm-related spending already, including a previously announced $1 million for TV and digital ads and $750,000 for an earlier campaign effort.

Politics GOP Ads Target Young Female Voters on Violence Against Women Act An outside group dedicated to electing Republican women is launching digital ads urging three lawmakers to support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire in December. The digital ads, obtained first by Roll Call, target Reps. Mimi Walters of California and Barbara Comstock of Virginia — both facing tough re-elections — and Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, who’s running for Senate. All three are being challenged by Democratic women. In a year that’s seen high enthusiasm among female voters for Democratic candidates, especially in suburban districts, these issue ads try to highlight GOP lawmakers’ advocacy for women. Republicans are at risk of seeing the number of women in their House conference decline next year. Running on Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Hulu, the ads are targeted to younger women, softer Republican voters and independents, and are backed by a six-figure digital buy across the three states. The ads are part of the MyRoar campaign, which is paid for by Winning for Women. The group’s PAC has endorsed all three women, who are also identified as “Lionesses” on the MyRoar website. One version of the ad begins by explaining the Violence Against Women Act. “What if there was a law that provided defense for victims of sexual assault?” the narrator asks. “Well that law expires in just months,” the narrator continues. “But what if I told you you could help the efforts of women like Congresswoman Barbara Comstock to keep it alive when Congress returns?” “What if I told you that you could be heard?” the narrator says, as the face of a young woman appears on screen. Another version of the ad opens with statistics about rape and sexual assault and the percentage of the offenders who see jail time. Things would be “a lot worse” without the Violence Against Women Act, the narrator says. “Congresswoman Mimi Walters has been working hard for women. Learn how to help Mimi keep working to pass a bigger, better Violence Against Women Act when Congress returns,” the narrator says. The Violence Against Women Act was supposed to expire on Sept. 30, but it was extended under a stopgap spending bill in September. Led by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats have introduced legislation to reauthorize the law with updates, including a provision that would prohibit those under protective order from possessing firearms. No Republicans have signed on to the Democratic proposal. Flashback: Democrats Hope to Extend Violence Against Women Act GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and John J. Faso of New York and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced their own six-month reauthorization legislation in September. Walters is listed as a co-sponsor on that measure. Comstock and McSally are not. Forty-six Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last month asking for urgent action to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act before its Sept. 30 expiration. Comstock and Walters signed on to that letter. McSally did not. “In Congress, all three of these women have a strong track record of supporting legislation that promotes and empowers women. Each is a warrior. And we look forward to their continued commitment to the Violence Against Women Act and to victims of violence and sexual assault across the country,” Winning For Women Executive Director Rebecca Schuller said in a statement.

Meanwhile, in Non-Pipe Bomb Political Midterm News … Politics Gallego Weighs 2020 Senate Run, Confident About Primary Prospects PHOENIX — Rep. Ruben Gallego is focused on helping Democrats win in Arizona in 2018, but he’s also weighing a Senate run of his own in two years time. And he’s confident he would win a Democratic primary. The Arizona Democrat has previously said he is considering a run for the 2020 special election for the last two years of the late Republican Sen. John McCain’s term. Former GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed to McCain’s seat, but he has said he plans to step down at the end of the year. “At the end of the day, I think we’re going to make a determination based on: Can we win? And can we make a difference for Arizona?” Gallego said in an interview here at a local coffee shop Tuesday morning. “And that’s it. I’m not really worried about a primary.” The two-term congressman from the 7th District was confident he could defeat Grant Woods, McCain’s former chief of staff and onetime state attorney general. Woods has said he is considering switching parties to run as a Democrat or independent. “Grant Woods cannot win a Democratic primary in Arizona. So he can make his own determination, and I will just make my own in my own time,” Gallego said. “And we’ll go to a race, and I’ll defeat him and that will be that.” “He was [co-]chairman of Gov. [Jan] Brewer’s re-election campaign after SB 1070,” the congressman added, referring to the state’s controversial 2010 immigration law. “That’s not going to fly with Democrats” Watch: Fiery Arizona Debate in 4 Minutes Gallego said his decision will also hinge on whether Democrats win back the House in November, citing the possibility that he could become the next chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He also said he had to consider how to balance a Senate run with caring for his young son. Another factor in his decision to run? The outcome of this year’s competitive Senate race that features two House colleagues — Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally — for retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. “It’s difficult winning statewide here. And luckily you have a great example in how Sinema is being competitive about it,” Gallego said. “I would probably have to look strongly about [it]. There’s no guarantee that I would win.” Gallego, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, was first elected in 2014, winning a competitive Democratic primary for his Phoenix-area seat. He has been among the Democrats critical of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan for leader two years ago. Pelosi has opened the door to a short-term speakership should Democrats win back the House. Asked if that would be acceptable to anti-Pelosi Democrats, Gallego said, “I think she needs to first focus on making sure the Democrats win before she starts coming up with her platform and how she wants to transfer her power because she doesn’t have the power of speakership right now.” Any discussions about who could lead the House Democrats in the next Congress should wait until after the election, according to Gallego. “Anything before that is totally inappropriate, on her part or anybody else’s part,” he said.

Citing a dementia diagnosis that would most likely progress to Alzheimer’s disease, the 88-year-old said she was “no longer able to participate in public life,” something that defined her career. In making her announcement, O’Connor reminded the nation that the high court, on which she served from 1981 to 2006, was bookended by public service as not only a judge but as an accomplished state legislator and as a senior judge and elder stateswoman on political engagement through her founding of the group iCivics. “Not long after I retired from the Supreme Court twelve years ago, I made a commitment to myself, my family, and my country that I would use whatever years I had left to advance civic learning and engagement. I feel so strongly about the topic because I’ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government, and participate actively in their communities,” she wrote in the letter announcing her decision on Tuesday. The confirmation fight of the newest justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a bitter partisan fight that partially centered on whether, given his background in the George W. Bush White House and his work for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, he could be an impartial jurist given his history in politics. But O’Connor showed that a political career need not necessarily taint a jurist’s. In 1969, she was appointed to an Arizona state Senate seat, then won election to it outright in 1970. She went on to become majority leader, another first for a woman in the Legislature, before opting to run for election to a local judgeship. That set her along the path that would lead to President Ronald Reagan making her the first woman on the high court. After her retirement from Supreme Court, she continued to hear cases as many retired justices do, in the federal court system, all the while starting iCivics and taking care of her husband John Jay O’Connor III, who died in 2009 of Alzheimer’s disease. Chief Justice John Roberts had that civic legacy in mind in his response to the news. “I was saddened to learn that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, like many Americans, faces the challenge of dementia. But I was not at all surprised that she used the occasion of sharing that fact to think of our country first, and to urge an increased commitment to civics education, a cause to which she devoted so much of her time and indomitable energy,” Roberts wrote in a statement released by the Supreme Court. It is fitting that O’Connor’s announcement comes the same day the legacy institution of another Arizona icon, the late Sen. John McCain, announced an initiative to encourage civic participation, voting and respect for human rights. The McCain Institute’s “Mavericks Needed” campaign will run an ad through Election Day and then start a second campaign to last through 2020. “Now more than ever, America needs a new generation of Mavericks to stand up, speak out, serve causes greater than themselves, get in the area and vote on November 6th,” McCain’s widow Cindy, said in a statement. Cindy McCain was elected chairwoman of the McCain Institute last week. The two Arizonans, both of whom came to Washington in the early 1980s, leave the stage but with instructions on what to do in their absences.

Policy Rob Portman’s Report on Trump Trade Policy to Feature Mixed Results A key Republican senator sees positive signs in the Trump administration’s trade discussions with Canada and Mexico, but he still has plenty of criticism for the White House, too. In a major trade policy speech at the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday morning, Sen. Rob Portman is planning to focus on the effects of the Trump trade agenda on the auto industry, a key business in his manufacturing-heavy home state of Ohio. “I’m still reviewing the details of the updated NAFTA agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but I am encouraged by what I’ve seen so far,” Portman, a former U.S. trade representative, is expected to say. “One of the most substantial changes to NAFTA is the rules of origin for automobiles. In the time since NAFTA was ratified 24 years ago, the United States has lost about 350,000 auto jobs, while Mexico gained 430,000.” Portman’s indications of support of that framework is in contrast with his view of what the Commerce Department has done with using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose tariffs, even on close allies, using a nebulous “national security” justification. In his remarks, Portman is expected to speak to the proposal, which has been stalled in the Senate, to rework the trade law to restrict it to true national security implications. “The administration has used Section 232 to impose a new 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports worldwide,” the Ohio senator is expected to say. “For certain countries and certain products, I believe there is a national security issue with steel — including electrical steel, which is critical to the grid. But broadly imposing tariffs on our allies risks them retaliating by putting tariffs on our products.” “Simply put, auto and auto part imports are not a national security threat, and as I’ve been saying for months, these tariffs are a bad idea,” reads a copy of Portman’s prepared speech, which was obtained by Roll Call. Portman will outline views more favorable to Trump and the harder line of his administration when it comes to trade with China, citing Chinese policies such as requirements for joint ventures for U.S. automakers to do business in the communist country. The speech is expected to include a degree of support for the tariff announcements as part of negotiations with China. “While I do have concerns about some of the collateral damage these tariffs can do to folks trying to make products in America, I think this assertiveness on China is needed,” Portman is scheduled to say. “Republican and Democrat administrations alike have tried to get China’s attention on the trade issue and failed. China has been violating and circumventing our trade laws for decades. I think the Trump administration now has China’s attention, and I applaud the president for taking a tough stand.” But Portman is also expected to say that he does not view shortcuts like the purchase of additional soybeans from American producers by China as a solution to the trade issues between the two countries. “Instead, the United States should push for structural changes to the Chinese economy to reduce the ways Beijing distorts the economy in its favor and tilts the playing field away from American workers,” Portman is scheduled to tell the Heritage audience.

The Monster in the Budget Politics The Last of the Gingrich Revolutionaries It was nearly 24 years ago that Republicans swept into power in stunning fashion, ending 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. But those 73 new Republicans who came to the House and 11 who came to the Senate on the 1994 wave engineered by Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America” have now dwindled down to a handful, and after this election only seven will likely be left in Congress. For his part, Gingrich, a supporter of President Donald Trump, doesn’t see this as the end of an era, but a continuation of a revolution that began in 1964, with presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator. “I think we were the natural evolution that went Goldwater, Reagan, ’94 Contract, Trump,” he said. “I think there’s a very natural evolution of those things.” Two members of the Class of 1994 are retiring this year: New Jersey Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. In January, the two likely remaining continuously serving GOP House members will be Reps. Mac Thornberry of Texas and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the latter of whom has said the 2018 election will be his last. Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, another 1994 alum, lost in 2008, but won back his seat two years later in a rematch. Thornberry and Jones are both in races rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Chabot, however, faces a competitive re-election against Democrat Aftab Pureval in the 1st District, which Inside Elections rates Leans Republican. Three current Republican senators started their careers in the House in 1995: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma has served continuously in the Senate since 1995. Of the four, Wicker is the only one up for re-election this year, bidding for a second full Senate term. Inside Elections rates his race against Democrat David Baria, the state House minority leader, Solid Republican. Burr won a third Senate term two years ago after announcing it would be his last. Back in 2014, Gingrich lamented what had become of his caucus. At a reunion of the Class of 1994, he said, “The fact that we do not have positive themes and positive issues is going to cost us seats this fall.” As it turned out, Republicans picked up 13 seats in the House that year and retook control of the Senate.

Politics For Trump, Pipe Bombs Sent to Opponents Is Ploy to Halt GOP ‘Momentum’ Before Midterms For President Donald Trump, the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats this week appear to only be about spoiling a Republican Party on cruise control. That was the president’s message on Friday, when he said media outlets are covering a string of mail bombs sent to leading Democrats and CNN to distract voters from an election cycle he believes favor Republicans. “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,” he said in a tweet. By putting the word “bomb” in quotation marks, the president appeared to question whether the devices, which federal experts say were not capable of exploding, meet the definition of a bomb. As Election Day has neared, the forecast for the midterms has tightened, with Democrats still favored to win a majority in the House, with the number of projected pickups fluctuating and a Senate dynamic continuing to show multiple GOP routes to holding the majority in that chamber. The Trump midterm campaign message has focused largely on firing up his base to drive up conservative voter turnout in key states and districts with competitive House and Senate races. He used the attempted bombings to continue that strategy. “Very unfortunate, what is going on,” he said of the bomb drama and nationwide manhunt. “Republicans, go out and vote!” Packages, all mailed in manila envelopes with Forever stamps, were sent to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, actor Robert DeNiro, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Rep. Maxine Waters of California. CNN’s New York offices were evacuated Tuesday when that outlet got a mail bomb addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan. The count jumped again on Friday, with suspicious packages addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. All have been sharply criticized by the president. But his top aides reject that he has any responsibility and say his often bleak and derisive rhetoric has nothing to do with the violent background developing.

Keith Ellison Trailing in New Poll for Minnesota Attorney General Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Keeps Even Partisan Split Just How Average Are the Average Voters in Campaign Ads?  ‘Congress Too’ Founders Launch Fundraising Effort for Fired Pregnant Staffer Bernie Sanders Blasts Donald Trump for Weakness in ‘Taking on the Dictator of Saudi Arabia’ Spartacus, Apprenticeships and a Cat Watching C-SPAN: Congressional Hits and Misses No One — Not Even Republicans — Likes Congress What Will Happen if Democrats Win Opinion A Traitor to the Pundit Class, I Enter the No-Predictions Zone OPINION — To watch the World Series or the baseball playoffs is an invitation to enter the realm of the irrelevant statistic. When the Red Sox pushed across their first run in the first inning Monday night, a Fox announcer burbled that Boston also scored in the first inning of the opening game when they won the Series in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Of course, no players from 2004 and 2007 are on the active Red Sox roster — and scoring in the second or fifth inning can also be an effective way of winning a ballgame. Highlighted on the screen every night are the postseason stats of the players, even though the Dodgers, for example, played just 11 games to advance to the World Series. Virtually invisible during the telecasts are what the players accomplished during the full 162-game season, even though these numbers have infinitely more predictive value. Those of us who closely follow politics can easily feel superior to the statistical naïfs in the World Series broadcast booth. But often we fall into a similar trap — the arrogant belief that the future is knowable if you crunch enough numbers. The 2018 midterms have brought a new level of sophistication to political analysis. The New York Times in conjunction with Siena College has completed more than 60 congressional polls with the real-time results flashed on the computer screen with each call. Polling analysts like Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight have honed their predictive models. And traditional race-by-race handicappers like Nathan Gonzales, Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball do an exemplary job on the granular level. Yet, even after hearing cautionary words about polling and polling analysis, we tend to overreact to every statistical gyration. A Rutgers-Eagleton Senate poll from New Jersey, released Wednesday, shows scandal-scarred Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez up by just 5 points in a state that Hillary Clinton carried by 14 points. Is the race tightening? Could Democrats blow a seemingly safe seat? Or is the poll just a margin-of-error quirk? Multiply this reaction by nearly 500 contested races for Congress and governor, and you have a rough sense of the stress levels on both sides less than 300 hours before the polls open on Election Day. The truth is that all the polling in the world cannot prepare you for a midterm election with this broad a terrain. And there are many hard-fought House races, like in Maine’s 2nd District, where there have only been a handful of reputable polls. Sure, broad questions like the generic ballot (“Do you prefer a Congress controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans?”) can offer national clues. But is the Democrats’ current 8-point average edge on this question enough to comfortably overcome the GOP-leaning effects of incumbency and gerrymandering in the House? A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll of 69 hotly contested House districts found the two parties effectively tied. But is this good news for the Republicans because they are holding their own in battleground races? Or is this a formula for a Democratic sweep since more than 90 percent of the districts surveyed are currently GOP held? Knotty questions like these can make political pundits sound like medieval theologians debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. At a certain level there are no hard truths about the 2018 elections yet — only personal tendencies towards optimism or pessimism. After enduring Election Night 2016, many Democrats are like battered children brooding that once again victory (this time, winning the House) will be snatched from their grasp. Similarly, there are Republicans who believe that Donald Trump will help them defy the polls, while other GOP strategists privately worry that a president with no impulse control is leading them to political doom. For all the twitchiness of the political class, it is also worth remembering that the prevalence of early voting in many states cuts into the ability of a single late-breaking event to reshape the midterms. Already, in early-voting states, we are approaching the point when it is too late to effectively drop opposition research. Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States Sometimes politics is simply perverse. This is not a reference to the Trump triumph in 2016, but rather to an earlier midterm election that should serve as a cautionary tale for all those eager to make glib predictions. In 1986, the Democrats won seven Senate seats by a collective margin of 98,000 votes. Those 98,000 votes were the difference between a 55-45 Democratic Senate and one that was controlled by the GOP. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill said triumphantly after the election, “If there was a Reagan revolution, it’s over.” In the 1960s, an ad campaign for Schlitz, a century-old Milwaukee beer, featured the tagline, “You only go around once in life — go for all the gusto you can.” In elections, as well, you only go around once. So it doesn’t matter that in some alternate universe Hillary Clinton is president and the Republicans held the Senate for Ronald Reagan in 1986. Whatever happens on Nov. 6 will seem foreordained by the gods, but in truth, it will be just one of dozens of equally plausible outcomes. What four decades covering politics has taught me more than anything is humility. Neither I nor anyone practicing punditry on cable TV has the gift of prophesy. But, if I had to guess, I would say that the election comes down to how voters sort out the three dominant fundamentals: A booming economy, albeit with a suddenly shaky stock market. A president who violates every rule of decency with his incessant fearmongering and vicious attacks. And a Democratic Party able to aggressively compete across a broad swatch of GOP-held House districts while grappling with a Senate map wildly tilted toward the Republicans. Beyond that, I will be a traitor to the pundit class as I dispense with glib predictions. Instead, I will bow toward the unknowable as I breathlessly wait until the returns come in on Election Night.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Kyrsten Sinema is trying to do something that no Arizona Democrat has done in 30 years: win a Senate election. “We know we can win this election,” the three-term congresswoman told supporters packed into a union hall here Sunday. “This year, the votes in the Senate matter.” And unlike Democrats in other red or purple states from Texas to Georgia who are running on decidedly progressive platforms, she’s making her case as a moderate with appeal to independents and pragmatic Republicans as she takes on GOP Rep. Martha McSally. If Democrats have any hope of taking back the Senate or mitigating potential losses in red states, they need to win Arizona. But to do that, Sinema will also need to turn out the party faithful in high numbers. It’s a delicate balancing act that few Democrats have been able to accomplish in Arizona in recent years — it’s been a decade since the party last won a statewide race. “Midterms are hard [for Democrats] to win in Arizona, which tells you why Sinema is such a phenomenon, that she’s even keeping it close,” Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said in an interview at a Phoenix coffee shop. Democrats believe the state is trending in their direction, but it’s not clear if Sinema’s strategy will be enough to win this year. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. Recent polls have shown Sinema’s once small, but steady, lead nearly evaporate, with McSally even inching ahead in some surveys. And a loss could have Democrats rethinking how they win a state like Arizona. Also Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange Sinema does have a math problem. Republicans and those not registered with a party still outnumber registered Democrats in the Grand Canyon State. That partisan divide makes some Democrats nervous. Karen Lieneke, a 65-year-old English as a second language teacher in Tucson, said she was “cautiously optimistic” that Sinema could actually win. “The climate of fear and the climate of really raw politics is a wild card to me,” Lieneke said at the union hall. Sinema, a former state legislator, has been helped by an aggressive ad campaign touting herself as a moderate and an independent lawmaker. She was on television as early as April, and went largely unchallenged on the airwaves as McSally battled two others in a competitive GOP primary. Democrats say Arizonans recognize that the once self-described “most liberal legislator in the state” has shifted to the center since first coming to Congress in 2012. In a recent radio interview, Sinema said it was difficult to call herself a proud Democrat, opting instead to call herself a “proud Arizonan.” She has acknowledged her ideological shift — an analysis by CQ Vote Watch found she supported the president’s priorities 60 percent of the time, the third-highest score among House Democrats. “Over the years I am proud to say I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally change my opinion,” she said at a recent debate. But Republicans are trying to paint Sinema as a radical liberal, and highlighting past footage of her knocking the Grand Canyon State. “You guys haven’t reported on Sinema calling our state crazy and saying we’re the meth lab for democracy,” McSally chided reporters after touring a technical school in Avondale on Wednesday. “Every single day something is coming out related to her campaign that’s actually legit, her showing disdain for our state.” The National Republican Senatorial Committee in a recent television ad used video of Sinema implying in 2011 that Arizona produces “crazy,” but the tactic might not work with everyone. Dorothy Byrne, a 77-year-old Phoenix resident not registered with any party, is backing Sinema this year (and all Democrats to protest what she sees as a divisive GOP-controlled government). “Tell us what you want to do today,” Byrne said Monday while waiting to hear Democrat Hiral Tipirneni address a town hall meeting in Arizona’s 8th District. “I don’t care what you did 20 years ago. I didn’t do the same things 20 years ago.” Byrne supported GOP Sen. John McCain in 2016, but wasn’t inclined to support McSally this year. “We need things back a little more in balance,” she said. Democrats see a path to victory with the support of nonpartisan voters like Byrne and moderate Republican women. But Sinema also has to make sure that moderate image doesn’t turn off loyal party members, whom she also needs to turn out in large numbers. Arizona may not yet be a blue state, but it isn’t as red as it used to be. President Donald Trump won it by 4 points in 2016, smaller than his margin in the traditional swing state of Ohio. Democrats supporting Sinema packed two union halls Sunday as she traveled from Tucson to Phoenix to stress the importance of voting early. Not everyone in the room was thrilled with her moderate positions, but they still showed up. “I agree with the president essentially never,” Emily Dacey, 31, said at the Phoenix event, adding that she wished Sinema would be more adamantly opposed to Trump. “But I’m not getting to choose my ideal person,” Dacey said. “I’m getting to choose between Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally. And I’m here to fight for her because she still stands more with me than McSally does.” Democrats are touting an extensive field operation as evidence of energy on the left. The joint effort between the Arizona Democratic Party and Sinema’s campaign boasts 25 field offices and 4,000 volunteers across the state. Over the weekend, volunteers knocked on 65,000 doors, the most ever in one weekend, according to Sinema’s campaign. Gallego said there was a focus on getting out the vote this year and that turning out Latino and Native American voters were key to a Democratic victory. But so far, early ballot returns give Republicans an edge. As of Wednesday evening, 44 percent of the early ballot returns were from Republicans, while 33 percent were from Democrats. Gallego, who is weighing a Senate run of his own in 2020, said future efforts may have to concentrate more on turning out the Democratic base. He said an emphasis on voter registration could close the gap as the state shifts demographically with its growing cities. “Arizona’s changing. It just is,” said DJ Quinlan, the former executive director of the state Democratic Party. “The notion that Arizona is this bright red state is no longer accurate. It’s going to be a swing state from this point forward” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Opinion One Person, One Vote. Is It That Complicated? OPINION — I admit that voting is and has always been a celebratory ritual for me, even if the candidate is running unopposed, the office is state agriculture commissioner or my district’s makeup means my one vote won’t make much of a difference. I watched three older siblings march for civil rights, and I am well aware that many brave folks died protecting my right to cast that ballot. While a little rain or a busy schedule might provide an excuse to “sit this one out,” it’s never enough to outweigh the legacy left by a Medgar Evers, who served his country in World War II and was murdered in front of his Mississippi home for, among other civil rights activity, leading voter registration drives in the country he protected. Mine is not a controversial stand — in fact, it’s patriotic. You would think our country’s leaders, without regard to party or politics, would be on my side. You would be wrong. When Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 wrote the majority opinion gutting key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — those that compelled certain states to “preclear” any changes in their voting rules — he insisted that so much had changed in the country that those rules were no longer needed. “The Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Racism is dead, or on its last legs, he seemed to declare. I would not call Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent cynical. It was realistic. As she wrote: “As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abundantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as attempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that originally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.” What Year Is It? Trump’s Midterm Rallies Are Mostly About His 2020 Re-Election Bid In a perfect country, politicians would rejoice at the chance to win the hearts and minds of constituents with strong policies, to show how inclusive their party’s big tent could be. But we are not living in Oz, no matter how much the judges who joined Roberts in the majority decision might have wished. As Ginsburg predicted, the poll taxes, literary tests and lynchings may have disappeared. But the intent remained in full force. The 2013 Shelby County v. Holder ruling was a green light for the shenanigans the federal government once prevented states from pulling. Moving of polling places. Strict ID restrictions targeting minorities, the poor, the elderly and the young. Same-day registrations that made voting easier for those working two and three job. Purges of voting lists. The list was limited only by the imaginations of those making it. And boy, did the folks who wanted to choose their voters, instead of letting their voters choose them, have great imaginations. These new tactics are in bold view in the midterm elections of 2018, with states still mired in lawsuits over restrictions legislators have justified as a fight against that boogeyman, voter fraud, which every study has proved insignificant. In North Dakota, the votes of the original Americans, Native Americans, have been disproportionately jeopardized by a ruling that says a street address rather than a post office box on registrations is required in that sparsely populated state. In North Carolina, a voter ID bill that has been thrown out by the courts for targeting minority voters with “almost surgical precision” may yet rise from the dead if an amendment to the state’s constitution passes. Georgia is in a category all by itself. Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, has refused to recuse himself from his day job of secretary of state, which puts him in charge of overseeing elections, including his own. Cozy, wouldn’t you say? Even GOP secretary of state and Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, the king of efforts to suppress the vote to fight hordes of supposed illegal voters, has passed his election duties over to a deputy. Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first African-American woman elected governor in this country. What some see as evidence of how far America has come, others see as reason for a second civil war, this time on voting rights. Georgia election officials have been accused of tossing out a disproportionate number of absentee ballots from minority voters, and holding up close to 53,000 voter registrations because they do not satisfy a controversial “exact match” requirement with all other government documents. (An errant hyphen or period might be the culprit.) A county official kicked black senior citizens off a bus that was heading to the polls, as if those senior citizens had not already heard enough government officials tell them “no.” What side is the president on? “All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING,” Trump tweeted. “Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!” Not exactly an invitation — more like a warning and a threat. It’s no surprise from a president who insisted the 3 million votes that gave Hillary Clinton a popular vote win in 2016 were the result of illegal voters and fraud. His administration’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, with Kobach front and center, charged with tracking down those voters, I suspect was disbanded for lack of evidence and because state election officials turned their bipartisan backs on requests for intrusive voting records. The integrity and the results of the elections coming up in two weeks could be called into question because of the fruits of that Supreme Court decision. The country is facing the prospect of having an election with results that few trust, to be decided at a later date. All these conflicts will have repercussions long after the midterms — resentments and accusations and an America more divided than ever, sowing more distrust in institutions, this time not law enforcement or the media, but democracy itself. I wish, for his family and our country’s sake, that Medgar Evers were alive, though his spirit and resolve live on in the work of many. There is still so much work to do. Mary C.

Politics The Coincidence of Bomb Recipients, Trump and Far-Right Rhetoric ANALYSIS | The recipients of explosive devices sent this week have so far shared a commonality: harsh criticism by President Donald Trump and far-right followers. But White House officials were in no mood Wednesday to entertain the notion that the president’s descriptions of Democrats as “evil” and news organizations as the “enemy of the people” might have helped lead a bomber to build devices and mail them to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and CNN. A building in Miami that houses an office for former Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also evacuated Wednesday. Trump’s aides declined to comment beyond a statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning what she called “attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures.” “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” Sanders said. Vice President Mike Pence later tweeted his condemnation of the attempted bombings; Trump tweeted this agreement. I agree wholeheartedly! https://t.co/ndzu0A30vU  [Suspicious Package Cases Grow, Debbie Wasserman Schultz First Known Congressional Target] But the matter has one glaring common denominator: Trump’s sharp rhetoric about each recipient and a highly partisan midterm election that has only deepened a widely divided country’s tribal wounds. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” chanted a rally crowd Monday night in Houston, where Trump was firing up the base as he and Sen. Ted Cruz tried to keep the senator’s seat in Republican hands. Trump pivoted from one topic to the next in the manner that defines his raucous stream-of-consciousness rallies, heading straight toward a line sure to ignite the Toyota Center crowd: “If you want the fake news to finally investigate Hillary Clinton, we’ll just have…” That’s when the familiar chant broke out. “Man,” an impressed Trump said before trying to pass off any responsibility: “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.” But if the president was concerned his constant calls for his former political foe to face a federal investigation, it certainly didn’t stop him. “So if you want them to investigate, we’ll just have to nominate Hillary Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. How do you like that?” he said as the crowd booed loudly. “Right? Let’s see how she does. If [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh had to go through what he went through ... can you imagine Hillary up there? That would take three to four years of questions.” His supporters laughed in unison. Trump used the line about Clinton to move into his ramped-up rhetoric about all Democrats, saying the midterms are all about preventing “the radical Democrat mob” from taking “a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country and our economy.” Monday night’s rally alone featured multiple sharp attacks on Democrats as the president eagerly accuses the opposition party of being the “party of crime” that wants to allow undocumented migrants pour over the U.S.-Mexico border to flood the country with crime and drugs while raising taxes and ending programs like Social Security and Medicaid. He blasted Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke for voting for what he called “Obama amnesty.” Trump told the crowd in Houston that Immigration and Border Control officers are fighting “a war” against undocumented individuals — and he essentially told them to blame Obama. “They go in and they take them and they throw them into the paddy wagon, then get them the hell out of our country. We’ve removed thousands, thousands of them. They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people,” he said. “And the towns are liberated. ... I’m telling you, it’s like a war.” Watching a single “Make America Great Again” rally shows how the president’s supporters direct their ire at his political foes, especially Clinton and CNN. A mere mention of the “fake news media” elicited an unprompted chant in Houston: “CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!” “I don’t like them either, OK?” Trump said. Trump is slated to lead rallies Wednesday night in Wisconsin, Friday night in North Carolina and Saturday in Illinois. White House officials gave no indication that he is considering canceling one or all in an attempt to cool down the country’s white-hot political climate. Sanders did not respond to an email asking whether Trump is concerned his words might have played a role in the bomber’s mindset, and if he might cancel one or all of those rallies. Wasserman-Schultz has been a target of Trump’s rhetoric for several years, with her stint at the DNC putting her on his radar. As the 2016 general election was about to heat up, Trump fired off this tweet: “The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she’s out!” [Trump’s Tax Cut Gambit Gets Heads Scratching] Then there’s Soros. Trump on Oct. 5 lashed out at Soros in a tweet, blaming him for financing left-wing protesters who lined Capitol Hill hallways and Washington streets objecting to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!” the president tweeted, adding this hashtag: “#Troublemakers.” The president has also floated the idea, without evidence, that Democrats are financing a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico and heading for the U.S. border. “It was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,” Pence said Monday in the Oval Office before being interrupted by his boss. “And the Democrats, maybe? And the Democrats?” Trump asked with a chuckle. “Well,” Pence started to say before he was cut off. CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked Trump for proof of the Democrat’s involvement. “You know what? You’re going to find out, and we’re going to see,” he said, again offering no evidence. The list of targets grew as did the glare of their shared commonality. Sanders responded with a second statement around midday Wednesday, this time via Twitter. “Our condemnation of these dispicable [sic] acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of explosive devices mailed to the news network and several prominent Democratic politicians and donors. “These cowardly acts are unacceptable and wont be tolerated.” This is an ongoing situation that President Trump and his admin are monitoring closely.

Martha McSally continues to face criticism for her vote to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act, and engaged in a heated exchange with a local reporter over protections for people with pre-existing conditions after an event Wednesday. “I have fought for pre-existing conditions. I voted to protect pre-existing conditions. This is personal,” the Arizona Republican told reporters after touring the Universal Technical Institute. Brahm Resnik of the Phoenix NBC affiliate interjected, noting the GOP measure to repeal the 2010 health care law would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Watch: McSally Defends Health Care Record in Testy Media Exchange “It’s not true. It’s not true. Stop parroting Democratic talking points,” McSally said. “Health care is a complex issue. Right now it’s not working. Right now people with pre-existing conditions can’t get access to health care on the health insurance market or the individual insurance market because Obamacare has failed.” The GOP bill, known as the American Health Care Act, included a provision that prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. However, it also provided states an avenue to waive certain regulations, which could have allowed insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for coverage, potentially rendering health care unaffordable. McSally voted for the GOP bill, and reportedly told her Republican colleagues the day of the vote to get this “f---ing thing” done. McSally’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has made health care central to her campaign. The two lawmakers are competing in an open seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Sinema accused McSally in a tweet Wednesday of lying about her record in response to a new McSally television ad where she said she has worked to force insurance companies to protect people with pre-existing conditions. “Here’s the truth: I voted to protect coverage for the 2.8 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions,” Sinema tweeted. “Martha voted to take it away.” Inside Elections with Nathan L.

Politics NARAL Launches Final Push to Fire Up Abortion Rights Voters With voters already casting ballots in states that allow early voting, outside advocacy groups are not just trying to reach potential new voters — they’re working to make sure their most ardent supporters actually show up. That is certainly the case with NARAL, which is announcing a final push to make sure that the abortion rights group’s supporters get out to vote in 2018. The organization is launching a new $750,000 campaign that will feature direct mail and digital advertising geared toward supporters in 17 key races as the campaign cycle nears its end. According to a listing provided to Roll Call ahead of formal release, the mailers are being directed to Senate contests in Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada and Wisconsin. According to a summary of the plan for the final weeks, which was provided first to Roll Call, the House races involved include key seats in Arizona, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. NARAL is also targeting the governor’s races in Iowa, New Mexico and Nevada. NARAL is trying to make sure that the group’s core supporters, many of whom were recently even more engaged over the Senate confirmation process of Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, actually make it to the polls (either through early voting where it’s possible or on Election Day). “Based on the energy we are seeing from voters across the country, we’re supercharging our program to move voters to elect pro-choice champions.The stakes have never been higher,” said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue. “The threat to Roe v. Wade is real and on the horizon.” “Women are fired up and ready to elect candidates in their communities who support us and our families. Our job is to reach as many of them as possible in the next two weeks,” Hogue said. In addition to a national umbrella digital ad, the group’s produced several for individual candidates, including Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The direct mail and new round of digital ads in many of the same jurisdictions are beyond $5 million in midterm-related spending already, including a previously announced $1 million for TV and digital ads and $750,000 for an earlier campaign effort.

Politics GOP Ads Target Young Female Voters on Violence Against Women Act An outside group dedicated to electing Republican women is launching digital ads urging three lawmakers to support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire in December. The digital ads, obtained first by Roll Call, target Reps. Mimi Walters of California and Barbara Comstock of Virginia — both facing tough re-elections — and Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, who’s running for Senate. All three are being challenged by Democratic women. In a year that’s seen high enthusiasm among female voters for Democratic candidates, especially in suburban districts, these issue ads try to highlight GOP lawmakers’ advocacy for women. Republicans are at risk of seeing the number of women in their House conference decline next year. Running on Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Hulu, the ads are targeted to younger women, softer Republican voters and independents, and are backed by a six-figure digital buy across the three states. The ads are part of the MyRoar campaign, which is paid for by Winning for Women. The group’s PAC has endorsed all three women, who are also identified as “Lionesses” on the MyRoar website. One version of the ad begins by explaining the Violence Against Women Act. “What if there was a law that provided defense for victims of sexual assault?” the narrator asks. “Well that law expires in just months,” the narrator continues. “But what if I told you you could help the efforts of women like Congresswoman Barbara Comstock to keep it alive when Congress returns?” “What if I told you that you could be heard?” the narrator says, as the face of a young woman appears on screen. Another version of the ad opens with statistics about rape and sexual assault and the percentage of the offenders who see jail time. Things would be “a lot worse” without the Violence Against Women Act, the narrator says. “Congresswoman Mimi Walters has been working hard for women. Learn how to help Mimi keep working to pass a bigger, better Violence Against Women Act when Congress returns,” the narrator says. The Violence Against Women Act was supposed to expire on Sept. 30, but it was extended under a stopgap spending bill in September. Led by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats have introduced legislation to reauthorize the law with updates, including a provision that would prohibit those under protective order from possessing firearms. No Republicans have signed on to the Democratic proposal. Flashback: Democrats Hope to Extend Violence Against Women Act GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and John J. Faso of New York and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced their own six-month reauthorization legislation in September. Walters is listed as a co-sponsor on that measure. Comstock and McSally are not. Forty-six Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last month asking for urgent action to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act before its Sept. 30 expiration. Comstock and Walters signed on to that letter. McSally did not. “In Congress, all three of these women have a strong track record of supporting legislation that promotes and empowers women. Each is a warrior. And we look forward to their continued commitment to the Violence Against Women Act and to victims of violence and sexual assault across the country,” Winning For Women Executive Director Rebecca Schuller said in a statement. Comstock is running for a third term in Virginia's 10th District against Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates her race Tilts Democratic.

Meanwhile, in Non-Pipe Bomb Political Midterm News … Politics Gallego Weighs 2020 Senate Run, Confident About Primary Prospects PHOENIX — Rep. Ruben Gallego is focused on helping Democrats win in Arizona in 2018, but he’s also weighing a Senate run of his own in two years time. And he’s confident he would win a Democratic primary. The Arizona Democrat has previously said he is considering a run for the 2020 special election for the last two years of the late Republican Sen. John McCain’s term. Former GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed to McCain’s seat, but he has said he plans to step down at the end of the year. “At the end of the day, I think we’re going to make a determination based on: Can we win? And can we make a difference for Arizona?” Gallego said in an interview here at a local coffee shop Tuesday morning. “And that’s it. I’m not really worried about a primary.” The two-term congressman from the 7th District was confident he could defeat Grant Woods, McCain’s former chief of staff and onetime state attorney general. Woods has said he is considering switching parties to run as a Democrat or independent. “Grant Woods cannot win a Democratic primary in Arizona. So he can make his own determination, and I will just make my own in my own time,” Gallego said. “And we’ll go to a race, and I’ll defeat him and that will be that.” “He was [co-]chairman of Gov. [Jan] Brewer’s re-election campaign after SB 1070,” the congressman added, referring to the state’s controversial 2010 immigration law. “That’s not going to fly with Democrats” Watch: Fiery Arizona Debate in 4 Minutes Gallego said his decision will also hinge on whether Democrats win back the House in November, citing the possibility that he could become the next chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He also said he had to consider how to balance a Senate run with caring for his young son. Another factor in his decision to run? The outcome of this year’s competitive Senate race that features two House colleagues — Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally — for retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. “It’s difficult winning statewide here. And luckily you have a great example in how Sinema is being competitive about it,” Gallego said. “I would probably have to look strongly about [it]. There’s no guarantee that I would win.” Gallego, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, was first elected in 2014, winning a competitive Democratic primary for his Phoenix-area seat. He has been among the Democrats critical of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan for leader two years ago. Pelosi has opened the door to a short-term speakership should Democrats win back the House. Asked if that would be acceptable to anti-Pelosi Democrats, Gallego said, “I think she needs to first focus on making sure the Democrats win before she starts coming up with her platform and how she wants to transfer her power because she doesn’t have the power of speakership right now.” Any discussions about who could lead the House Democrats in the next Congress should wait until after the election, according to Gallego. “Anything before that is totally inappropriate, on her part or anybody else’s part,” he said.

Citing a dementia diagnosis that would most likely progress to Alzheimer’s disease, the 88-year-old said she was “no longer able to participate in public life,” something that defined her career. In making her announcement, O’Connor reminded the nation that the high court, on which she served from 1981 to 2006, was bookended by public service as not only a judge but as an accomplished state legislator and as a senior judge and elder stateswoman on political engagement through her founding of the group iCivics. “Not long after I retired from the Supreme Court twelve years ago, I made a commitment to myself, my family, and my country that I would use whatever years I had left to advance civic learning and engagement. I feel so strongly about the topic because I’ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government, and participate actively in their communities,” she wrote in the letter announcing her decision on Tuesday. The confirmation fight of the newest justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a bitter partisan fight that partially centered on whether, given his background in the George W. Bush White House and his work for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, he could be an impartial jurist given his history in politics. But O’Connor showed that a political career need not necessarily taint a jurist’s. In 1969, she was appointed to an Arizona state Senate seat, then won election to it outright in 1970. She went on to become majority leader, another first for a woman in the Legislature, before opting to run for election to a local judgeship. That set her along the path that would lead to President Ronald Reagan making her the first woman on the high court. After her retirement from Supreme Court, she continued to hear cases as many retired justices do, in the federal court system, all the while starting iCivics and taking care of her husband John Jay O’Connor III, who died in 2009 of Alzheimer’s disease. Chief Justice John Roberts had that civic legacy in mind in his response to the news. “I was saddened to learn that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, like many Americans, faces the challenge of dementia. But I was not at all surprised that she used the occasion of sharing that fact to think of our country first, and to urge an increased commitment to civics education, a cause to which she devoted so much of her time and indomitable energy,” Roberts wrote in a statement released by the Supreme Court. It is fitting that O’Connor’s announcement comes the same day the legacy institution of another Arizona icon, the late Sen. John McCain, announced an initiative to encourage civic participation, voting and respect for human rights. The McCain Institute’s “Mavericks Needed” campaign will run an ad through Election Day and then start a second campaign to last through 2020. “Now more than ever, America needs a new generation of Mavericks to stand up, speak out, serve causes greater than themselves, get in the area and vote on November 6th,” McCain’s widow Cindy, said in a statement. Cindy McCain was elected chairwoman of the McCain Institute last week. The two Arizonans, both of whom came to Washington in the early 1980s, leave the stage but with instructions on what to do in their absences.

Policy Rob Portman’s Report on Trump Trade Policy to Feature Mixed Results A key Republican senator sees positive signs in the Trump administration’s trade discussions with Canada and Mexico, but he still has plenty of criticism for the White House, too. In a major trade policy speech at the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday morning, Sen. Rob Portman is planning to focus on the effects of the Trump trade agenda on the auto industry, a key business in his manufacturing-heavy home state of Ohio. “I’m still reviewing the details of the updated NAFTA agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but I am encouraged by what I’ve seen so far,” Portman, a former U.S. trade representative, is expected to say. “One of the most substantial changes to NAFTA is the rules of origin for automobiles. In the time since NAFTA was ratified 24 years ago, the United States has lost about 350,000 auto jobs, while Mexico gained 430,000.” Portman’s indications of support of that framework is in contrast with his view of what the Commerce Department has done with using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose tariffs, even on close allies, using a nebulous “national security” justification. In his remarks, Portman is expected to speak to the proposal, which has been stalled in the Senate, to rework the trade law to restrict it to true national security implications. “The administration has used Section 232 to impose a new 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports worldwide,” the Ohio senator is expected to say. “For certain countries and certain products, I believe there is a national security issue with steel — including electrical steel, which is critical to the grid. But broadly imposing tariffs on our allies risks them retaliating by putting tariffs on our products.” “Simply put, auto and auto part imports are not a national security threat, and as I’ve been saying for months, these tariffs are a bad idea,” reads a copy of Portman’s prepared speech, which was obtained by Roll Call. Portman will outline views more favorable to Trump and the harder line of his administration when it comes to trade with China, citing Chinese policies such as requirements for joint ventures for U.S. automakers to do business in the communist country. The speech is expected to include a degree of support for the tariff announcements as part of negotiations with China. “While I do have concerns about some of the collateral damage these tariffs can do to folks trying to make products in America, I think this assertiveness on China is needed,” Portman is scheduled to say. “Republican and Democrat administrations alike have tried to get China’s attention on the trade issue and failed. China has been violating and circumventing our trade laws for decades. I think the Trump administration now has China’s attention, and I applaud the president for taking a tough stand.” But Portman is also expected to say that he does not view shortcuts like the purchase of additional soybeans from American producers by China as a solution to the trade issues between the two countries. “Instead, the United States should push for structural changes to the Chinese economy to reduce the ways Beijing distorts the economy in its favor and tilts the playing field away from American workers,” Portman is scheduled to tell the Heritage audience.

And it was Nancy Connell, not Liz Sockett, who told us predatory bacteria might one day be useful as a preventive in advance of an anticipated germ warfare attack.

In a previous version of the Web story, a photo caption misstated Abby Hutton's last name as Haughton. Also, we said Hilary Cooley expected federal protections to be removed by the end of the year.

Kyrsten Sinema was previously misidentified in a caption as a Republican instead of a Democrat. An earlier version of this story suggested that Election Day will be Nov. 7. It is actually Nov. 6.

A previous version of this story also incorrectly stated the function of neuraminidase. The virus uses neuraminidase while exiting the cell, not entering the cell. An earlier version of this story said the average amount of U.S. content in a Ford vehicle sold in the U.S. is 80 percent, according to Joe Hinrichs, Ford's head of global operations. In fact, 80 percent refers to the share of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. that were assembled in the U.S. Previous audio and Web versions of this story said that Barrett Brown heard about Anonymous in 2003. In fact, it was in 2006. Also, the raid on Brown referenced in those versions of the story took place in his apartment, not his mother's home, and he posted the YouTube video after a previous raid at his mother's home. Additionally, those versions said Brown had served time in prison for being part of Anonymous. While he was connected to Anonymous, the prison sentence was for threatening a federal officer and other charges to which he pleaded guilty. And in the audio, as in the previous Web version, Brown's project is called Pursuant. The actual name of the project is Pursuance. Also, in the audio version we say that Stratfor was involved in top-secret government missions like the killing of Osama bin Laden. We should have said that Stratfor emails written in the hours after bin Laden's death and released after an Anonymous hack included sensitive information about the mission, not that Stratfor was involved in that mission. A previous version of this story incorrectly said the California case on unions was decided last year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Both events actually occurred in 2016. A caption in a previous version of this story described Lindsey Vonn as a gold medalist. Although she won a gold medal in a previous Olympics, she took home bronze in Pyeongchang. A previous version of this story stated that Canada won a bronze medal in men's curling this year. It lost the bronze to Switzerland. A previous version of this story misspelled the names of Alexia Paganini and Sofia Goggia. This post had also suggested that 2,646 athletes wouldn't win medals – an incorrect total that does not account for the multiple medals given out in sports with more than one competitor. It's still accurate that most of the 2,952 athletes who compete in the 2018 Winter Games will not earn a medal. A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Edgar Degas as Edward Degas. A previous caption, relying on information from Getty Images, incorrectly said the photo of the NRA booth was taken on the first day of CPAC. It was actually taken Friday.

A previous version of this story misspelled Tomas Valasik's last name as Valashik.

Duncan Hunter of California and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania from before they entered Congress. An earlier version of this story mistakenly listed the setting of a car chase as Seoul. In an earlier version of this post, Rep. Speier was identified as representing Florida. She represents California. A previous version of this story said President Trump's son Eric Trump ran the then-candidate Trump's election campaign in Iowa. It was then-Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's son Eric Branstad who led the Iowa campaign. A previous version of this puzzle featured the wrong challenge for next week. A previous version of this story incorrectly said President Trump met with lawmakers on Monday. The White House meeting was on Tuesday. A previous version of this story incorrectly described Leviathan as "Oscar-winning." The 2014 film was nominated but did not take home the prize.

In a previous version of this story, Lizzy Devine's last name was misspelled as Divine.

A previous Web introduction to this story referred to 18 school shootings. While 18 shootings have taken place on school property, not all of them were described as targeted events. In a previous audio version of this story, we incorrectly said there has never been a female school shooter. In fact, there have been some females who committed school shootings. A previous version of this story stated that the U.S. rate of gun deaths should be 20 percent lower based on its socioeconomic status. The actual rate is about five times as high. A previous version of this story misquoted Broward County Mayor Beam Furr as saying there are 21 cities in the county. He actually said there are 31.

A previous version of this story and caption incorrectly said that Margaret Good's victory was by 7 percent and that the district had previously voted for President Trump by 5 percent. Those numbers are actually percentage points. An earlier summary of this report on the homepage mistakenly stated that attorney Michael Cohen said his $130,000 payment was reimbursed by either the Trump campaign or the Trump Organization. In fact, he has said the payment was not reimbursed by either the campaign or the Trump Organization and that it came from his own pocket. In an earlier version of this story, we misstated the source for a figure. The Trump administration, not Congress, added $2 billion to its earlier HUD funding request.

In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question. The blog Paul Vanderveen's Attitude of Reciprocity drew NPR's attention back to this story.

In a previous version of this story and headline, NPR reported that four people had been killed. The correct number of casualties is three dead and four injured.

It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.

The movie was released in 2004 but won its Oscar in 2005. Also, the story said The Dark Knight was passed over for best picture in 2008. The movie came out in 2008, but the nominations and awards show were in 2009. In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses.

A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published.
