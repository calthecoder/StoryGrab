2.0-split-http://www.rollcall.com/gonzales-split-Election analysis from Nathan L. Gonzales New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, center, upset House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joseph Crowley in a June primary. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) What will be the biggest surprise on election night? It’s a common and valid question, but I’m always a little amused by it. The race for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith’s Mississippi seat lists among the complicating factors that might impede calling control of the Senate on Nov. 6, Gonzales writes. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) After two years of campaigning in the latest most consequential election of our lifetimes, election night could be a huge letdown. The disappointment is not about which party prevails Nov. 6, but the reality that a combination of close races and West Coast contests could prevent enough races from being called to determine majorities in Congress until days later. In the Senate, more than 10 races could finish within single digits, and a handful of those contests look like they’re neck and neck. The close margins could make it difficult for media outlets to project a winner on election night. Since Republicans have just a two-seat majority, every Senate race matters, so anything left uncalled could make it difficult to figure out who will control the chamber next year. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, is getting a lot of press as he takes on Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. But much of the coverage misses some key points about his political rise. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) I’m pretty sure three new profiles of Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke have been published in the time it took me to write this lede. Yet the only thing more remarkable than the sheer volume of stories written about the congressman is that none of them put his 2012 House victory in proper context. I read more than a dozen profiles, and they most often describe a young, sweaty candidate with Kennedy-esque looks and punk sensibilities as an accidental and almost reluctant challenger to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. But O’Rourke was never going to be content with being on the El Paso City Council or playing bass for the band Foss. California Democrat Harley Rouda, here with a supporter at a rally in Laguna Beach in May, is challenging GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in the 48th District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) With a growing number of vulnerable House districts, there might be too much to watch for on election night. But by focusing on just a handful of states, you can get a pretty good idea of whether Democrats are having a good enough night to gain the 23 seats necessary to win back the majority. Competitive races: 5 Ohio Democrat Aftab Pureval’s latest ad “Slugger” raises more than a few questions for Nathan L. Gonzales. (Screenshot/Aftab for Congress/YouTube) When I saw Ohio Democrat Aftab Pureval playing softball in a campaign ad, I felt like my years of election analysis and beer-league softball were finally coming together. Pureval, the Hamilton County clerk of courts, is challenging Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in Ohio’s 1st District. He’s running a competitive race (which we’ve rated Leans Republican) and outraised the congressman through June 30 ($1.6 million to $959,000). Labor Day is supposed to be the official start of general election season, but many of the top House and Senate races are well underway. In fact, the campaign trail has been so busy that Inside Elections recently issued 32 race ratings changes, most in favor of the Democrat in the race. Rep. Duncan Hunter R-Calif., lines up his shot during the First Tee’s Congressional Challenge annual golf tournament at the Columbia Country Club golf course Monday June 25, 2018. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) Whenever a member of Congress is indicted, it’s a good idea to take a long, hard look at their re-election chances. It’s also reasonable to believe their prospects for another term would be diminished and political handicappers would immediately downgrade their race. But it’s not so simple with GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter and California’s 50th District. When New York Republican Chris Collins was indicted a couple weeks ago, we shifted New York’s 27th District from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. It was an acknowledgment that an indictment at least warrants a district be on the list of competitive races. Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., was reportedly arrested on Wednesday. (Al Drago/CQ Roll Call file photo) If Rep. Chris Collins continues to run for re-election, he would do so while facing charges of insider trading and lying to the F.B.I. But just because a member of Congress is indicted, doesn’t mean they can’t win. GOP Rep. Michael Grimm of New York and Democratic Rep. William J. Jefferson of Louisiana are two recent examples of incumbents who won re-election in the face of significant legal problems. Politicians aren’t always to blame for the dysfunction in Congress and the perceived solutions are more complicated than many realize, Gonzales writes. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) After 30 years of covering Congress, David Hawkings has a good idea of how Capitol Hill works — or more important, how it doesn’t — and he laid out five key reasons why Congress is broken. But whether it’s money, maps, media, mingling or masochism, there are no easy solutions. Nor are they entirely the responsibility of the politicians to address. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, faces Democrat Colin Allred in his bid for a 12th term representing the Dallas area. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) In 2010, Texas Rep. Pete Sessions led Republicans to a historic 63-seat gain in the House and a new GOP majority as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Now, he’s at significant risk of losing his own seat. Sessions represents the Dallas-area 32nd District, which Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points in 2016. It’s the type of suburban, college-educated area that has been revolting against President Donald Trump since he took office. But for much of the cycle, Sessions benefitted from a fundraising advantage and a competitive Democratic primary, which was only decided in a May runoff. Students march to the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue to call on Congress to act on gun violence prevention during a national walkout on April 20 to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Gun control has been a third rail of Democratic campaigns, but a new poll suggests that Democratic candidates should embrace a bolder approach to restrictions on guns, even in general elections. Up to this point, Democrats have been decidedly defensive on guns. The most famous instances of Democratic candidates using guns in television ads include West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III shooting the so-called cap-and-trade bill, former Georgia Rep. John Barrow talking about his granddaddy’s pistol and Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander assembling a rifle blindfolded. The ads were meant to reassure voters that Democrats didn’t want to take away their guns. Two men argue over abortion at the Families Belong Together protest outside of the White House Saturday June 30, 2018. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) While recent polling from NBC News/Wall Street Journal showed an uptick in support for Roe v. Wade, other survey data on abortion reflects a remarkably consistent and nuanced approach from Americans on the choice issue that stretches across decades. The recent survey of 900 registered voters, conducted July 15-18, showed 71 percent believe the 1973 decision, which established a woman’s legal right to an abortion, should be kept in place while 23 percent believe the ruling should be overturned. A demonstrator holds a sign at a news conference last week to announce the launch of the Medicare for All Caucus. Health care is a key component of the Democrats’ messaging this fall, Gonzales writes. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) I swore I’d never do it again. In October, I interviewed 16 Democratic House candidates in two days. As much as I enjoy having face-to-face conversations with people running for the offices we cover, it might have been too many in a row. Rating change for New Jersey's 2nd District race: The open seat contest to replace retiring GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo, pictured here, shifts to favor Democrats. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Sometimes political handicapping can be difficult. Shifting a well-liked Democratic senator in North Dakota, who has won a close and competitive race previously, to Tilts Republican from Toss-Up wasn’t an easy decision. But Republican Seth Grossman is making it easy for political analysts. The former Atlantic County Freeholder won the GOP nomination in New Jersey’s 2nd District on June 5, but the National Republican Congressional Committee disavowed him on Monday after multiple offensive statements came to light. “Bigotry has no place in society — let alone the U.S. House of Representatives,” said NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers of Ohio. The Federal Election Commission sent a letter to Club for Conservatives PAC last month with questions about its previously filed reports. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images file photo) Rep. Marsha Blackburn is locked in a competitive and expensive race for Senate. But the Tennessee Republican’s campaign decided to return a sizable contribution from a political action committee that’s facing scrutiny from campaign finance regulators. “Club for Conservatives PAC did not meet our standards for transparency,” Blackburn campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler said.

2.0-split-https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims_us_5bd4bb77e4b0a8f17ef85213-split-Eight men and three women, ranging in age from 97 to 54, were killed at a crowded Pittsburgh synagogue after an alleged gunman opened fire on the congregation during Saturday services, officials have announced. Allegheny County medical examiner Karl Williams named the victims at a news conference Sunday morning: Joyce Feinberg, 75 Richard Gottfried, 65 Rose Mallinger, 97 Jerry Rabinowitz, 66 Brothers Cecil, 59 and David Rosenthal, 54 Husband and wife Sylvan, 86 and Bernice Simon, 84 Daniel Stein, 71 Melvin Wax, 88 Irving Youngner, 69 Williams said that the victims’ families had been notified and are “in shock and grieving.” Their bodies are undergoing autopsies, and authorities are “doing everything in our power that honors both civil and religious law,” he said. It could take up to a week to finish processing the crime scene, given that bodies were found in three different locations, Williams said. “There are shell casings everywhere,” he said. Rabinowitz was a doctor, cat lover and “the kindest person you could dream of meeting,” his friend, Anna Boswell-Levy, said in a Facebook post. “He was such a good and caring man,” added Lisa Wesson-Richardson, one of his employees. “This is such huge loss to his family, his staff and his patients!” Stein, a retired plumbing salesman as well as a husband, father of two and grandfather of one, attended Shabbat services every Saturday morning, his nephew, Steven Halle, told WPXI News on Saturday. “Everybody loved him, there wasn’t one person that didn’t like him in the community,” Halle said. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die,” before carrying out the attack, according to police sources. Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges against him on Saturday evening, 22 of which could result in him being sentenced to death. Bowers brought three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle into the synagogue, all of which he used in the massacre, Williams said. He’s expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. A Torah study and Shabbat services were scheduled at the synagogue on Saturday. During the shooting, a bris ― a Jewish circumcision ceremony for an infant boy ― was reportedly taking place at the Tree of Life synagogue. Six people, including four police officers, were injured. One officer has been released from hospitalization and officials said a second one is expected to be released sometime on Sunday. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” This story has been updated with details on some of the victims.

All market data delayed 20 minutes. Democrats on the midterm-campaign trail have trotted out their fabrications about Republicans demolishing medical coverage. Alaska isn’t normally much on the national political radar, but by the end of Nov. 6 it could hold some notable distinctions. The best way for Republicans to earn the votes of undecided voters is to clearly articulate how they would fix our broken health- care system. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting shows anti-Semitism is a serious problem in America that must not be ignored. In the last few weeks, health officials in a number of states have reported deaths attributable to flu.
