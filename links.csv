---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/gonzales---split---Election analysis from Nathan L. Gonzales New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, center, upset House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joseph Crowley in a June primary. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) What will be the biggest surprise on election night? It’s a common and valid question, but I’m always a little amused by it. The race for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith’s Mississippi seat lists among the complicating factors that might impede calling control of the Senate on Nov. 6, Gonzales writes. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) After two years of campaigning in the latest most consequential election of our lifetimes, election night could be a huge letdown. The disappointment is not about which party prevails Nov. 6, but the reality that a combination of close races and West Coast contests could prevent enough races from being called to determine majorities in Congress until days later. In the Senate, more than 10 races could finish within single digits, and a handful of those contests look like they’re neck and neck. The close margins could make it difficult for media outlets to project a winner on election night. Since Republicans have just a two-seat majority, every Senate race matters, so anything left uncalled could make it difficult to figure out who will control the chamber next year. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, is getting a lot of press as he takes on Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. But much of the coverage misses some key points about his political rise. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) I’m pretty sure three new profiles of Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke have been published in the time it took me to write this lede. Yet the only thing more remarkable than the sheer volume of stories written about the congressman is that none of them put his 2012 House victory in proper context. I read more than a dozen profiles, and they most often describe a young, sweaty candidate with Kennedy-esque looks and punk sensibilities as an accidental and almost reluctant challenger to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. But O’Rourke was never going to be content with being on the El Paso City Council or playing bass for the band Foss. California Democrat Harley Rouda, here with a supporter at a rally in Laguna Beach in May, is challenging GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in the 48th District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) With a growing number of vulnerable House districts, there might be too much to watch for on election night. But by focusing on just a handful of states, you can get a pretty good idea of whether Democrats are having a good enough night to gain the 23 seats necessary to win back the majority. Competitive races: 5 Ohio Democrat Aftab Pureval’s latest ad “Slugger” raises more than a few questions for Nathan L. Gonzales. (Screenshot/Aftab for Congress/YouTube) When I saw Ohio Democrat Aftab Pureval playing softball in a campaign ad, I felt like my years of election analysis and beer-league softball were finally coming together. Pureval, the Hamilton County clerk of courts, is challenging Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in Ohio’s 1st District. He’s running a competitive race (which we’ve rated Leans Republican) and outraised the congressman through June 30 ($1.6 million to $959,000). Labor Day is supposed to be the official start of general election season, but many of the top House and Senate races are well underway. In fact, the campaign trail has been so busy that Inside Elections recently issued 32 race ratings changes, most in favor of the Democrat in the race. Rep. Duncan Hunter R-Calif., lines up his shot during the First Tee’s Congressional Challenge annual golf tournament at the Columbia Country Club golf course Monday June 25, 2018. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) Whenever a member of Congress is indicted, it’s a good idea to take a long, hard look at their re-election chances. It’s also reasonable to believe their prospects for another term would be diminished and political handicappers would immediately downgrade their race. But it’s not so simple with GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter and California’s 50th District. When New York Republican Chris Collins was indicted a couple weeks ago, we shifted New York’s 27th District from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. It was an acknowledgment that an indictment at least warrants a district be on the list of competitive races. Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., was reportedly arrested on Wednesday. (Al Drago/CQ Roll Call file photo) If Rep. Chris Collins continues to run for re-election, he would do so while facing charges of insider trading and lying to the F.B.I. But just because a member of Congress is indicted, doesn’t mean they can’t win. GOP Rep. Michael Grimm of New York and Democratic Rep. William J. Jefferson of Louisiana are two recent examples of incumbents who won re-election in the face of significant legal problems. Politicians aren’t always to blame for the dysfunction in Congress and the perceived solutions are more complicated than many realize, Gonzales writes. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) After 30 years of covering Congress, David Hawkings has a good idea of how Capitol Hill works — or more important, how it doesn’t — and he laid out five key reasons why Congress is broken. But whether it’s money, maps, media, mingling or masochism, there are no easy solutions. Nor are they entirely the responsibility of the politicians to address. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, faces Democrat Colin Allred in his bid for a 12th term representing the Dallas area. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) In 2010, Texas Rep. Pete Sessions led Republicans to a historic 63-seat gain in the House and a new GOP majority as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Now, he’s at significant risk of losing his own seat. Sessions represents the Dallas-area 32nd District, which Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points in 2016. It’s the type of suburban, college-educated area that has been revolting against President Donald Trump since he took office. But for much of the cycle, Sessions benefitted from a fundraising advantage and a competitive Democratic primary, which was only decided in a May runoff. Students march to the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue to call on Congress to act on gun violence prevention during a national walkout on April 20 to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Gun control has been a third rail of Democratic campaigns, but a new poll suggests that Democratic candidates should embrace a bolder approach to restrictions on guns, even in general elections. Up to this point, Democrats have been decidedly defensive on guns. The most famous instances of Democratic candidates using guns in television ads include West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III shooting the so-called cap-and-trade bill, former Georgia Rep. John Barrow talking about his granddaddy’s pistol and Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander assembling a rifle blindfolded. The ads were meant to reassure voters that Democrats didn’t want to take away their guns. Two men argue over abortion at the Families Belong Together protest outside of the White House Saturday June 30, 2018. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) While recent polling from NBC News/Wall Street Journal showed an uptick in support for Roe v. Wade, other survey data on abortion reflects a remarkably consistent and nuanced approach from Americans on the choice issue that stretches across decades. The recent survey of 900 registered voters, conducted July 15-18, showed 71 percent believe the 1973 decision, which established a woman’s legal right to an abortion, should be kept in place while 23 percent believe the ruling should be overturned. A demonstrator holds a sign at a news conference last week to announce the launch of the Medicare for All Caucus. Health care is a key component of the Democrats’ messaging this fall, Gonzales writes. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) I swore I’d never do it again. In October, I interviewed 16 Democratic House candidates in two days. As much as I enjoy having face-to-face conversations with people running for the offices we cover, it might have been too many in a row. Rating change for New Jersey's 2nd District race: The open seat contest to replace retiring GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo, pictured here, shifts to favor Democrats. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Sometimes political handicapping can be difficult. Shifting a well-liked Democratic senator in North Dakota, who has won a close and competitive race previously, to Tilts Republican from Toss-Up wasn’t an easy decision. But Republican Seth Grossman is making it easy for political analysts. The former Atlantic County Freeholder won the GOP nomination in New Jersey’s 2nd District on June 5, but the National Republican Congressional Committee disavowed him on Monday after multiple offensive statements came to light. “Bigotry has no place in society — let alone the U.S. House of Representatives,” said NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers of Ohio. The Federal Election Commission sent a letter to Club for Conservatives PAC last month with questions about its previously filed reports. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images file photo) Rep. Marsha Blackburn is locked in a competitive and expensive race for Senate. But the Tennessee Republican’s campaign decided to return a sizable contribution from a political action committee that’s facing scrutiny from campaign finance regulators. “Club for Conservatives PAC did not meet our standards for transparency,” Blackburn campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler said.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/hias-pittsburgh-robert-bowers.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By Miriam Jordan When Mazen Hasan had to flee his native Iraq because his work for the American military had drawn threats on his life, it was a Jewish refugee resettlement agency called HIAS that helped him and his family to settle in Pittsburgh. “They did everything they can to help us and make it easy to adjust to a new life here,” said Mr. Hasan, 61, an engineer who arrived in the United States in 2014. HIAS is one of nine agencies with contracts from the State Department to help refugees acclimate to the United States. It has aided immigrants with diverse talents from all corners of the world, including the co-founders of Google and WhatsApp. It is also the target of many anti-Semitic rants posted on social media by Robert Bowers, the suspect in the mass shooting on Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh — including one post published only a few hours before the shooting. Eleven worshipers were killed in the attack. [The mayor called Saturday’s attack the “darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history.”] The agency’s local affiliate, Jewish Family and Community Services of Pittsburgh, met the Hasans at the airport when they arrived, drove them to the apartment that had been arranged for the family and shepherded them through the process of getting Social Security numbers, securing medical care and learning how to get around the city on public transportation. The refugees who receive those kinds of services from the nine resettlement agencies, including the International Rescue Committee and several faith-based groups like HIAS, have all been through extensive vetting by the federal government and have been given clearance to enter and reside in the country. Even so, Mr. Bowers’s writings on social media were bitterly hostile to refugees and to the agency that helped them. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he said in a post hours before the attack. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” In another post, he wrote: “You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us? We appreciate the list of friends you have provided.” Alongside it was a link to information on the National Refugee Shabbat Event, celebrated on Oct. 20 at more than 300 Jewish congregations in 33 states. Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, said the climate of political rancor over immigration gave impetus to the national refugee event. “We felt that at a time when the U.S. is doing less and less for refugees, that we must demonstrate, as a refugee people, that it is more important than ever to continue to welcome refugees as a community,” he said. At a gathering at Congregation Shir Hamaolot in Irvine, Calif., Jackie Menter, a co-founder of the Orange County Jewish Coalition for Refugees, shared her experience working with Middle Eastern and African refugees on the Greek island of Chios last year. She spoke of a Syrian girl who had watched a land mine kill her mother as they were fleeing captivity by the militant group Islamic State, and a man named Mustafa, who returned home to his apartment in the Syrian city of Aleppo to find the entire building bombed out and his wife, children and mother dead. Citing biblical passages about welcoming the stranger, Ms. Menter urged congregants to get involved with HIAS’s efforts to support refugees and asylum seekers. On Saturday night, after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh, she said, “Evil, hatred and racism will not keep justice and mercy from prevailing.” The Trump administration has sharply reduced the number of people fleeing violence and persecution who are admitted to the United States as refugees, lowering the annual ceiling from the 110,000 set before Mr. Trump took office to 45,000 in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and to 30,000 for fiscal 2019. Delays caused by extra levels of screening ordered by the Trump administration — targeting especially people from 11 countries, 10 of them predominantly Muslim — meant that only 22,491 refugees actually arrived in fiscal 2018. Since it began in 1881 in a storefront on the Lower East Side of Manhattan as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, HIAS has assisted millions of people displaced by conflict or persecution, often on account of their religious or political beliefs, to rebuild their lives. Its clients have often been Jews — its first mission was to aid those fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe — but the agency has also helped resettle many other kinds of refugees, including thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians after Communist victories in Southeast Asia in the 1970s. “We used to welcome refugees because they were Jewish,” Mr. Hetfield said. “Today HIAS welcomes refugees because we are Jewish.” [The suspect had shared conspiracy theories about Jews and criticism of President Trump on social media.] The organization played a role in resettling more than 400,000 Soviet Jews who reached the United States, including the families of Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, who came in 1979 when he was 6, and Jan Koum, a co-founder of WhatsApp, who arrived as a teenager about a decade later. “I would have never had the kinds of opportunities I’ve had here in the Soviet Union, or even in Russia today,” Mr. Brin, who has donated to HIAS, said in a 2009 interview. “I would like to see anyone be able to achieve their dreams, and that’s what this organization does.” Rita Sostrin, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles and a former member of HIAS’s board, was once a client. She and her parents, fleeing anti-Semitism, emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987. They were met in Vienna by HIAS representatives who helped them travel on to Rome, where United States officials processed them for resettlement. The family arrived in Minneapolis in 1988. The local HIAS affiliate helped them get on their feet. Ms. Sostrin’s parents found work in their professional fields and she enrolled in college. “Coming to the U.S. is the biggest miracle of my life, and it’s thanks to HIAS,” said Ms. Sostrin, 48, who is married with two children, 11 and 9. In Pittsburgh, Mr. Hasan’s extended family has grown to 16, including married adults with American-born children, two of whom are his grandchildren. “We are happy with the life we have here, which the Jewish agency helped us start,” said Mr. Hasan, who is an observant Muslim. “What happened in the synagogue, this is very bad.” An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one of the resettlement agencies. It is the International Rescue Committee, not the International Refugee Committee.    Advertisement

The youngest victim was David Rosenthal. The oldest was Rose Mallinger, 97. The other victims were: Williams said at a news conference that the victims' families has all been notified and were "are in shock" and "grieving." Friends and loved ones remembered those who were killed as kind, devoted to spiritual life at the synagogue and loving toward one another. Michael Stepaniak, who knew the Simons for decades, told the Tribune-Review that the pair were "a loving couple, and they've been together forever. I hope they didn't suffer much, and I miss them terribly." Myron Snider, a friend of Wax, a retired accountant, described his friend to The Associated Press as "such a kind, kind person." He said Wax was a pillar of the congregation, according to the AP. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," Snider said. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person." Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, told the AP that "the loss is incalculable." Stein and Gottfried made up "the religious heart" of the congregation and would help the rabbi with everything that needed to be done to hold services, Cohen said. Zachary Weiss, whose father was filling in for the rabbi at the Tree of Life congregation, told NBC News on Saturday that his father told him that when the shooting began, it initially sounded like a "car crash." But soon it became clear that they were dealing with an active shooter, Weiss said. "My father was able to make sure that everybody was hidden, whether it's in the back or they were hidden in place," he said, adding that his father went downstairs to check on another congregation. At one point, his father saw shell casings moving, but he didn't get a clear look at the gunman, Weiss said. Weiss said he hoped people would remember the victims, as well the first responders. He called for the city to come together amid the tragedy. "I'm literally seething, and my heart breaks for so many people," Weiss said. Daniella Silva is a reporter for NBC News.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/arts/television/comedy-cellar-tv.html---split---Advertisement Supported by On Comedy By Jason Zinoman As Hurricane Florence headed toward the Eastern Seaboard in September, Ted Tremper, the showrunner for “This Week at the Comedy Cellar,” realized he had a problem, and it wasn’t damage from the storm. He needed jokes. It was the final day of shooting for the test show, and while he had hours of footage of comics weighing in on eight categories (Trump, #MeToo, Colin Kaepernick, etc.), he had no punch lines about Florence. As a former producer of “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” he knew humorous takes on the news needed to stay current. But there was another issue. Some forecasts were suggesting Florence could be catastrophic. As Tremper explained before the first sets of the night, “The challenge is: How do we comment on this without doing a joke in poor taste?” That’s probably not the last time he will have to answer the question of how to successfully shift the context of jokes from the Comedy Cellar, the premier club in New York, to national television. The new show, which made its debut Friday night on Comedy Central, arrives at a critical moment for the Cellar, which has become the subject of controversy just as it tries to expand its empire. The club has been drawing intense criticism since August, when Louis C.K. returned to its stage (among other places) less than a year after having confessed to sexual misconduct. The Cellar was a punch line on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and even at the club itself when the comic Ted Alexandro poked fun at the warm reception Louis C.K. had received. The notoriety has obscured the club’s bid to raise its national profile this year. Based in Greenwich Village since 1982, it opened a branch in Las Vegas, and after a rocky start that included a brief shutdown, it now has an impressive lineup of comics, including many of the names from the New York club. The new television series is an even bolder move by the Cellar’s owner, Noam Dworman, who is not content to stand pat even though his space packs in crowds every night. As dominant as the Cellar is in the New York club scene right now, it’s a fiercely competitive business where reputations rise and fall. The storied Comic Strip Live on the Upper East Side was once the center of the stand-up world, and it now can have trouble attracting audiences. At the same time, streaming services built on the idea that consumers can watch what they want when they want are having trouble figuring out how to make topical comedy work. (See Michelle Wolf, a Cellar comic whose Netflix show was canceled after a short run.) “This Week at the Comedy Cellar” is making a bet on jokes in comedy clubs as the next frontier in topical humor. If the show does well, it would change not just the landscape of late-night television, but also the Cellar itself. Cameras certainly shift the atmosphere in the room, but they also encourage comics to do more newsy material to get on the air. The producers are adamant that they do not tell comics what to say, and while there is some room for evergreen jokes, the focus here is on what is happening now. Dworman said this will make the club better. “The comedians are going to get the hang of it, and it’s going to really inspire some great new material,” he said. “On the pilot, Ryan Hamilton, who doesn’t normally do political stuff, came up with some” that he used for weeks afterward. This isn’t the first Comedy Central show inspired by the Cellar. “Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn,” which ran from 2002 to 2004, was modeled after the conversation at the Cellar’s comic’s table, and included club regulars like Jim Norton, Patrice O’Neal and Greg Giraldo. But that show took place in a studio; “This Week at the Comedy Cellar,” which will feature many more comics, is designed to feel more like a documentary on the club. It will include conversation at the actual table (one of two locations this show will use, along with the nearby Village Underground). “Tough Crowd” ran at a time when the no-holds-barred, often belligerent humor the Cellar is known for was less controversial (and Comedy Central had more cachet). But the Cellar’s reputation as a home to cranky antagonists of the politically correct is a simplification, a broad-brush description of a club that has showcased everyone from Mike Birbiglia to Ali Wong, Hasan Minhaj to Amy Schumer “My mandate is to present the most honest representation of the comics as I can,” Tremper said. Does that include discussion of Louis C. K.? He said yes — and there was one allusion to him in the premiere in a joke by Dan Naturman. The episode was dense with punch lines from young stand-ups, including timely ones about Megyn Kelly’s show getting canceled after she questioned what was wrong with blackface. “It bummed me out because I was planning on going as Bill Cosby for Halloween,” said the comic Sam Morril. “Because that’s how you make blackface the second most offensive part of your costume.” One of Tremper’s partners, Michael Hirschorn, said the show would portray a wide array of views, and the pilot and test runs included a much younger and diverse collection of comics than what you saw on “Tough Crowd.” (While the Cellar is famous for celebrity drop-ins like Kevin Hart and Dave Chappelle, no A-listers appeared on the premiere episode.) When asked how the politics of the Cellar would work on cable, Mr. Hirschorn replied: “I’m comfortable with the level of wokeness here.” Then he laughed. Sitting in a booth at the Village Underground next to a monitor and a guy transcribing every joke told onstage, Hirschorn and Tremper looked tired. They had been shooting film and editing through the night, and Tremper had sneaked in a quick nap. After a few acts, the stand-up Josh Gondelman did some material about being on Twitter in bed at night and getting angry while his wife read. The producers stared ahead, listening, but then became more visibly alert when Gondelman started discussing President Trump’s reference to Hurricane Florence as “tremendously big and tremendously wet.” After pointing out that this sounded like a lyric from an AC/DC song, Gondelman asked: “Is there one thing he can talk about without sounding like he wanted to have sex with it?” Hirschorn looked at Tremper and smiled. “That’s good,” he said. “We needed that.”    Advertisement

---split---2.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trials-texas-biker-fight-prosecutor-starts-58809006---split---A Texas judge has delayed the second trial stemming from a chaotic 2015 shooting outside a Waco restaurant involving rival biker clubs and police that left nine people dead. The decision to postpone the Nov. 5 trial of Timothy Shayne Satterwhite on riot and weapons charges means the year will end without anyone standing trial over the deadliest biker shooting in U.S. history. More than 150 people were indicted following the mayhem at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, but the majority of cases have been dismissed. The only case that went to trial ended last year with jurors deadlocked. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the postponement of Satterwhite's case could indicate it's heading toward a settlement under a new district attorney scheduled to take office in January. ——— Information from: Waco Tribune-Herald, http://www.wacotrib.com
---split---2.0---split---https://www.ap.org/explore/index.html---split---For nearly 170 years, The Associated Press has witnessed war, peace and everything in between. While the world watches, we report. Student-on-student sexual assault is not just a problem on college campuses. It threatens thousands of kids a year in elementary, middle and high schools across America. Rich or poor, urban or rural, no type of school is immune. For the women and girls of Pakistan, “honor” can be deadly. They may be killed for something as simple as a glance at the wrong man, or as life-changing as trying to determine their own future. AP tells their stories. Americans are more divided than ever, gridlocked over social issues, race, gender and the economy. In this series, The Associated Press explores what divides us and how deep those divisions run. In the two years since the Islamic State began building its self-styled “caliphate,” it has killed thousands of people, displaced millions, forced the abandonment of entire villages, and taken over key cities in Syria and Iraq. Here, the AP chronicles the casualties of the IS war. Thailand is the world's third-largest seafood exporter. It's supply chain has been notoriously murky and is staffed largely by poor workers from neighboring regions. Many are tricked or coerced by brokers who sell them onto fishing boats. Sometimes they are even drugged and kidnapped. That's what four AP reporters found during an 18-month investigation into human trafficking and forced labor in Southeast Asia's seafood industry. The investigation started with a simple question: Could the catch from men enslaved on Thai fishing boats at sea be tracked to U.S. households? Forty years after the fall of Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City), Peter Arnett has written a new memoir, “Saigon Has Fallen.” Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the Vietnam War for The Associated Press and later gained fame as a correspondent for CNN. In this vivid recounting, Arnett describes his experience of reporting a war that divided Americans and altered the lives of those who covered it. The Berlin Wall, which had seemed as normal as the rising sun, came down 25 years ago on Nov. 9, 1989. AP’s Vienna Bureau Chief Alison Smale was well-positioned to witness the key moments leading to the fall of the wall. Explore and watch how AP and Smale report the story. “I grabbed that phone when it rang and Ike said, ‘Bob, the president has been shot!’ I said, ‘Ike, how do you know?’ He said, ‘I was shooting pictures then and I saw it.

Explore the historic social movement, through AP’s coverage, leading up to this landmark legislation. Some were locked up when they were as young as 14 or 15, sentenced to life without parole for murder and other serious crimes committed as juveniles. Now dozens of former teen offenders are getting a shot at a second chance after Supreme Court rulings set out the possibility of freedom for these inmates, many now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The court says young offenders should be treated differently than adults. But prison gates don’t just swing open. Presidential hopefuls burn bright, then fade. Poll numbers rise and fall. Presidents pass the torch; administrations change. Through it all, one constant remains: The Associated Press’ coverage of the American president. Once among the richest and safest countries in Latin America, Venezuela is now falling apart. With a plunge in the price of oil and years of mismanagement, the economy is unraveling. Food is scarce. Crime is rampant. Hospitals barely work. And people are fighting desperately just to survive from day to day. The ’60s were powerful days. To say AP reporter Kathryn Johnson was unprepared for plunging into chaotic events is an understatement. She barely begun as a full-fledged Associated Press reporter when the civil rights struggle spread rapidly across the South. From dressing as a student during the integration of the University of Georgia to being trapped in a phone booth by several Ku Klux Klansmen, Johnson's courageous coverage brought the Civil Rights Movement in the south to the AP wires.

I’ve always believed that we should put country before party. Too many politicians practice the reverse, with terrible consequences for the American people. But although I don’t believe in partisanship, I very much believe in the importance of politics and elections. That’s how we make change and progress in a democracy. Over the years, I have supported candidates in both parties who were willing to break with partisanship and the special interests and seek common ground around solutions to make America better. I’ve focused my philanthropy partly around bipartisan gun safety, environmental and immigration reform measures, and my political giving has been focused around those priorities as well. In the last election, for example, I spent nearly ten million dollars to help a Republican, Pat Toomey, get re-elected in Pennsylvania. I disagree with him on many issues. But after the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, he broke with the NRA and co-wrote a bipartisan bill to close the background check loophole. At the same time, I spent roughly the same amount to help successfully elect a Democrat in New Hampshire – Maggie Hassan – who was running to defeat a Republican incumbent who had voted against Toomey’s bill. This year, I'm supporting both Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates who have shown strong leadership on gun safety, the environment, education, and other critical issues facing the country. It’s unusual to support candidates of both parties in a robust way, but that approach has reflected my belief that democracy and government work best when people from both parties work together. There are good people in both parties, and neither has a monopoly on good ideas. I've never thought that the public is well-served when one party is entirely out of power, and I think the past year and half has been evidence of that. Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, have done little to reach across the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions – not only on guns and climate change, but also on jobs, immigration, health care, and infrastructure. As a result, Congress has accomplished very little. In addition, and no less troubling, Congress has essentially stopped acting as a co-equal branch of government, by failing to engage in the kind of oversight of the law that the Constitution requires and the public expects. In fairness, some Republicans have taken their constitutional and legislative responsibilities seriously, like my friend John McCain. But too many have been absolutely feckless, including – most disappointingly – the House leadership. Republicans in Congress have had almost two years to prove they could govern responsibly. They failed. As we approach the 2018 midterms, it's critical that we elect people who will lead in ways that this Congress won’t – both by seeking to legislate in a bipartisan way, and by upholding the checks and balances that the Founding Fathers set up to safeguard ethics, prevent the abuse of power, and preserve the rule of law. And so this fall, I'm going to support Democrats in their efforts to win control of the House. To be clear: I have plenty of disagreements with some Democrats, especially those who seek to make this election about impeachment. Nothing could be more irresponsible. But I believe that ‘We the People’ cannot afford to elect another Congress that lacks the courage to reach across the aisle and the independence to assert its constitutional authority. And so I will support Democratic candidates who are committed to doing both.

---split---2.0---split---https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2018/10/28/players-respond-to-president-trumps-tweet-criticizing-dave-roberts/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text---split---Last night, President Trump tweeted his thoughts on Dodgers manager Dave Roberts’ bullpen strategy. Starter Rich Hill had tossed six shutout innings, but issued a leadoff walk to Xander Bogaerts in the seventh. After striking out Eduardo Núñez, Roberts elected to swap Hill for fellow lefty Scott Alexander, who walked Brock Holt on four pitches. He then brought in Ryan Madson, who has struggled in the World Series thus far. Madson was able to get Jackie Bradley, Jr. to pop out, but then served up a three-run home run to Mitch Moreland that put the Red Sox back in the game. The Red Sox would to on to tie the game in the eighth, then hung a five-spot in the ninth en route to a 9-6 victory. Trump tweeted: Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! During the postgame press conference, Roberts was asked to respond to the tweet. To his credit, Roberts was level-headed about the criticism.

David Price is scheduled to oppose Clayton Kershaw at Dodger Stadium. Here are the lineups each pitcher will face. Red Sox CF Mookie Betts (R) LF Andrew Benintendi (L) 1B Steve Pearce (R) RF J.D.

The Red Sox are hoping Mookie Betts can catch fire. He’s batting just .207 in 66 trips to the plate this postseason. He went hitless in Games 3 and 4 of the World Series and is overall hitting just .211 in the Fall Classic. If the Dodgers are able to stay alive by winning on Sunday night, the two clubs will take Monday off to travel, then play Game 6 on Tuesday in Boston. Game 7, if necessary, would take place on Wednesday. Follow @Baer_Bill

According to postgame comments made by Alex Cora, southpaw David Price will get the ball instead, while Sale will be saved for a potential Game 5 relief appearance and Game 6 start in Boston on Tuesday. Cora didn’t give any specific reason for the change. Per MLB.com’s Ian Browne, he told reporters that the club feels like “David is good tomorrow […] We talked about it before the game, and this is a good spot for David, in a National League park to start a game. Obviously, he’s been throwing the ball well.” Price certainly has turned a corner since he was roughed up in Game 2 of the ALDS and ALCS. In his first start, he lasted just 1 2/3 innings and contributed three runs to the Yankees’ eventual 6-2 win. His second outing was no better — he went 4 2/3 innings against the Astros, but surrendered four runs and four walks in the process. Over his last three appearances, however, he’s laid down back-to-back quality starts and pitched a pristine 2/3 inning in relief, allowing just two runs over 12 2/3 innings. By contrast, Sale hasn’t quite been at his sharpest this postseason. Unforeseen health issues compromised the left-hander’s effectiveness in Game 1 of the ALCS, and he was unable to maintain the pristine command and velocity that was so key to his seventh straight All-Star campaign in 2018. He hasn’t had a truly dominant outing since the Red Sox started their playoff run — in three starts, he’s yet to make it through the sixth inning — though Boston’s electric offense bailed him out during Game 1 of the World Series with an eight-run effort. According to Cora’s comments, Sale isn’t facing any additional health complications and should be ready to go if the Red Sox need a helping hand during the later innings of Sunday’s game. Still, it says something that they’re willing to start Price on three days of rest rather than going with their well-rested ace.  Last night, President Trump tweeted his thoughts on Dodgers manager Dave Roberts’ bullpen strategy. Starter Rich Hill had tossed six shutout innings, but issued a leadoff walk to Xander Bogaerts in the seventh. After striking out Eduardo Núñez, Roberts elected to swap Hill for fellow lefty Scott Alexander, who walked Brock Holt on four pitches. He then brought in Ryan Madson, who has struggled in the World Series thus far. Madson was able to get Jackie Bradley, Jr. to pop out, but then served up a three-run home run to Mitch Moreland that put the Red Sox back in the game. The Red Sox would to on to tie the game in the eighth, then hung a five-spot in the ninth en route to a 9-6 victory. Trump tweeted: Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! During the postgame press conference, Roberts was asked to respond to the tweet. To his credit, Roberts was level-headed about the criticism.

David Blatt was out and Lue was in and that was how LeBron wanted it in Cleveland. LeBron is no longer in Cleveland. Now, neither is Tyronn Lue thanks to owner Dan Gilbert’s quick trigger, a story broken by Shams Charania of The Athletic. Cavs‘ roster has been informed of firing of Ty Lue, per league sources. Lue has been let go as Cavs head coach after 0-6 start to Cleveland’s season. https://t.co/b50Nxh91Br — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 28, 2018  Ty Lue went 128-83 over three years as Cavaliers head coach, helped guiding team to 2016 championship and three consecutive Finals trips.

Tyronn Lue statement obtained by @espn @TheUndefeated pic.twitter.com/Cj7JdsYS12 — Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpearsESPN) October 28, 2018  The Cavaliers also confirmed the move. “This was a very difficult decision. It is especially so, considering Coach Lue’s time with us over the last four years, including four straight trips to the NBA Finals,” said GM Koby Altman in a released statement. “We have respect and great admiration for Ty, not only as a coach, but a person. We thank him for the many ways he has contributed to our success, wish him the best and he will always be remembered for leading a very special Cavs team back against the odds to win the title in 2016. This is a different team equation, though, and one that we felt needed a different voice and approach that required this change.” Larry Drew is the interim coach, although how long that lasts remains to be seen. The Cavs will want him to play the youth and that means losses, he knows he needs to be well compensated and get some security to do that. Drew is a long-time assistant who was the head coach of the Atlanta Hawks for four seasons from 2010-14 plus the head coach in Milwaukee for a short time. The Cavs let go of other assistant coaches and all, including Drew, are on one year contracts. LeBron James and new franchise centerpiece Kevin Love have Lue’s back — speaking for a lot of current Cavs players who are not happy with the move.

Know we will work towards something greater together again. THANK YOU. 🏆 A post shared by @ kevinlove on Oct 28, 2018 at 8:31am PDT No doubt Cleveland has looked like the worst team in the NBA to start the young season, with the second-worst defense and 23rd-ranked offense in the league. They have been outscored by 12.6 points per 100 possessions through six games, trailed by at least 16 in every game, and haven’t shown much competitive fire. Is that really Lue’s fault? The team lost the player that carried them to the Finals, the person that was their team culture, the man the entire roster was built around. Then this summer they didn’t revamp the roster with any kind of direction in mind other than walking the nearly impossible line of rebuilding while winning. While he’s not considered an Xs and Os guru by his peers, Lue is considered a hard-working coach who got a team to a ring with some smart moves. He’s a player’s coach, but only can do so much. Lue is a coach given a misfit roster that was never going to transition smoothly. Some in the Cleveland front office thought could compete for a playoff spot, an idea that drew laughs from most observers. Management thought this team should have been more competitive. Still, the front office was full of mixed signals. They paid big money to Kevin Love this summer — a $120 million contract extension — despite his age and injury history. Love has been fine this season, 19.5 points and 13 rebounds a game, when healthy enough to play, but the roster around him is not going to fit well with his game. What should have been a rebuild after LeBron left has become a team that is neither win now or rebuilding. And it shows. That’s more about Dan Gilbert and his ownership/leadership, which is going to be exposed even more in the coming years. But Lue takes the hit. Welcome to the NBA. Warriors coach Steve Kerr is not afraid to speak out on social issues — military displays at games, Colin Kaepernick, and much more. He understands the megaphone he has as the Warriors’ coach and he wants to use it wisely, but he will not back away from controversial topics. Such as gun control. Before the Warriors game against the Nets Sunday, Kerr was asked about the tragic, anti-semitic motivated shooting at a synagogue in Philadelphia that left 11 dead. Kerr spoke his mind, via Chris Mannix of Yahoo Sports and NBC Sports Boston. “We’re broken right now. So nothing surprises me anymore. Not the shootings at schools, churches, synagogues, malls, movie theaters. We need our leaders to step up and unite the country with the appropriate words and the appropriate actions. And we’re not getting that right now. It’s frustrating. I don’t know what else to say…. “I think you have to feel comfortable talking about whatever issue you’re addressing. Not everybody feels comfortable. Certain situations, circumstances, I think more and more you are seeing people in the sports world, athletes and coaches, speaking out because the times call for it. It’s easy to feel how broken we are right now. Everyone can have influence. Not just our political leaders. People who are either well known figures who have a camera in their face a lot or average citizens just being kind to each other, being nice to one another. Not spewing hatred on social media. Those are all things we have to think about and try to accomplish and get our country back on track.” “And we need to vote. I want to urge everyone to get out and vote November 6th. Everyone has their own issue that is important to them. My personal issue is gun safety. Nobody in this country should have a semiautomatic weapon of war. So I’m going to vote for every candidate that is willing to stand up to the NRA and say you know what, this is insane. We’re murdering each other every day. We have to get rid of bump stocks, we have to get rid of high capacity magazines, we have to get rid of semiautomatic weapons. We just do. Other countries don’t go through this. That is the issue most important to me, those are the candidates I will be voting for. The ones who are willing to stand up and say you know what, this is wrong.” Kerr will get some pushback for this — but not from the Warriors or his players. That is to say, not any constituency that will stop him from speaking out in the future. The people who do complain, Kerr will just shrug off. Besides, what he said is “go vote your issues.” If you have a problem with that concept, you care more about winning than America and democracy. Which is another of the problems this nation is facing. Despite the 2-4 start, the Lakers still won last summer — they landed LeBron James. This is now a franchise back to being a threat to move into contender status, to become a real threat in the West. Just not this season. The Lakers need another superstar (and to figure out who among their young core is ready to make that step up to playing with LeBron). They know it. Team president Magic Johnson knows it. Magic, part owner of the Dodgers, went on the Fox pregame show before Los Angeles blew a 4-0 lead and fell behind 3-1 to Boston in the World Series, and Johnson joked he wasn’t done getting stars to the Lakers. .@MagicJohnson is calling his shot and will get another Superstar! Make it happen, @davidortiz! pic.twitter.com/DSYSoBPUNi — FOX Sports (@FOXSports) October 27, 2018  Lakers fans hope he isn’t joking. It’s also not going to be that easy. While many executives around the league expect Kevin Durant may leave Golden State next summer, he’s doing so to secure his legacy with his “own team” and moving to the shadow of LeBron James does not fit that. (Can you imagine the backlash, after the heat KD got for going to the Warriors, if he teamed up with LeBron next?) Kawhi Leonard‘s people have talked about him wanting to go to Los Angeles next summer, but the Raptors are the hottest team in the NBA early and will have a shot to keep him (they can offer one more guaranteed year and about $50 million more guaranteed as well). Plus, like a lot of reporters around the league, I hear as much or more Clipper talk with Leonard as I do Lakers. The real target may be Anthony Davis, who switched agents to LeBron’s agent Rich Paul and Klutch Sports. A lot of executives around the league think he could be Laker bound — but he has two years left on his current contract. The Pelicans are not going to trade him this season — next July they will put a $240 million designated veteran contract extension in front of him and try to get him to sign it. If he says no, then things get interesting, but the Pelicans still may not trade him, top five players don’t land in New Orleans often and they need to do everything they can to keep him. This may not be a fast process for the Lakers. Tyronn Lue was not hired by Cavaliers GM Koby Altman, he was not the favorite of owner Dan Gilbert. Lue was the guy LeBron James wanted and LeBron James’ winter address is in California now. The Cavaliers fired Lue Sunday morning after a 0-6 start. It was a quick trigger for a coach who has won a ring and was given a roster from the Island of Misfit Toys — a roster built to support LeBron and not revamped with any direction this past summer. The firing led to a lot of people around the NBA shaking their heads. Lue released a classy statement on his way out the door.

A post shared by Channing Frye (@channingfrye) on Oct 28, 2018 at 8:35am PDT The Lakers were down three to the Spurs, 108-105, with just 15.9 seconds left in the game. Which brought up a decision: Do you go for three or get the quick two then foul on the inbound? Most coaches obviously prefer the three, but with that much time on the clock will be good with a quick-hit wide-open layup for two. Put the points on the board. Rajon Rondo went another direction: Huh? With about 12 seconds left, there was plenty of time to play the foul game after a made layup. Here is Rondo’s explanation, via Bill Oram of The Athletic: Rajon Rondo offers his explanation for passing up a wide open layup with about 12 seconds left that would have pulled the Lakers within one point. pic.twitter.com/c4a53XnVIX — Bill Oram (@billoram) October 28, 2018  “I thought I could probably suck somebody in but they did a great job of staying home. The layup would have gotten us one point closer, we’d still have to foul but we didn’t have any timeouts so maybe. I just made a split decision that I made and we didn’t get what we wanted.” The Lakers didn’t lose to the Spurs because of this play alone. Lonzo Ball, who got the start over Rondo, played without the energy we had seen the previous three games he started and went 2-of-8 shooting. Josh Hard was 3-of-10 from the floor. The Lakers had plenty of mental lapses over the course of the game. Rondo’s was just the most glaring and it came in crunch time. It summed up another game where the Lakers had moments but the other team executed better down the stretch and got the win. The bottom line is the Lakers are 2-4 to start the season and still have a lot of work to do.
---split---2.0---split---https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2018/10/28/the-dodgers-loss-in-game-4-is-squarely-on-dave-roberts-shoulders/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text---split---Let us stipulate at the outset that not every loss in a big game is the manager’s fault. Managers’ decisions are more highly scrutinized and second-guessed in October, but not every loss is a function of the levers they pull. Players need to execute and, often, they don’t. When they don’t, we should blame them, not the manager. All of that being said, the Dodgers’ loss in Game 4 of the 2018 World Series should be laid squarely at the feet of manager Dave Roberts. The players he put in a position to secure the game failed to execute, yes, but they should not have been in that position in the first place. Starter Rich Hill was cruising in this game. He had allowed only one hit and had pitched a shutout through six innings when he began the seventh. Yes, he allowed a leadoff walk to Xander Bogaerts, but he came back and struck out Eduardo Nunez and was at 91 pitches. Maybe that’s a lot of pitches these days, but there was no suggestion that Hill was gassed and, after an 18-inning marathon the night before, you’d hope that your 14-year veteran has at least a couple of more batters in him, especially given that the bottom of the order was up. Let Hill get through the seventh, put Pedro Baez and Kenley Jansen in in the eighth and ninth and even up this series. That’s the smart play here, right? But no, for whatever reason, Roberts pulled Hill and put in Scott Alexander, who promptly walked a batter to put two on. And then, even more inexplicably, Roberts called on Ryan Madson to get out of that jam. Which was objectively insane. Madson blew up in the first two games of the World Series, allowing two inherited runs to score in Game 1 and three inherited runs to score in Game 2, costing the Dodgers each of those contests. In light of that it would not have been surprising if Madson had never been seen again. At the very least one would think that, if he was used again, it would be to start an inning when the Dodgers had a lead or in mop-up duty as a means of saving other pitchers’ arms or helping Madson gain his confidence back. When you screw up on the big stage, you have to work your way back. A veteran like Madson knows this and a good manager like Dave Roberts should know it to. Yet Roberts put him in a tough jam for the third time in four games, and Madson crumbled for the third time in four games. The three-run homer he gave up to Mitch Moreland here represented the sixth and seventh inherited run he allowed to score out of his sixth and seventh runners he inherited in this series. That’s a simply remarkable accomplishment. And no, this is not an exercise in hindsight. I and every Dodgers fan I follow groaned when Hill was pulled and groaned even harder when Madson game into the game. When Madson made it 4-3 it was less a matter of shock than it was resignation. The Mitch Moreland homer, obviously, did not end the game, but it all but eliminated any margin for error the Dodgers had. When Kenley Jansen gave up the game-tying homer to Steve Pearce the following inning it was one of those instances of a player not executing I talked about above. Jansen is a guy the Dodgers have to be able to rely on and, for the second straight night, he gave up a dinger when he really needed to not do that. Of course, because of Madson’s previous failure making things so tight, it was a game-changer. It was the top of the ninth when the Red Sox broke things wide open, obviously. A lot of that had to do with the Red Sox simply remembering that they were the Red Sox. Their bats had gone cold for almost all of Game 3 and the first several innings of Game 4, but they were not going to be silent forever. That they put up a five-spot here was a combination of Dodgers pitchers simply not getting the job done and Red Sox hitters showing why Boston had the best offense in baseball all year long. But it was also something enabled by Dave Roberts going to his pen an inning too early, calling on the wrong guys at a critical time, blowing a nice lead and then having nowhere to go when things got tough in the ninth. The better team won. The Boston Red Sox hitters, after a day and a half slump, showed just how dangerous they can be. But it’s not had to imagine things going very differently in this game had Rich Hill been given more rope in the seventh, Ryan Madson never seen the light of day and the rest of the Dodgers bullpen being required to close things out over two innings instead of parts of three. And that, it would seem, is squarely on Dave Roberts. UPDATE: In postgame interviews, Dave Roberts revealed two relevant facts. First: that heading into the seventh inning, Rich Hill had told Roberts to keep an eye on him in case he tires, and that Roberts had never heard that before. Second, Roberts revealed that Pedro Baez was not available tonight, for whatever reason. Some might cite these facts to rebut my charges against Roberts above, but nah, I’m not buying it. For one thing, Hill merely telling Roberts to watch him because he might tire, does not in fact mean that Hill was tired when he was pulled. Indeed, Hill suggested himself after the game that he did not tell Roberts that he was tired at all. For another thing, not having Pedro Baez available, while notable, did not obligate Roberts to put Ryan Madson in a game with two runners on base after he had already cost the Dodgers two games in this World Series already due to failing in such situations. So, no, I don’t think Roberts is off the hook here. Follow @craigcalcaterra Last night, President Trump tweeted his thoughts on Dodgers manager Dave Roberts’ bullpen strategy.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/while-hateful-online-neighbors-say-synagogue-attack-suspect-showed-no-n925281---split---The gunman who allegedly opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue where Sabbath services were taking place on Saturday morning, killing 11 people, left a trail of anti-Semitic posts online, but neighbors said he gave no outward indication of his deadly plans. The attack at the Tree of Life synagogue began sometime before 9:54 a.m., when police were called about an active shooter inside the house of worship in the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which is considered to be a historic Jewish enclave and center for Jewish life in Pittsburgh. Officials said the suspect, identified by authorities and law enforcement sources as Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin, Pennsylvania, was armed with an assault rifle and at least three handguns. The FBI said it appears he entered the house of worship and opened fire and then was confronted by police as he tried to leave. He allegedly shot at police officers in two confrontations as he was exiting the building and then inside and was himself shot multiple times, officials said. Four officers were injured. One officer and another person who was shot were described as being in critical condition. Neighbors said Bowers lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment in a complex called McAnulty Acres, and there was nothing particularly unusual about him. "He was always very quiet. I would very seldom see him," said one 59-year-old neighbor who asked that her name not be used. "He would come and throw the trash away and I would just say hello and that was it." "It's just insane. Who knows what else he was planning?" she added. "I'm in a fog." But online, social media accounts that appear to belong to Bowers contained posts with anti-Semitic messages and hate speech. He apparently made repeated threats to Jews, posted conspiracy theories and made a specific threat against Jews hours before allegedly conducting the attack. Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said that while the investigation is still in its early stages, Bowers did not appear to be known to law enforcement before the shooting. "Certainly, the actions this person took today were hateful," Jones said. "We are in the early stages of this investigation, and over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in this suspect’s life — his home, his vehicle, his social media and his movements over the last several days," Jones said. "I want the people of Pittsburgh to know that the FBI will work around the clock to get them the answers as to why and how this happened," he said. Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the shooting, "and without their courage, this tragedy would have been far worse," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said at a news conference. Scott W. Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, called the attack a “terrible and unspeakable act of hate.” He said it is being investigated as a federal hate crime. Bowers was charged Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, Brady announced. He is also charged with 11 counts of obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and other counts. "The actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity," Brady said Saturday afternoon. "Justice in this case will be swift, and it will be severe," he said. In Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday evening, a crowd estimated to be in the hundreds attended a vigil for the victims amid rainy weather, some holding candles. One person held a sign aloft that read "hate & violence are not the answer." The vigil was organized by students at Taylor Allderdice High School. One of the organizers, senior Cody Murphy, told NBC affiliate WPXI of Pittsburgh that "no one in the community should have to be alone right now" and that "the act of one hateful guy is not going to stop us from spreading love and caring." "It shows that we’re not going to let hate drive us apart," Cody said. "... we’re going to stay together and we’re going to remain the strong Pittsburgh community that I know we’ve always been. And we’re going to continue to love each other."

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-rio-brazil-olympics_us_5786f996e4b08608d332f81f---split---As protests continue throughout the country over the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, the latest African-American men to die at the hands of police, a coalition of Black Lives Matter activists will take their movement to a new place next week: Rio de Janeiro. It’s the latest effort to expand the Black Lives Matter message across the globe, and it comes at an important time. With less than a month to go before Rio hosts the 2016 Olympic Games, the activists hope they can take advantage of the spectacle to highlight the city’s rising levels of police violence and connect with Brazilian activists who are fighting a similar struggle. “Police brutality is global. And Brazil has its own form of ruthlessness,” Daunasia Yancey, the founder of Black Lives Matter’s Boston chapter, told The Huffington Post. “The movement that came before and during and after Ferguson has been really intentional about a global struggle and understanding that our freedoms are all tied to each other.” Yancey, one of the organizers who met with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in October, is part of a coalition of activists that plans to meet with organizations fighting police violence in Rio. The group will also include Rev. John L. Selders Jr. and Pamela Selders, who together led Moral Monday protests against police violence in Connecticut, and other activists who have worked with the Black Lives Matter movement. Their trip to Rio is the work of Elizabeth Martin, the founder of Brazil Police Watch, a Boston-based organization that has sought to draw American attention to police brutality issues in Brazil. Martin formed the organization after Rio police shot and killed her nephew in 2007. She has since organized petition drives that call on the International Olympic Committee and soccer governing body FIFA to work with the Brazilian government to reduce the number of police killings in the country. Last week, Sterling and Castile became the 122nd and 123rd African-American men shot and killed by police officers in the U.S. this year, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. Police also shot and killed 258 black men in 2015, the Post found. A similar survey from The Guardian found that African-American men are nine times more likely to die at the hands of police than members of any other demographic group. But the Black Lives Matter activists who travel to Brazil this month will encounter a comparable and perhaps even more widespread problem in Rio. Brazil is home to some of the world’s deadliest police forces, and escalating violence in the years before the Olympics has only worsened the situation. Police in Rio de Janeiro state have killed more than 2,500 people since the International Olympic Committee chose Rio as the 2016 host in 2009, according to Amnesty International. Police-related shooting deaths increased 40 percent in the state from 2013 to 2014, the year Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup, according to Amnesty’s numbers. They rose yet again in 2015, when police in the state killed 645 people. Seventy-nine percent of the victims of police killings in Rio state between 2010 and 2014 were black men, and 75 percent were between the ages of 15 and 30, according to Amnesty’s figures. More than half of Brazilians claim African heritage, with 7.6 identifying as black and 43.1 as mixed race. “We’re about all black lives,” Yancey said. “For no police violence, for no state murders, of anyone under any circumstance.” ‘They’re killing for you.’ Violence in Rio has recently escalated amid government efforts to regain control of many of the city’s favelas ― the low-income and long-neglected neighborhoods that dot Rio’s landscape and are sometimes controlled by drug gangs. The program, launched just before Rio learned it would become the host of the 2016 Olympics, established Pacifying Police Units ― or UPPs, their acronym in Portuguese ― in neighborhoods like Rocinha, the city’s largest favela. The takeovers often led to violent military and police occupations of many favelas. And though the “pacification” process was initially supposed to include programs that brought basic social services to neighborhoods that had long lacked them, Brazil’s ongoing economic crisis and other factors have gutted the social elements of the UPP program, often leaving occupation and violent interactions with police as their most visible legacy. “The youth don’t walk around here anymore because they know they will be harassed [by the police] anywhere they go,” said Monique Cruz, a resident of Manguinhos favela, where a UPP was installed in 2013, according to news site RioOnWatch.org. “If there are boys who, by some chance, have a police record, they are already stalked by the police and are always accused of committing crimes, besides being black and young.” Black children have overwhelmingly been the victims of the escalation of violence between police and local gangs. A black Brazilian child is the victim of homicide every 23 minutes, according to figures commonly cited by activists, and the number of children and adolescents murdered in Brazil ― the majority of them black ― has doubled in the last 20 years, UNICEF reported last summer. Those deaths are not all the result of police killings. But police were responsible for 1 in 5 homicides in the city of Rio in 2015, according to Human Rights Watch. In October, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child directly linked Rio’s military police to an “elevated number of summary executions of children.” The motivation, the UN body alleged, was an effort to “clean the streets” of street children in order to “present a problem-free city to the world” during the Olympics. Local organizations and activists held protests in Rio last week to remember and draw attention to some of the children who were recently killed. One demonstration dramatically re-enacted the 2015 deaths of five black and mixed-race youths, all between the ages of 16 and 25, who were driving home from a party in Rio’s Morro da Lagartixa neighborhood when police sprayed their car with up to 30 shots (four police officers were arrested, three of them charged with murder). Protestors stage a performance to demonstrate how the five Costa Barros youth were executed, spraying fake blood. pic.twitter.com/zUQ1iIfp5v Another recalled the shooting of Eduardo de Jesus, a 10-year-old boy killed by police while he sat on his front stoop in the Complexo do Alemão favela in April 2015. Mother of Eduardo de Jesus, 10, shot in the head sitting at the doorstep of his house in Complexo do Alemão in 2015 pic.twitter.com/RJ5UtMZVBF But those demonstrations were overshadowed by a group of Rio police officers who staged their own protest in the city’s main airport. The officers, angry that Rio state’s crunched budget has left them unpaid for weeks, stood behind a sign that welcomed incoming travelers with the message, “Welcome to hell!” Another noted that 52 police officers had died in shootouts this year. The message was clear. A month before hundreds of thousands of international tourists would swarm Rio, police officers in one of the world’s most violent cities were warning them: “Whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe.” The security concerns are real. Olympic athletes have been assaulted. Attacks on public buses have increased. In Rio’s North Zone last weekend, angry crowds stormed the streets and stole cars. But activists, human rights groups and security experts worry that the segment of Rio’s population most vulnerable to police crackdowns has been left out of the “security for all” mantra that once defined the city’s regeneration efforts. "The police have confused everything - cellphones and popcorn for guns. They haven't confused one thing: black is black and white is white." Activists like Martin and Yancey see similarities in the attitudes that underlie police brutality in Brazil and the United States. In the name of overall public safety, police in both countries have disproportionately targeted a group of people that they, and society as whole, have deemed undesirable and a threat to that security. And those people ― primarily black, many of them poor and thus easily written off as gangsters, thugs, “bandidos” ― in turn become less safe. “The notion is that the police are keeping people safe,” Martin said. “Well, which people? And safe from who?” Martin wants Rio’s Olympic tourists, especially those from a nation in the midst of its own conversations about police killings, to understand that Rio’s desire to ensure their security has an ugly cost. “If the police are cleaning up ― if they’re killing people ― so that you can go to the Olympics, they’re killing on your behalf,” Martin said. “They’re killing for you, so you can be a spectator at the Olympics.” ‘Everywhere the Olympics goes, state terror follows.’ Facing protests from community organizations and scrutiny from human rights groups, Brazil’s federal and state governments have instituted some reforms to reduce the number of police killings and tackle what human rights groups have called a “culture of impunity” for law enforcement officers who use lethal force. Brazil has increased community policing training, installed cameras on law enforcement vehicles and reduced the use of rifles. Sao Paulo state, which will host Olympic soccer matches, passed laws prohibiting police from driving injured individuals to the hospital so officers would not interfere with a crime scene or even murder the person in transit to cover up a crime. Rio state officials say the number of police-related killings has declined over the last decade, though many admit that there is still work to do. “We need much more training to prepare the police for territories where we still have a lot of difficulty working,” Col. Robson Rodrigues, a retired member of the Rio state police, told The New York Times last year. “Policing activities still need some correcting.” But if the number of police killings in Rio and across Brazil are any indication, reform efforts thus far have fallen short. “This is not a problem that is ignored in Brazil,” said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “It’s just very, very hard to tackle, as the recent and recurring experience in the United States is highlighting.” The Olympics may only make it harder, leaving behind a legacy of violent “pacification” efforts once the three-week party ends and tourists go home. In Rio, 85,000 members of the police and military will be tasked with securing the city during the Olympic Games, and the government has invested heavily in new surveillance and security infrastructure to help. This could all be useful for protecting tourists and athletes. But it might also have demonstrably negative effects on Rio’s poorest residents, who already endure the most scrutiny from law enforcement, especially because that infrastructure tends to remain in place once the Olympics end. “I come to ask that the Olympics do not leave a legacy of tears and blood. But rights and a dignified life,” said Rio resident Ana Paula Oliveira, whose 19-year-old son was killed by police in 2014. Oliveira spoke at an event organized by Amnesty and other human rights organizations to denounce the violence, according to Brazilian news outlet Estadão. “The middle-class and upper-middle-class people will continue to live behind security enclaves that they can afford,” said Kim Schimmel, a Kent State University professor and expert in the security legacies of major sporting events. “The poorer people will be even more at risk.” Yancey shares these worries. She and Boston’s Black Lives Matter chapter organized their own Olympic protests in 2015, when Boston launched a bid to host the 2024 Games. The Olympics could only worsen the problems the city’s black residents are facing, they argued, particularly their relationship with law enforcement. “Everywhere the Olympics goes, state terror follows,” Yancey told HuffPost. It is possible, too, that the Olympics could further limit Brazilians’ ability to demonstrate against such violence. Law enforcement officials violently cracked down on protests across Brazil before the 2014 World Cup, including demonstrations over the disappearance of Amarildo de Souza, a Rio man whose death at the hands of police later led to the arrest of 10 officers. But police could have even more power during the Olympics, thanks to new laws passed by Brazil’s federal legislature in 2015: an “anti-terrorism” bill that activists believe could be used to criminalize public gatherings, and a “General Law of the Olympics” ― essentially required by the IOC ― that Amnesty says puts rights of public assembly and expression even further at risk. Human rights groups’ fears about a lasting reduction of basic rights “are pretty well-founded,” said Pete Fussey, a criminologist at London’s University of Essex who has closely examined the security legacies of that city’s 2012 Olympics. “If you look at the history of Olympic security, that’s pretty much exactly what happens.” “It’s difficult to know what [policies] will remain in place,” Fussey said, “but I think it will increase impunity, reduce accountability and foster an acceptability of an exceptional level of security.” ”There isn’t much one can say right now that’s positive, other than, like in the United States, you have people confronting the issue,” Sotero said. “I hope people use the opportunity of the Olympics to highlight the problem.” That is exactly what the group of activists heading to Rio next week plan to do. Their trip will end on July 23, the 24th anniversary of the Candelaria massacre ― a mass execution of Rio street children that is one of the worst incidents of police violence in Brazilian history. The Olympics will begin in Rio just 13 days later. “This is about the globalization of police brutality,” Martin said. “There’s a job we have as citizens of the world to pay attention to this.” For more Olympic coverage: Meet The Badass 16-Year-Old Boricua Repping The U.S. At The Olympics Here Are The 5 Superhumans Who Just Made The U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Team Meet Simone Biles, America’s New Gymspiration

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Firing of Amber Renee Guyger, who is charged with manslaughter in the deadly shooting of Botham Jean in Jean's own apartment, is premature, according to her lawyer. The family of the man who was fatally shot in his own apartment by a Dallas police officer in September filed a federal lawsuit on Friday. Botham Jean, a 26-year-old black man, was killed at home by Amber Guyger, a white police officer, after she claimed to have mistaken his apartment for her own and took him for an intruder. She was later charged with manslaughter and fired from the force. Both Guyger and the city of Dallas were named in Friday’s suit, which claimed that Guyger used excessive force when she shot Jean. The lawsuit also contends the department did not adequately train Guyger. The police department, the suit alleges, trains its officers to use deadly force even when no “immediate threat to themselves or others" exists. An affidavit prepared by a Texas ranger said Guyger went to the wrong apartment after ending her shift on Sept. 6. The door was ajar, according to the document, and Guyger opened it to find a figure in the dark apartment. She drew her firearm moments later and shot two times, hitting Jean once in the torso, according to the affidavit. Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys for Jean's family, has cast doubt on the narrative. Merritt has said that two independent witnesses told him they heard knocking on the door in the hallway before the shooting. He said one witness reported hearing a woman's voice saying: "Let me in! Let me in!" The Associated Press contributed to this report. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

Bowers, 46, was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in connection with the attack that killed 11 people and injured six others -- including four police officers. Bowers was also charged with 29 federal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and using a firearm to commit murder. He is expected to appear before a federal judge Monday afternoon for formal arraignment. Bowers' alleged assault on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood began at approximately 9:50 a.m., when all three congregations housed in the building were holding Sabbath services. According to the federal affidavit, Bowers was armed with three Glock .357 handguns and an AR-15 rifle. The Associated Press, citing a law enforcement official, reported that Bowers owned the guns legally and had a license to carry them. The state affidavit showed that multiple calls reporting an active shooter were made from the synagogue at 9:54 a.m. The first two officers to arrive on the scene exchanged fire with Bowers, who shot one of the officers in the hand. The other officer received facial lacerations from shrapnel and broken glass. After this initial confrontation, the affidavit said Bowers "retreated further into the [synagogue]." Neither affidavit specified whether any victims were shot after this point or whether the victims had been killed and injured before the initial police response. Stephen Cohen, the co-president of New Light Congregation -- which rents space at Tree of Life and lost three of its members in the rampage -- told the AP that Rabbi Jonathan Perlman shepherded some of the congregants behind a steel door in the basement of the building, likely saving their lives. THE VICTIMS OF THE SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE According to the state affidavit, a Pittsburgh SWAT team entered the building to look for Bowers and recovered a wounded man and woman. The pair were evacuated from the building and taken to a local hospital, where they are listed in stable condition. By that point, the affidavit stated, Bowers had made his way to the third floor of the synagogue. After SWAT team members found him there, the document said Bowers shot two team members multiple times leaving one officer in critical condition. The remaining team members exchanged fire with Bowers, eventually wounding him and capturing him. During this period, according to the federal affidavit, Bowers "repeated comments regarding genocide, his desire to kill Jewish people, and that Jewish people needed to die." He also accused Jews of "committing genocide to my people," a comment that echoes those Bowers is believed to have made on the social media site Gab. OPINION: I PRAYED AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE In a post made Saturday morning, a man with Bowers' name directed his ire toward the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a nonprofit organization that provides aid to refugees. Bowers said: "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Pittsburgh's professional sports franchises honored the victims of Saturday's deadly mass shooting at a synagogue with a moment of silence and plans for a blood drive and donation collection. The Steelers observed a moment of silence before Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns at Heinz Field, which is approximately seven miles west of the Tree of Life Synagogue, where a gunman killed eight men and three women during services. In a tribute to the victims, a tweak to the Steelers' distinctive logo changed a yellow shape into a Star of David and added the words "Stronger than hate." The image appeared on social media Saturday and at least one child in the stands wore that logo as a patch on his jersey. In a statement issued before Sunday's game, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." The Pittsburgh Penguins announced the team would host a blood drive on Monday and collect donations from fans attending Tuesday's home game against the New York Islanders. A moment of silence will be held before the game and the team announced that the previously planned Halloween theme for the game would be canceled. "The Pittsburgh Penguins join the greater Pittsburgh community in standing up against this senseless violence and supporting the victims and families of the Tree of Life Synagogue,” said David Morehouse, president and CEO of the team. “Under these circumstances, we determined it was not appropriate to continue with our annual Halloween theme on Tuesday, so those activities have been cancelled. The entire city has a heavy heart." The club also announced that the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation would donate $25,000 to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh and another $25,000 to establish a benefit fund with the city's Department of Public Safety for the four Pittsburgh police officers injured in Saturday's shooting. A moment of silence also was held before the Penguins' road game against the Vancouver Canucks Saturday evening, which Pittsburgh won 5-0. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump refuted reports on Thursday that – despite warnings from the intelligence community – his continued use of a personal cell phone has enabled foreign spies to listen. Yet leading experts in the security and the intel arena concurred that such breaches are highly plausible and far more wide-reaching than what meets the eye, or the ear. Melvin Wax was the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 7 a.m. A caravan of Central American migrants attempting to reach the U.S. border took a rest break on Sunday, stopping in Tapanatepec, Mexico. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a tribute to the Jewish community of Pittsburgh following Saturday’s mass murder at a Pennsylvania synagogue, allegedly by a gunman who expressed hatred of Jews as he opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and later told police, “All these Jews need to die.” Supporters of Republican Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona carried signs referencing Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema's past comments. The deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday prompted one man to create a special twist on the Pittsburgh Steelers logo. In a city known for its Jewish population, the neighborhood was the faith's spiritual heart and the synagogue a cornerstone of the community. Maj. Gen. Mark McQueen had no sooner retired from the Army -- after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and started his job as city manager in Florida's Panama City when it was slammed by Hurricane Michael.

(AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena) A Sri Lankan woman walks past a notice board covered with posters carrying portraits of President Maithripala Sirisena and newly appointed Prime Minster Mahinda Rajapaksa at a street in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. Sri Lanka's president suspended Parliament even as the prime minister he fired the previous day claimed he has majority support, adding to a growing political crisis in the South Asian island nation. Posters read " Our respect for the decision took on behalf of the country." (AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena) COLOMBO, Sri Lanka – Sri Lanka's president said Sunday that the main reason he decided to sack his prime minister was the alleged involvement of a Cabinet minister in a plot to assassinate him. In a televised address to the nation, President Maithripala Sirisena said a person questioned by investigators had revealed the name of a minister in an alleged plot to assassinate him and a former defense secretary. He said the only choice for him under the circumstances was to dismiss Ranil Wickremesinghe and invite his former nemesis and ex-strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa to take over as prime minister and form a new government. "This information (received by investigators) contains a number of details hitherto hidden to the people," Sirisena said. "The informant has made a statement regarding a Cabinet minister involved in the conspiracy to assassinate me." He did not reveal the name of the minister. Even though Sirisena's supporters had been talking about an alleged plot to assassinate him for weeks, Sunday was the first time Sirisena had made a public statement on it. Meanwhile, one person died and two others were wounded on Sunday in a shooting at the Petroleum Ministry, in the first violent incident since the political turmoil began on Friday with the sacking of Wickremesinghe. Pushpa Soyza, a spokeswoman at Colombo National Hospital, said three people were admitted to the hospital following the shooting, and one of them had died. Arjuna Ranatunga, who was petroleum minister under Wickremesinghe, said one of his security guards opened fire when Rajapaksa supporters mobbed him and protested against him entering the ministry premises. Wickremesinghe has called Sirisena's move to sack him unconstitutional and said he can prove his majority support in Parliament. On Saturday, Sirisena suspended Parliament in an apparent move to give Rajapaksa time to try to muster enough support to survive any no-confidence vote. The speaker of Parliament urged Sirisena to safeguard Wickremesinghe's rights. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in a letter to Sirisena on Sunday that the continued suspension of Parliament would have "serious and undesirable consequences." Opposition lawmakers, supporting the new prime minister, asked Wickremesinghe to vacate his official residence or face a forcible eviction. Hundreds of Wickremesinghe supporters continued to gather outside his official home on Sunday for the second consecutive day, waving party flags and denouncing Sirisena and Rajapaksa. Buddhist monks performed religious rites to invoke blessings on Wickremesinghe. Jayasuriya said in the letter that he received "a request to protect the rights and privileges" of Wickremesinghe "until any other person emerges from within Parliament as having secured the confidence of Parliament." He said the request came from two senior lawmakers from the sacked prime minister's party. "This request is especially important in the context where various persons are reported to have issued threats via the media," Jayasuriya said, adding that "the forcible takeovers" would have "serious international implications." Tensions have been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of some of the economic reforms being introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war, which ended in 2009.

One congregation leader said their training in active-shooter situations had helped save lives. When the suspect was detained after a shootout, he reportedly told Swat officers he wanted "all Jews to die". The 11 victims were named on Sunday and included a husband and wife, and a woman aged 97. Another six people were injured, including four policemen. Mayor Bill Peduto said that this was the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history". The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 criminal charges over what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. He is still in hospital being treated for multiple gunshot wounds but is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Three congregations were reportedly meeting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill district of Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Members of the New Light congregation were meeting in a basement area, Carl Solomon, 81, a congregation member who turned back from the synagogue but had spoken to survivors, told the New York Times. Richard Gottfried, 65, and Daniel Stein, 71, were in the kitchen and both were shot dead. Congregation co-president Stephen Cohen told the paper there was "no place to hide" there. He said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman had shepherded two other people into a storage room, although one, Melvin Wax, 88, chose to later open the door and was shot dead. Mr Cohen said "everyone froze but Rabbi Perlman". He told the Associated Press news agency that leaders had taken part in active-shooter drills "and I think that's what ultimately saved the people who were saved". Worshipper Joseph Charny, 90, said he saw a man appear at the door and heard shots. He told the Washington Post: "I looked up and there were all these dead bodies." He said he and two others hid in an upstairs storage room until it was safe to come out. They were named on Sunday as Joyce Fienberg, 75; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his brother David, 54; married couple Bernice Simon, 84, and Sylvan Simon, 86; and Irving Younger, 69. Tributes have been pouring in from those who knew the victims. Myron Snider described his friend Melvin Wax as a "sweet, sweet guy" and unfailingly generous. Ben Schmitt, a patient of Jerry Rabinowitz, said the family medical practitioner was "kind and funny... [he] completely personified the term 'bedside manner'". Cecil and David Rosenthal were described as "kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around". One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another was due to be released on Sunday, with the other two needing more treatment. By Hugo Bachega in Pittsburgh All day during a cold, grey Sunday, residents and others brought flowers and candles to the entrance of the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Jewish life in Pittsburgh. There were words of disbelief and a common determination that they would not allow this tragedy to change such a vibrant place. "You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole," said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. At an evening vigil at a local hall, hundreds gathered inside, dozens more outside in the light rain, to say this was an attack not only on one community but on their entire city. The message: "Love will defeat hatred, light will defeat darkness." He was armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He owned them legally, a law enforcement officer told the Associated Press. Officers arrived after receiving calls about an active shooter at 09:54 local time (13:54 GMT) on Saturday and encountered the suspect as he was trying to leave. The gunman fired at them and ran upstairs. As Swat officers searched for victims, the gunman opened fire on them and injured two. The suspect was detained after being wounded in an exchange of fire with officers. Officials said the gunman had made statements regarding genocide as well as a desire to kill Jewish people. There are few details about Robert Bowers but there is a trail of anti-Semitic comments on social media. His neighbour, Chris Hall, told AP: "The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed." Officials said there was nothing to indicate he had any accomplices. FBI special agent Robert Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. The 29 charges were announced in a statement issued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: He described the gunman as a "maniac" and suggested the US should "stiffen up our laws of the death penalty". "These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop," he said. Mr Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh soon and had ordered US flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast until 31 October. He added that the shooting had "little to do" with US gun laws. "If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation." But Mayor Peduto, a Democrat, said: "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder." The controversial candidate wins a big victory over his left-wing rival in the presidential election. 15 sayings from around the world

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Authorities confirm 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue and six people injured, including four police officers; Jackie Heinrich reports. Reportedly shouting “all Jews must die,” a gunman killed 11 people and wounded six others, including four police officers, as a tragic and gruesome crime scene unfolded Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue. FBI special agent Bob Jones, who’s been with the FBI for 22 years, called the scene of the anti-Semitic attacks at the Tree of Life Synagogue “the most horrific crime scene I have seen.” Robert Bowers, 46, was arrested at the shooting scene after he was wounded and was charged Saturday night with 29 criminal counts. The attack illustrates the prevalence of anti-Semitism in our country. Speaking to farmers in Indianapolis, President Trump called for unity following the shooting and labeled the attack "pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable.” He denounced anti-Semitism unequivocally saying that “there must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America.” At a campaign rally in Illinois, the president addressed the attack and said that "the evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us.” He also said it has to be "confronted and condemned everywhere it rears it very ugly head.” Violence in all forms needs to be confronted and condemned. The problem is that for far too long, anti-Semitism has neither been confronted nor condemned. Instead it’s been ignored. If nothing else, hopefully this harrowing, monstrous act against an innocent Jewish community opens our eyes as a nation to the reality that anti-Semitism is alive and well in America. We can no longer plead ignorance to its existence. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) promotes itself as an advocacy organization that monitors hate groups and extremists. Except the group is more concerned with hate directed at Muslims than at Jews. When it came to monitoring the extremism and hate that perpetrated more than 1,700 acts of anti-Semitism at American colleges and universities from 2015 to 2017 – crickets from the SPLC. Likewise, there were crickets from Democrats when Louis Farrakhan made his latest pronouncement of anti-Semitism just last week, comparing Jews to termites. Facebook took down video of Farrakhan saying: “So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, call me anti-Semite. Stop it. I’m anti-Termite,” Twitter allowed the anti-Semitic comment to stand and continued giving it a platform. Violence in all forms needs to be confronted and condemned. The problem is that for far too long, anti-Semitism has neither been confronted nor condemned. Instead it’s been ignored. If that’s not bad enough no one in the Democratic Party, nor many of our leading media personalities, felt it necessary to condemn Farrakhan’s hate speech. The Democrats haven’t historically been lining up to stand in solidarity with Israel either. In 2015 when then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak before Congress, 56 Democrats staged a boycott of his speech. Among those turning their backs on the leader of one our closest allies were then-future Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; then-future Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.; likely future presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, and others. It’s one thing to note someone’s controversial words and rhetoric, but boycotting Netanyahu’s address to Congress was an action. Actions, as we all know, speak louder than words; words resonate, but actions resonate even more deeply. These are leaders of the Democratic Party, and they have a track record of not supporting Israel. America, we have a problem. First lady Melania Trump tweeted: “My heart breaks over the news out of Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America.” Yes, we do need to unite – all races, religions and political persuasions. We all must come together and denounce all hate and violence, toward all groups of people. That includes Jews and that includes the Jewish state of Israel. Hate has no place in our country. It’s time we all condemn all of it, without prejudice, unequivocally in all forms. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

I learned about Saturday’s mass murder of 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue while traveling in Austria with a group of 150 Jews from around the world. We are headed for the site of the infamous Mauthausen Concentration Camp, where more than 90,000 Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. I am among the leaders of the Simon Wiesenthal Center traveling with the group to the former death camp. On Sunday we will unveil a plaque honoring Wiesenthal, who devoted much of his life to finding and bringing to justice Nazi war criminals who took part in Hitler’s Final Solution, which was designed to rid the world of the Jewish people. We are going to lay a plaque at the Mauthausen site, now preserved as a memorial to those who died at the camp. The plaque bears a quotation from Wiesenthal: “Hope Lives When People Remember.” Wiesenthal lost 89 members of his family at the hands of the Nazis. He was too weak form starvation to even stand when U.S. soldiers burst through the gates of Mauthausen in May 1945 to liberate the camp and save him and other prisoners from what seemed like certain death. The murders Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh came during what was supposed to be a joyous ceremony, a brit milah (circumcision) welcoming an 8-day-old baby boy into Abraham’s fold. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting "likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States." Sadly, we are not shocked by the attack in Pittsburgh. History’s oldest hatred doesn’t always garner headlines when it rears its ugly head in the United States, despite the fact that FBI statistics annually confirm that African-Americans are the first target of race-based hate crimes and American Jews are by far the first target of religious-based hate. We aren’t shocked because in 1999, Buford Furrow – a white supremacist and anti-Semite – loaded his van with munitions and explosives and drove from Oregon to Los Angeles. Furrow’s target was the place where I work, the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance. By his own admission, it was our security inside and outside our facility that sent him scurrying to find a soft Jewish target. And he did – wounding children at a Jewish day camp and then gunning down a Philippine-American U.S. postal worker. Tragically, on this quiet Shabbat in Pittsburgh there was no security guard. But it is not clear if the domestic terrorist who killed the 11 Jews and wounded six other people, including four police officers, could have been stopped by anyone. While the hate hasn’t changed since 1999, a few things have. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting "likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States." First and foremost, social media. The man accused of being the Pittsburgh shooter was reportedly very active on Gab – a favorite with extremists from the alt-right, where he has regularly spouted virulent anti-Semitic invective. The empowerment and validation supplied by the world’s most powerful marketing tool will certainly emerge as a key sustainer long-standing hatred. Second, anti-Semitic hate is increasingly accepted without a whimper in many Western democracies, including in Europe. In many capitals – including Paris, London, Copenhagen, Stockholm – it is dangerous for Jews to wear a kippah (skullcap) or a Star of David necklace, lest they be harassed or worse by neo-Nazis or Islamist extremists. Third, anti-Semitism is the mother’s milk of anti-Israel propaganda from Iran and from the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Nearly 40 percent of Norwegians and millions of other Europeans have come to believe that Israelis treat Palestinians the way Nazis treated Jews. These attitudes have been incorporated by some churches and on many U.S. campuses, with resulting increases in hate crimes and intimidation of Jewish students. Fourth, the United Nations convenes a meeting condemning anti-Semitism once a year. Too bad the other 364 days a year are used by the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, and the U.N. General Assembly to condemn the Jewish state and its supporters. The heroics of outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley in condemning the double standard against the Israel are deeply appreciated by American Jewry, but too often she was a lone and lonely voice. President Trump has also put the U.N. and its agencies on notice that they must change their behavior or risk losing even more American financial support. President Trump denounced the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. But he must do more. We urge him to convene a meeting of religious leaders across the social and political divide to address the hate. We need real leadership from both political parties to stop our societal slide before it is too late. On this issue, we should all be able to unite, regardless of our political differences. At Mauthausen on Sunday, I will speak about U.S. Army Col. Richard Siebel from Defiance, Ohio. He served as the commanding officer at the newly liberated Mauthausen Camp. He replaced the flag of the German Third Reich with another flag, secretly sewn by the inmates in the weeks leading up to liberation. The prisoners sewed the American flag. It had 13 stripes, but none of the prisoners knew exactly how many states there were in the U.S. So they sewed 56 stars. Never mind. It was the idea and ideals of what America stood for that gave them hope to hang on another hour, another day, another week. That flag today is on display at our Museum of Tolerance. Let’s hope that Americans of all races, religions, and political persuasions will connect with America’s true greatness and bottomless potential for good.

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports) A day after the Los Angeles Dodgers lost Game 4 of the World Series, starter Rich Hill denounced President Trump's critical tweet questioning the Dodgers' strategy. He said Trump should be more concerned with Saturday's shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue rather than decisions made by Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. “There was a mass shooting yesterday," he told reporters. "The focus, in my opinion, of the president is to be on the country, and not on moves that are made in a World Series game.” Trump was scorned for tweeting about the World Series hours after the synagogue massacre, and he was accused of insensitivity. “Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings,’’ Trump tweeted. “It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake!’’ Hill, 38, pitched six innings of one-hit ball before Roberts went to his bullpen. The Dodgers lost to the Boston Red Sox, 9-6, after having a 4-0 lead in the sixth inning. Roberts’ decision to use reliever Ryan Madson in the seventh ignited the Red Sox rally. Said Roberts after the game when informed of Trump's criticism: "I'm happy he was tuning in and watching the game. I don't know how many Dodger games he's watched. I don't think he is privy to the conversation. That's one man's opinion." Follow Boeck on Twitter @scott_boeck Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings.

But the death toll would have been much lower had the synagogue hired an armed guard, he claimed. Twitter imploded. If the Tree of Life synagogue had an “armed guard inside ... they would have been able to stop them,” Trump told reporters. “Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him,” he added, referring to suspected gunman Robert Bowers. The gunman was armed with an assault rifle and handguns, according to police. Twitter responses slammed Trump for blaming the synagogue for failing to have a guard, and pointed out that four of the six people wounded in the attack were police officers, all armed. They scorched him for his outright refusal to consider how gun laws affect gun violence in America, and for his apparent aim to put even more firearms in people’s hands. But what drove Twitter users particularly bonkers was the idea of armed guards in places of worship. Trump says Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh has “little to do with” gun laws, says the synagogue should have “had some kind of a protection” inside the temple, and later blames synagogue for not having armed guards. pic.twitter.com/AWg5AwkEKp And he never mentioned the victims... Yeah, I'm sure that's the message the churches want to communicate.. pic.twitter.com/8noo57AQAA Yes...bc you of course want guns at a bris. Rabbis with rifles. That's the answer And why stop there. Pastors with pistols. Kids with carbines. Oldies with oozies I would rather place restrictions on who can buy the weapons of war than live in a country where we have to arm teachers and rabbis. Oh yes. So it's the victims' fault yet again. Armed trained police were shot. I’m sure guards would have done so much better. @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump The police were located right around the corner, arrived in one minute, and three of them were shot. The problem is that the killer had an #AssaultWeapon. That's why he killed 11 people before armed police could stop him. #BanAssaultWeapons! Be #ProLife Somebody needs to tell our NRA-bought president that there were armed guards at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Pulse, the high schools in Parkland and Santa Fe, etc. A deranged civilian w/an AR-15 and a death wish will always overpower security guards. What we need is #GunControlNow. @POTUS Really? The guy had an AR-15 style war weapon. What good would a guard at the door done? This is most assuredly a gun issue. How did the guy get a weapon of war? That’s what he wants America to become. Everywhere you go, schools, work, grocery store, place of worship will have armed guards. 😢 #NotInMyAmerica Dystopia. I want less guns. I blame the shooter and anyone who defends having more guns. ANOTHER mass murder event with an AR-15 used. This weapon could be moved to Class 3 weapon status TODAY and would be off store shelves TOMORROW. It could be done with a simple written directive to BATFE to classify the AR-15 as a "Destructive Device" which it obviously is. After getting $30 million from the NRA, Trump will advocate more guns for everyone, probably schoolkids too. My sister lives near there. She had to abandon her car when this happened. She was impressed by the quick action of the police & others. She was horrified by the words of @realDonaldTrump . She says the area is “ a war zone.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-the-left-does-not-understand-about-hunters---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. (istock) Forests are now awash with an impressionist’s pastels across much of the Northern US. Soon the color will drip as fallen leaves to the forest floor and it’ll seem like the Robert Frost poem “October,” (O hushed October morning mild; Thy leaves have ripened to the fall…) is being whispered by the wind. To hunters this is the call of the wild. Bird hunters see the colored forests and dream of walking into upland cover behind their spaniels and retrievers. Deer hunters feel the cool air and smell the fallen leaves and know it is time. Waterfowl hunters see ice edging creeks and ponds and know cold air in the north will send the ducks and geese south. Hunters don’t see this with cold calculation, but with a love of the outdoors and the game they hunt and consume. Yes, love. Those who don’t hunt can have trouble understanding this. The contradictions seem too obvious. How can you kill what you love? Partly this misunderstanding is hunters’ fault. Though we’re seduced by the natural splendor and lobby for wildlife conservation and pay taxes that fund much of the conservation in the US, we’re careful how much we talk about this. Articulating Aldo Leopold’s brand of environmental ethics openly and with our hearts on our sleeves just isn’t manly. We can’t tell people, even other hunters, we love the game we hunt. They would think us effeminate, soft-headed or something. And that’s part of our weakness. Still, I’ve seen hunters tear up when their sons or daughters tag their first pheasant or deer. I’ve seen similar emotion shown by hunters in hunting camps, at state game department meetings, at meat processors and taxidermists. I once saw the toughest guy I ever knew kneeling down, balling like a child when he found one of his hounds dead on a road. I live along a rural-urban cultural divide in New York State and so see people misunderstanding each other on this topic whenever it comes up in mixed company. I have neighbors who moved north from Brooklyn who are frightened of hunters. They called the police when they first moved upstate. A neighbor who lives a half-mile away likes shooting clay birds, built his own sporting clays course on his property. My neighbors thought there was a shootout going on. The cop who responded told them, “Oh, that’s just Bill. Welcome to the country.” They were shocked when they learned I hunt. I shop at the same farm stands they do. I understand and respect their perspective. In my view, they simply have a few things to learn about what is really good for the environment in the forest around their home. I showed them the browse line – where the deer have eaten away the understory of the forest – on the acres they own and explained how important it is for the sake of biodiversity to control the deer population. They’ve been polite and neighborly, but we still talk past each other on environmental topics. When I told them I have hunted all over the lower 48 and in many Canadian provinces, and that, wherever I travel, I always find that hunters love what they hunt, they looked baffled. I told them when they see a pickup truck parked in autumn along a rural road, realize that a man or a woman (more women are now hunting than ever before) is out there trying to earn their own meat and this isn’t a bad thing. If the hunter is following game laws – as the vast majority do – then they are being used as a tool by wildlife biologists to control deer and other game populations and to pay as they go. I’ve told them hunters pay Pittman-Robertson taxes when they buy guns and ammunition and that last year about $800 million was raised from these taxes and sent to the states for conservation programs. Another $350 million was raised in 2017 from similar taxes on fishing equipment. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for firearms manufacturers, estimates that, on a daily basis, about $3.5 million is contributed through taxes on guns and ammo and hunting license fees to wildlife conservation. The meat hunters bring home is eaten. Go to any local meat processor on or after opening day of deer season to see all the hunters coming in to drop off their deer and to tell the butcher how they want the meat cut up for their table. The wild meat is also “green,” as it is free-range, hormone-free and hasn’t been genetically messed with by man. I’ve told my neighbors that each year I toy with restricting myself to only eating meat I actually kill, as I almost do that anyway. I don’t because, like most, I enjoy variety; still, we must respect where our sustenance comes from and securing meat with your own hands and wits does engender deep respect. As I said, from these experiences comes love. When we chat about such things I see in them an ignorance made possible by the mainstream media’s treatment of the millions of Americans who hunt. The media has mocked President Donald J. Trump’s sons for being hunters and has even treated them, and other hunters, as if they are bloodthirsty killers. It is a tragedy that the environmental community, and thus the progressive left, won’t treat hunters as the conservationists they are. They don’t because they view hunters as a political constituency that more often votes for Republicans. Hunting, after all, is a practical sport, real experiences in an increasingly virtual world, and reality has a way of creating conservatives.

The man arrested for the pipe bombs, Cesar Sayoc, was living in a van plastered with photos of the president and images of some of the Trump targets with gunsight crosshairs over their faces. Pirro, referring to the weeks’, asked Eric Trump “is this a sign of the rhetoric and the outrage people are hearing? Is there any correlation between the two?” “Listen, there might be, and there might not be,” he responded. “At the end of the day, this is a very sick, sick, deranged human ... subhuman,” he said, referring to suspected synagogue shooter Robert Bowers. Trump also complained that “it seems like we’ve gotten to a place in life and society where everything has to be kind of politicized ... Somebody has to point a political finger at absolutely everything. At the end of the day, this is a sick, sick, sick person.” Check it out in the interview above.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption People pay their respects in front of a memorial on Sunday outside of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after a shooting there on left 11 people dead. Updated at 4:03 p.m. ET Eleven people were killed on Saturday when a gunman entered Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and opened fire on the congregants. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97; eight were men, three were women. Two of them were brothers, and two were a married couple. Chuck Diamond was a rabbi at Tree of Life until about a year ago, and he remains a member of the community, living just around the corner from the synagogue. He knew many of the victims. "These are wonderful people, good souls, who were just coming to synagogue as the usually did," he told NPR on Sunday. "Synagogue was just getting started and mostly elderly people who come there are there at the beginning, and you could count on them every week for coming. ... It's such a crime that their lives were taken from us." But he said the city's residents are coming together to support one another after the tragedy. "Pittsburgh," he said, "is a wonderful community. It's not only a wonderful Jewish community, it's just a wonderful community." The names of the victims were released on Sunday morning by the Allegheny County Office of the Medical Examiner. Here are some of their stories, as we learn them. Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill, was the oldest of the victims. Diamond told NPR that Rose "was in her 90s, but she was one of the younger ones among us, I have to tell you, in terms of her spirit. Rose was wonderful." Daniel Stein, 71, lived in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. He is the former president of the New Light Congregation, a Conservative synagogue that held services at Tree of Life. He was remembered for his kindness. "He was always willing to help anybody," his nephew Steven Halle told TribLIVE, formerly the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. "He was somebody that everybody liked, very dry sense of humor and recently had a grandson who loved him." Melvin Wax, 88, also of Squirrel Hill, was a remembered as a pillar of the New Light Congregation. "He was such a kind, kind person," his friend and fellow congregant Myron Snider told The Associated Press. "When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them." "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." Snider said Wax was a bit hard of hearing, and unfailingly attended Friday, Saturday, and Sunday services, filling in at nearly every role if someone didn't show up. "Just a sweet, sweet guy," he said. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough, was a family doctor. He practiced in a "small, cozy office in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield neighborhood," TribLIVE reporter Ben Schmitt wrote in a personal remembrance. Rabinowitz was his father's doctor, and his own. Jerry Rabinowitz in 2013. Courtesy of the family hide caption Jerry Rabinowitz in 2013. Schmitt recalled how his father became ill on a trip to India, and called back to Rabinowitz in Pittsburgh for advice. The doctor called his father every day for the rest of his trip to check in on his health. "I felt like I was in such competent, caring hands," Schmitt's father said. "Such a kind and gentle man." Rabinowitz also was the personal physician to former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Lawrence Claus, who released a statement on Sunday remembering him. "Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... was truly a trusted confidant and healer who could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor," said Claus, according to CBS affiliate KDKA. "He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best." Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54, were brothers who shared an apartment in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Raye Coffey, a close friend and former neighbor of the Rosenthals' parents, told TribLIVE that the Rosenthals spent a lot of time in her house when they were younger. She said the brothers faced mental challenges and were fixtures at Tree of Life, where Cecil was a greeter. "Cecil was always a big brother. He was very warm and very loving. Whenever he would see us, he would always say, 'Hi, Coffeys!' " "David was quieter," she said. "But both were ... to die like this is horrendous." ACHIEVA, an organization that works with people with disabilities said that the brothers were well-respected members of its community. Chris Schopf, who runs the group's residential programs, said the brothers never missed a Saturday at Tree of Life. "If they were here they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be," Schopf said in a statement. "Cecil's laugh was infectious. David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable. Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Cecil and David Rosenthal will be remembered as the thoughtful, caring people they were, bringing love and laughter to those around them. https://t.co/fdzXqfM7It pic.twitter.com/vnq1tcPPQ2 Bernice Simon, 84, and Sylvan Simon, 86, of Wilkinsburg were remembered by neighbors as sweet, kind, and generous. They were married at the Tree of Life synagogue in December 1956, according to TribLIVE. "A loving couple and they've been together forever," longtime friend and neighbor Michael Stepaniak told the news site. "I hope they didn't suffer much and I miss them terribly." Joyce Fienberg, 75, lived in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, and grew up in Toronto. She had two sons and was remembered as a proud grandmother. "[She was] the most amazing and giving person," her brother, Bob Libman, told the CBC. Fienberg was a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center for more than 25 years. In a statement on Sunday, the center called her "a cherished friend" and "an engaging, elegant, and warm person." Gaea Leinhardt, professor emerita at Pitt, called Fienberg her best friend and told The Washington Post that she had a way of putting teachers at ease when she visited their classrooms. "She was very intellectual," Leinhardt said. "But also people would just always open up to her in a very easy way. She was an ideal observer." Her husband, internationally celebrated statistician Stephen Fienberg, died in 2016. Leinhardt told the Post that Fienberg had been especially involved at Tree of Life since her husband's death. "I just can't say how terribly sad I am that this person isn't in the world anymore." Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township, shared a dentistry practice with his wife. The two met as dental students at the University of Pittsburgh, the Post reports, and they volunteered with Catholic Charities' dental clinic. He was said to be an avid runner and had been going to services at Tree of Life more often recently. Irving Younger, 69, ran a real estate business in Squirrel Hill for many years, and was also a youth football and baseball coach. Tina Prizner, who lived next door to Younger in the Mt. Washington neighborhood, remembered him as "the most wonderful dad and grandpa" and as a devoted member of his congregation. "He went every day. He was an usher at his synagogue, and he never missed a day," she told TribLIVE. "He was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul." NPR's Cameron Jenkins contributed to this report.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.npr.org/2018/10/28/661530860/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims-identified---split---Shannon Van Sant Officials are treating Robert Bowers' attack on the Tree of Life Congregation as a hate crime. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Officials are treating Robert Bowers' attack on the Tree of Life Congregation as a hate crime. At a press conference Sunday morning, officials said victims of a shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue range in age from 54 to 97. All but two of the victims were over the age of 65, and include one married couple, and two brothers. Six others were wounded, including four police officers. The Allegheny County Chief Medical Examiner released a list of congregants killed in the attack: Joyce Fienberg, 75, of Oakland, City of Pittsburgh Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill David Rosenthal, 54, of Squirrel Hill Cecil and David Rosenthal are brothers Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg Sylvan Simon, 86, of Wilkinsburg Bernice and Sylvan are husband and wife Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Irving Younger, 69, of Mt. Washington, City of Pittsburgh Federal prosecutors have charged Robert Bowers, 46, with 29 separate federal crimes for his attack on the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday morning. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said Bowers is charged with 11 counts of murdering victims who were exercising their religious beliefs, and 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. Brady said each of those 11 counts is punishable by death. "The final seven counts are based on the harm inflicted by Bowers, upon the brave police officers, who in trying to stop Bowers rampage, put their own lives in danger. Three of these brave men were shot by Bowers," Brady said at a press conference. At approximately 9:50 a.m., officials say Bowers entered the Tree of Life synagogue, armed with multiple weapons, including three Glock .357 handguns and an AR-15-style weapon. Bowers killed 11 individuals and wounded two others. Four police officers were injured in the attack, and "three of them were shot by Bowers," Brady said. During the shooting, "Bowers made statements regarding genocide, and his desire to kill Jewish people. After a standoff with police, Bowers eventually surrendered, and remains in federal custody today," Brady said. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called it the darkest day in the history of Pittsburgh. "Squirrel Hill is the most diverse neighborhood in all of western Pennsylvania," Peduto told reporters. "People choose to live there because of the diversity of the community. The Jewish community is the backbone. It is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh." "We will not try to rationalize irrational behavior," Peduto continued. "We will work to eradicate it. We will work to eradicate it from our city, from our nation, and our world. Hatred will not have a place anywhere. We will work locally to make those changes happen, and we will work with partners around this country, and around the world, to make sure that it ends." Officials say they are in the early stages of an investigation, and for now, they are treating the attack as a hate crime. Brady said, "A hate crime is where an individual is animated by a hatred or a certain animus towards a person of a certain ethnicity or religious faith, and it becomes domestic terrorism, where there is an ideology that that person is trying to propagate through violence. We continue to see where that line is." At this point, investigators say there is nothing to indicate Bowers had accomplices. Saturday's attack occurred days before the mid-term elections, and amid a surge in hate crimes in the United States. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979. Bowers is scheduled to make an appearance before a federal magistrate judge on Monday, Oct. 29. at 1:30 p.m. ET. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

Authorities say that while Bowers' motive remains unknown, "we believe he was acting alone." Eleven people were killed in the attack, and six were injured. "We're in the early stages of this investigation," Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, told reporters during an afternoon press conference. "Over the next several days and weeks, we will look at everything in the suspect's life: his home, his vehicle, his social media, and his movements over the last several days. At this point, we have no knowledge that Bowers was known to law enforcement before today." Bowers, 46, is a resident of Pittsburgh with a history of making anti-Semitic remarks on social media. Some of those remarks appeared under an account believed to belong to Bowers on Gab, an app that says it provides an alternative to anti-conservative bias on Facebook and Twitter. On the account, Bowers posted a link to the website of HIAS, a nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees. The link was for a Shabbat ceremony HIAS planned for refugees in locations across the country. The caption to Bowers' post read, "Why hello there HIAS! You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?" Hours before Saturday morning's shooting, the account posted again, "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, told NPR that he is in "a state of shock." "Refugees flee hate, and for this kind of vile act to happen in our country is devastating, and then on top of that to have it happen in a sanctuary, on the holiest day of the week, is unfathomable," Hetfield said. "There is simply too much space out there for hate, and it's hatred against refugees; hatred against Jews; hatred against Latinos; hatred against transgendered people; hatred against African-Americans; hatred against the other," Hetfield said. "It's just hate across the board, and there's too much space for it now. Everyone has to stand up to it now. We cannot tolerate this intolerance." Gab issued a statement on the synagogue shooting: Shortly after the attack, Gab was alerted to a user profile of the alleged Tree of Life Synagogue shooter. The account was verified and matched the name of the alleged shooter's name, which was mentioned on police scanners. This person also had accounts on other social networks. Gab took swift and proactive action to contact law enforcement immediately. We first backed up all user data from the account and then proceeded to suspend the account. We then contacted the FBI and made them aware of this account and the user data in our possession. We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served.

You're not responsible for the country on the day of a massive tragedy, so no, you're good. The President is responsible to the country on the day of a mass shooting, thus it is inappropriate for him to even comment on a culturally significant event taking place in the same country? Really cutting analysis, Josh. I don't believe for one damn second he tweeted this on his own. I agree. I’ll bet he truly believes he could replace Dave Roberts. I’m in shock...

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pro-trump-pundits-explosives-false-flag_us_5bd0d00fe4b0d38b587f66c6---split---It didn’t take long after apparent mail bombs were sent to two former U.S. presidents and a building full of journalists for the MAGA-worshipping sect of the internet to scream “false flag.” On Wednesday, authorities intercepted what appeared to be pipe bombs destined for the homes of former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with packages sent to the offices of other prominent Democrats, including Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) and Maxine Waters (Calif.). Meanwhile, people were forced to evacuate the Time Warner building in New York City as a bomb squad arrived to remove a package sent to CNN’s office that contained an unknown white powder. Fox News, the propaganda mouthpiece for President Donald Trump, had few qualms about suggesting this may have been a Democratic operation. Former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker told Fox News that the mailed makeshift bombs could have been the work of someone “trying to get the Democratic vote out,” Mediaite reported. “And as you correctly pointed out earlier, this doesn’t necessarily mean someone is espousing some sort of conservative ideology and targeting Democrats,” Swecker told Fox News co-host Melissa Francis. “It could be someone who is trying to get the Democratic vote out and incur sympathy.” “That’s an interesting point,” Francis responded. Online, right-wing conspiracy theorists frothed at the mouth at the idea that the mail bombs could be a “false flag” staged for political purposes. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh suggested that it must have been a Democrat who sent the bombs because, he baselessly argued, “Republicans just don’t do this sort of thing.” He added: “Even though every event, like mass shootings, remember, every mass shooting there is, the Democrats in the media try to make everybody think right off the bat that some tea partier did it, or some talk radio fan did it, or some Fox News viewer did it. Turns out, it’s never, ever the case.” Fox Business host and Trump confidant Lou Dobbs on Thursday said the bombs were “fake.” Fake News--Fake Bombs Who could possibly benefit by so much fakery?#MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs Michael Flynn Jr., the son of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, tweeted that the mailings were “a total false flag operation.” He later deleted the tweets and admitted he didn’t actually know if that was the case, but not before The Daily Beast picked them up. Folks, deleted a few tweets (not all) related to this ongoing craziness. I don’t know if it’s a false flag. However, I hate the timing as it provides a PERFECT narrative for @TheDemocrats going into the mid terms. Conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter called the timing of the attempted bombings “super convenient” for the left. Here's my bet... No one will be arrested for these alleged mail bombs. After dozens of college campus hoaxes by leftists, I don't buy this super convenient turn of events. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter called bombs a “liberal tactic.” From the Haymarket riot to the Unibomber, bombs are a liberal tactic. https://t.co/P3YvUorxwL John Cardillo, host of conservative media outlet Newsmax, said authorities should look at “far left groups” who “know they’re losing” while investigating the explosive devices, Mother Jones reported. Cardillo’s tweet was later deleted. And Infowars, the conspiracy outlet that has suggested the Sandy Hook shooting never happened, said the bombs could have been hoaxes planted by anti-fascists and that Republicans are “aware of false flag.” That echoes what they said Tuesday, when an explosive device was found at liberal billionaire George Soros’ home. Right-wing figure Jacob Wohl also chimed in with a baseless tweet, along with the popular alt-right website Gab. Many of the pundits spreading conspiracy theories about the explosives are verified on Twitter. These "Suspicious Package" stories are false flags, carefully planned for the midterms As an investigation continues, one thing is certain: Those crying “false flag” have absolutely zero evidence to back it up. This story has been updated with comments from Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbs. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims_us_5bd4bb77e4b0a8f17ef85213---split---Eight men and three women, ranging in age from 97 to 54, were killed at a crowded Pittsburgh synagogue after a gunman opened fire on the congregation during Saturday services, officials have announced. Allegheny County medical examiner Karl Williams named the victims at a news conference Sunday morning: Joyce Feinberg, 75 Richard Gottfried, 65 Rose Mallinger, 97 Jerry Rabinowitz, 66 Brothers Cecil, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54 Husband and wife Sylvan, 86, and Bernice Simon, 84 Daniel Stein, 71 Melvin Wax, 88 Irving Youngner, 69 Williams said that the victims’ families had been notified and are “in shock and grieving.” Their bodies are undergoing autopsies, and authorities are “doing everything in our power that honors both civil and religious law,” he said. It could take up to a week to finish processing the crime scene, given that bodies were found in three different locations, Williams said. “There are shell casings everywhere,” he said. Feinberg, a mother of two sons, leaves behind several grandchildren, reported The Associated Press. Before she retired in 2008, she was a longtime researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center. “Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being,” Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, Feinberg’s former research partner, told the AP. Rabinowitz was a doctor, cat lover and “the kindest person you could dream of meeting,” his friend, Anna Boswell-Levy, said in a Facebook post. “He was such a good and caring man,” added Lisa Wesson-Richardson, one of his employees. “This is such huge loss to his family, his staff and his patients!” Stein, a retired plumbing salesman as well as a husband, father of two and grandfather of one, attended Shabbat services every Saturday morning, his nephew, Steven Halle, told WPXI News on Saturday. “Everybody loved him, there wasn’t one person that didn’t like him in the community,” Halle said. Wax, a retired accountant, was “such a kind, kind person,” Myron Snider, chairman of the congregation’s cemetery committee, told the AP. “When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them,” Snider said. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die,” before carrying out the attack, according to police sources. Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges against him on Saturday evening, 22 of which could result in him being sentenced to death. Bowers brought three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle into the synagogue, all of which he used in the massacre, Williams said. He’s expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. A Torah study and Shabbat services were scheduled at the synagogue on Saturday. During the shooting, a bris ― a Jewish circumcision ceremony for an infant boy ― was reportedly taking place at the Tree of Life synagogue. Six people, including four police officers, were injured. One officer has been released from hospitalization and officials said a second one is expected to be released sometime on Sunday. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” Hayley Miller contributed reporting. This story has been updated with details on some of the victims.

(Photo By Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday there is nothing she would trade for President Donald Trump’s border wall, setting a hard negotiating stance in advance of an expected December showdown over the issue. “It happens to be like a manhood issue for the president, building a wall, and I’m not interested in that,” the California Democrat said during a discussion at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats would act quickly on gun violence prevention, protections for Dreamers and infrastructure if they retake the House. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) If Democrats control the House in 2019 they would quickly schedule floor action on gun violence prevention, protections for “Dreamers” and infrastructure, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday. “When we win and we take over in January, some of the issues that will come up soon are the issues we are asking the speaker to take up now,” Pelosi said, naming those three issues. A demonstrator is seen on the Mall near the student-led March for Our Lives rally to call for action to prevent gun violence. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) More than 100 town hall meetings across the country this week are focusing on gun violence — including two in New York’s traditionally gun-friendly 19th District. Two Democratic candidates hoping to take on GOP Rep. John Faso are hosting town hall meetings as activists look to sustain focus on gun control issues following the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speak to reporters following a meeting of House and Senate leaders in Speaker Ryan’s office on the $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 omnibus appropriations bill on Wednesday, March 21, 2018. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Congressional leaders emerged just before 11 a.m. Wednesday from a meeting to negotiate outstanding issues on a fiscal 2018 omnibus spending bill predicting a deal was forthcoming in a matter of hours. “We feel like we’re in a good place,” the Wisconsin Republican said upon exiting his office, where the meeting was held. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said much work remains to iron out issues on an omnibus spending bill that House GOP leaders hope to bring to the floor next week. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The nearly six-month delayed fiscal 2018 omnibus spending bill could be brought to the House floor next week, but appropriators are still encountering major obstacles in drafting a bipartisan bill — even with unrelated landmines cleared. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said he would like to bring the omnibus to the floor next week, but during a week-end colloquy with House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, he did not announce it as a definite part of the upcoming floor schedule. Rather, he noted action on the spending package was “possible.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Speaker Paul D.

(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) House Republican leaders on Tuesday announced their legislative response to a mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead — a bill to create a federal grant program for schools to implement threat assessment protocols. But Democrats are already calling the measure insufficient. The House will vote next week on a bill by Florida GOP Rep. John Rutherford, called the STOP School Violence Act, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. A man has been cited for violating two laws during the state's first regulated elk hunt. (Istock) A Wisconsin man has been cited for violating a state statute after he shot an elk across a roadway during the state’s inaugural elk hunt. Joe Wiltzius, 73, of Franklin, was charged with illegally shooting the first bull elk of the season by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Journal Sentinel reports. AMERICAN EAGLE FLIGHT STRIKES, KILLS DEER DURING TAKEOFF AT PENNSYLVANIA AIRPORT The man was reportedly hunting with a guide and a friend on Oct. 15 when, around 3:30 pm, he fired across the street from 100 yards away. According to the Sentinel, the men dragged the elk into the woods to gut it and phoned a DNR biologist to verify the kill and take samples. Dave Zebro, DNR warden supervisor, told the Sentinel the men were interviewed and an investigation was opened into the hunt, which revealed Wiltzius had broken laws, including shooting across a roadway and hunting within 50 feet of the center line of a roadway. He may also face a $2,000 wild animal surcharge for the kill. SOUTH CAROLINA FAMILY ASKS HUNTERS NOT TO KILL PET DEER The hide and antlers of the elk were seized by the DNR. The venison will be held until the case is decided, and then will likely be donated to a food pantry, the Sentinel reports. The friend and guide have not been charged, but the guide may lose his license. Wiltzius was one of five non-tribal hunters in the state to receive tags through the DNR lottery for the first-ever regulated elk season. Five other tags were reserved for members of Wisconsin’s Native American tribes. HUNTER AND HOST OF 'LARYSA UNLEASHED' SLAMMED FOR POSING WITH DEAD GOAT IN SCOTLAND The state decided to open the hunt this year because the population of elk exceeded 200 — the state requirement for a limited bull hunt. The DNR received around 38,000 applications and $13,000 in donations for the hunt, the Sentinel reports. “Many partners and individuals contributed to this great conservation story in Wisconsin, which allowed us to hold this first hunt,” Schaller said to the Sentinel. “The state is dedicated to ensuring hunting laws are honored to make sure it is a fair and safe hunt, and this case is a reflection of that.” FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS The state’s elk season will through Nov. 11., and then from Dec. 13 to Dec. 21.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/27/18032314/trump-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-tree-of-life---split---President Donald Trump reacted to a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday by suggesting the congregation should have had better security and saying it was time to “bring the death penalty into vogue.” The “results” of the incident were “more devastating than anybody thought,” Trump told reporters early Saturday afternoon before leaving for a speech in Indianapolis. A shooter opened fire at Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday, killing multiple people and injuring others, including shooting three police officers. “It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world,” he said. “And something has to be done.” As to what that “something” is, it remains unclear. When asked by a reporter whether lawmakers should revisit gun laws, Trump seemed to suggest that the people inside of the synagogue should have protected themselves. “If they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation,” he said. He complimented police officers on their outstanding work and lamented that there’s “violence all over the world.” Trump said that he believes the US should “stiffen up laws in terms of the death penalty” — the shooter is currently in police custody — and said shooters should pay “the ultimate price.” He distanced himself when asked about his ties to the NRA, again seeming to blame the synagogue, suggesting that “if there were an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop” the shooter. He said he’s “always talking” with the NRA and said such situations are especially difficult for him because he’s president. “It’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this kind of a thing happen,” he said. This is the second incident of violence Trump has had to deal with this week: Florida man Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr. was arrested and charged on Friday with sending bombs to 13 prominent Democrats and critics of the president. “This is a world with a lot of problems,” Trump said. “And it has been a world with a lot of problems for many years.” Here’s a rush transcript of Trump’s remarks: Trump: We’ll be making a major statement. It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country frankly and all over the world. And something has to be done. Something has to be done. It looks like results are coming in, they’re more devastating than anybody thought in the morning. In the morning they thought it was the shooter but they had the shooter, they soon would, but the results are very devastating. You’re seeing the numbers come in. So we’ll be speaking to you at the conference, the future farmers of America, conference, and it’s just a shame to watch this, to see this. For so many years, so much of it, absolutely a shame. Have any questions? Question: Mr. President do you think you need to revisit gun laws? Trump: Please? Question: Gun laws, Mr. President. Gun laws. Trump: Well, again, this has little to do with it if you take a look. If they had protection inside the results would have been far better. This is a dispute that will always exist I suspect. If they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation. They didn’t. And he was able to do things that unfortunately he shouldn’t have been able to do. I hear the police were outstanding. I hear the police did an incredible job. As you know, numerous police were badly injured. But, again, law enforcement did a fantastic job. We’re going to have a very complete statement for you. Results are coming in of what took place, how it took place. Again, law enforcement was outstanding. As always. I mean, as usual, and as always, law enforcement was really outstanding. They stepped up to the plate. But Pittsburgh, great community, incredible people. I spoke to the governor. I spoke to the mayor. To see this happening again and again and again is just a shame. Question: Mr. President -- [inaudible] Instead of seeing it happen again and again, end this kind of violence? Trump: Well, it’s a violence -- you look at the violence all over the world. I mean, the world has violence. The world is a violent world. And you think when you’re over it, it just sort of goes away, but then it comes back in the form of a mad man, a whacko. I think one thing we should do is stiffen up laws in terms of the death penalty. When people do this, they should get the death penalty and shouldn’t have to wait years and years. Now the laws lawyers will get involved and everybody’s going to get involved and we’ll be ten years down the line. I think they should stiffen up laws and I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue. Anybody who does a thing like this to innocent people in temple, in church. We had so many incidents with churches. They should be -- they should really suffer the ultimate price. They should pay the ultimate price. I felt that way for a long time. Some people disagree with me. I can’t imagine why. This has to stop. We’re going to have a statement at our stop with the young farmers. Question: Towards the beginning of your presidency, you met with the NRA. You said maybe you were the president who can help solve this. Do you see that now as a possibility? Trump: It’s a case where -- again, nobody knows exactly what took place yet. It’s too soon. This is a case where they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately. This had been a case where if there were an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop them. Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him frankly. So it’s a very, very -- very difficult situation. When you look at it, we can look at it two ways. Again, if he had somebody to protect people. Now, isn’t it a shame you even have to speak that way? That we even have to think of that inside a temple or inside of a church? But certainly the results might have been far better. Question: Do you think all churches and synagogues should have armed guards? Trump: I hate to think of it that way. I will say that. So we’ll see you with the future farmers. Question: Is that what you’re suggesting? Trump: I mean, in this world, this is a world with a lot of problems. And it has been a world with a lot of problems for many years. Many, many years. You could say, frankly, for many centuries. You’re looking at what goes on, but certainly you want protection. They didn’t have any protection. They had a maniac walk in. They didn’t have any protection. That is just so sad to see. So sad to see. Results could have been much better. It is a very, very difficult thing. For me, as president, to watch any of this go, you know, before I ran for office, I’d watch incidents like this with churches and other things and think, what a shame, what a shame. But it’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this kind of a thing happen. It is so sad to see. So we’ll see you at the -- with the young farmers.

Garcetti said that the LAPD would step up patrols and has reached out to community leaders to address any concerns in the wake of the incident. He said the Pittsburgh incident has no specific connection to anything in Los Angeles. The LAPD issued its own statement on the matter: “We are monitoring the situation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania very closely and communicating with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners. Right now, there is no apparent connection to Los Angeles. However, out of an abundance of caution you will see extra patrols around houses of worship today. Remember if you see something…say something.” No nexus to LA if the shooting in Pittsburgh.

Michael Drejka, 48, was arrested Monday after the state attorney’s office for Pinellas and Pasco counties filed the criminal charge against him for killing Markeis McGlockton in a convenience store parking lot in Clearwater. Police had originally decided not to arrest Drejka, citing Florida’s stand-your-ground law, which allows gun owners to use deadly force if they feel they are facing “imminent death or great bodily harm.” The case was then referred to state prosecutors to decide whether charges would be brought. JUST IN: Michael Drejka’s booking photo. pic.twitter.com/hy8svKIMIE “This is exactly what I wanted,“ McGlockton’s father Michael told reporters on Monday. “This is exactly what me and my family wanted was to get this guy behind bars.” Surveillance video captured Drejka firing his weapon at McGlockton outside the convenience store on July 19. The dispute began after McGlockton left his car idling in a handicap space while he ran into the store to purchase snacks, his girlfriend Britany Jacobs told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Jacobs was waiting in the car with their two children when Drejka approached and began “harassing” her for parking in a handicap spot without a permit, she said. McGlockton came over and shoved Drejka to the ground, according to Jacobs. That’s when Drejka, still on the ground, shot McGlockton in the chest, she said. McGlockton was pronounced dead at a hospital 30 minutes later. “He wanted somebody to be angry at,” Jacobs said of Drejka. “He just wanted someone to fight him. He was picking a fight. ABC reported that the owner of the convenience store, who was not named, has previously called the police to report Drejka for confronting customers over parking spaces. The stand-your-ground law, which Florida adopted in 2005, drew intense scrutiny after the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Though Zimmerman did not invoke the statute in his defense, the judge instructed the jury on the law, and it was cited by a juror after the trial as a factor in the jury’s deliberations.

Newsom highlighted the tour in a fundraising email sent out Tuesday morning, which is part of his “Blue California” campaign to help Democrats in both congressional and legislative races. In a recent Pod Save America podcast, Newsom said he’s not taking his lead in the governor’s race for granted, but plans to spend “a lot of time and energy” helping down-ballot candidates. An independent political committee backing Republican John Cox for California governor released a new campaign ad bashing Democratic candidate Gavin Newsom as a “child of privilege” with a far-left political agenda. The independent expenditure committee, Restore Our Values, paid $250,000 to air the aid on Fox News, CNN and other outlets for the next week, said Jennifer Jacobs, spokesperson for the organization. The one-minute ad attempts to contrast Cox and Newsom, casting Cox as a self-made man and Newsom as product of the well-connected, well-heeled San Francisco political class. A bipartisan group of California lawmakers proposed on Tuesday to spend $1 billion to clear fire-prone trees and brush from across the state over the next five years while providing new relief for utility companies that have said wildfire costs could lead them to bankruptcy. But critics maintained provisions in the bill offer little protection to utility customers from footing the bill, even when the companies are found at fault for some amount of a fire’s origins. “Make no mistake about it, it's not perfect,” said state Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa), a co-chair of the committee. “Little that we do here ever is.” In response to a mass shooting six months ago at a Florida high school, California lawmakers on Tuesday sent the governor a bill that would allow teachers, employers and co-workers to ask judges to remove guns from people they see as a danger to the public. The state Senate voted to expand the state’s gun-violence restraining order law, which currently allows family members and law enforcement to petition the court to temporarily remove guns from persons seen as a threat to the public. Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) said he introduced the bill in response to the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in which a 19-year-old former student allegedly killed 17 people. ➡️@JerryBrownGov Signs Legislation to Revamp California's Bail System, Protect Public Safety: https://t.co/MkgYsL3Nml #SB10 pic.twitter.com/eDJfKPd4Kv California Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday signed a landmark bill to overhaul the state’s money-bail system, replacing it with one that grants judges greater power to decide who should remain incarcerated ahead of trial. The two-year effort fulfills a pledge made by Brown last year when he stalled negotiations over the ambitious legislation, saying he would continue to work with lawmakers and the state’s top Supreme Court justice on the right approach to change the system. The new law puts California at the forefront of a national push to stop courts from imposing a heavy financial burden on defendants before they have faced a jury. “Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,” he said in a statement. California lawmakers crafting state wildfire prevention policy clashed late Monday night over key details in a lengthy proposal, deep disagreements that threaten to stymie action in the Legislature for 2018. Much of the discussion during the joint conference committee hearing focused on what has consistently been the sticking point for both lawmakers and stakeholders: how much to ease the financial impact to the state’s electric utilities for fires involving their equipment. Some continued to suggest that investor-owned utility companies could be at risk of bankruptcy if no action is taken. “The conversation up here has to be focused on making sure that event doesn’t happen,” said state Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa), a co-chairman of the committee. Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday vetoed a bill that would have prevented politicians from paying family members an amount greater than fair-market value for goods and services. The bill by Assemblyman Marc Steinorth (R-Rancho Cucamonga) sought to ban politicians from making excessive payments to parents, children and siblings working on their campaigns. "This proposed new authority for the Fair Political Practices Commission concerns me," Brown wrote in his veto message. A controversial proposal to allow state legislative leaders to accept bigger campaign checks for their favored candidates was sidelined by lawmakers for the year on Monday after it failed to garner sufficient support in the state Senate. The measure by Assemblyman Kevin Mullin (D-South San Francisco) would have allowed Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate and Assembly to form caucus committees to accept campaign contributions of up to $36,000 from individual sources for state races. Legislators are now limited to accepting contributions of no more than $4,400 from each source. Mullin’s bill would have also required monthly disclosure of campaign contributions. San Francisco would be able to establish hygienic sites for people to use injectable drugs while supervised by healthcare workers under a bill approved Monday by the Legislature. The measure, Assembly Bill 186 by Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman (D-Stockton), would let San Francisco pilot a “safe injection site” program, which would include access to sterilized needles and referrals to drug treatment programs. Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said San Francisco Mayor London Breed has offered to make the city a “guinea pig” for the program. California lawmakers on Monday approved a trio of bills that would reduce the number of people with access to firearms, including lifetime bans on owning guns for people convicted of domestic violence and individuals placed on involuntary psychiatric holds twice in a year by the courts. The three bills now head to the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown for consideration. Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) proposed a lifetime gun ban on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, which extends the current 10-year prohibition in state law.

WASHINGTON—The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting on Saturday and the arrest days earlier in the case of pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats are forcing Republicans and Democrats to adapt on the fly in the final full week of campaigning before midterm elections.

Mr. Doyle in an interview indicated that he and others would be looking to take action to prevent similar future events. “These next c... American farmers hit by the U.S.-China trade battle are preparing to reshape the U.S. Farm Belt by planting more corn and less soybeans next year over a land mass potentially equal to the size of Connecticut. For decades, corn was U.S. farmers’ crop of choice, its tall stalks carpeting the Midwestern landscape. Soybeans, shorter and bushier, began decades ago as a niche crop raised on less acreage but came to rival corn in recent years because of growing demand from China. U.S. farmers in 2018 planted more soybeans than corn for the first time in more than three decades, betting on that dem...

It has been two hundred years since the anonymous publication of a novel that would capture the world’s imagination: “Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.” As would later be revealed, the gothic masterpiece was written by the English author Mary Shelley when she was still a teenager.

It would be easy to think of “Suspiria” as a departure for Luca Guadagnino. Critics swooned over the Italian director’s 2017 film, “Call Me By Your Name,” calling it “a lovely cinematic feather” and “a wonderfully sensitive and evocative portrait of young love.” The story of a 17-year-old boy who falls for his father’s 24-year-old male student at an Italian villa got a Best Picture nomination. James Ivory (“A Room With a View”) won an Oscar for the screenplay. “Suspiria,” Mr. Guadagnino’s film opening nation-wide Nov. 2, is a reboot of a gory 1977 horror movie with a memorable scene of magg...

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-pains-reconcile-campaign-message-violent-events-000938771.html---split---If Donald Trump’s political rise was made possible by his angry and defiant inflections while campaigning in the 2016 presidential election, that same bombastic tone has proved more difficult to sustain in a week marred by politically motivated violence and death. As much of the nation recoiled Saturday from the news that suspect Robert Bowers had opened fire in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing at least 11 people and leaving six more wounded, the president faced a decision — for the second time this week — as to whether to cancel a planned political rally. “We can’t let evil change our life and change our schedule. We can’t do that. We have to go,” Trump said of his rally at Southern Illinois Airport in Murphysboro, Ill., and his attendance at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis. “It doesn’t mean that we can’t fight hard and be strong and say what’s on our mind, but we have to always remember those elements: We have to remember the elements of love and dignity and respect, and so many others.” The balance that Trump must now achieve in the final nine days before the midterms, whose outcome could stall his agenda, is how hard to hit his political opponents and the news media that reports on his administration. That uncomfortable dynamic was on display during the president’s rally in North Carolina on Friday night, just hours after Cesar Sayoc, an apparent Trump superfan, was arrested for allegedly sending pipe bombs to critics of the president. “In recent days we have had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our national dialogue. Everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction. We must unify as a nation in peace, love and in harmony. The media has a major role to play, whether they want to or not,” Trump said Friday as his crowd broke out into boos, then a chant of “CNN sucks!” Trump responded to that by adding, “And they do indeed, they have a major role to play as far as tone and as far as everything.” When compared with Trump’s muted speech on Thursday, the day it was learned that pipe bombs had been mailed to leading Democratic figures among others, Friday’s speech drifted back to Trump’s unapologetic, incendiary rhetoric that has defined his rallies. A similar pattern held on Saturday, with the president beginning with a somber tone before pivoting to take on his political rivals once more. “Well, I want to thank everybody, because this was a rough, rough day for us,” Trump began at his Illinois rally aiming to boost Republican Rep. Mike Bost. “Before going any further, I want to address the horrible shooting that took place earlier today,” Trump continued. “The hearts of all Americans are filled with grief following the monstrous killing of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa.” Trump, whose daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism after marrying Jared Kushner, went on to decry the “evil anti-Semitic attack,” saying “it will require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-Semitism from our world.” Bowers has a trail of anti-Semitic posts on social media. “We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate, that’s what it is,” Trump said before pivoting to make a plea to reinstate death penalty laws nationwide. “We have to bring back the death penalty. They have to pay the ultimate price,” Trump said, adding, “We must draw a line in the sand and say, ‘Never again.’” Absent from Trump’s Illinois speech was any mention of “globalists,” but the president did make use of the term hours earlier in Indiana. “We don’t worry too much about the globalists. … We have to take care of ourselves before we start worrying about others,” Trump said Saturday. In several speeches this week, in fact, Trump reprised his “globalism” refrain and promoted himself as a “nationalist.” While the president’s stated reasoning is that global trade agreements have hurt American workers, in the parlance of anti-Semites, the term “globalist” is used as a stand-in for “Jewish.” “It’s an epithet that is disproportionately directed at a particular minority group. Just as ‘thug’ is often used to invoke the stereotype that African-Americans are violent, ‘globalist’ can play on the stereotype that Jews are disloyal,” Peter Beinart wrote earlier this year in the Atlantic. Yet that association has not stopped Trump from adopting the term into his vocabulary. At a raucous White House event on Friday, Trump attacked “globalists” who he said are “cheating” America. A member of his audience shouted “Soros!” which led another to shout “Lock him up!” The president, meanwhile, chuckled in response. Soros was the first person to be targeted in this week’s pipe bomb attacks. After explaining his decision to go forward with his Saturday rally in Illinois despite the shooting in Pittsburgh, Trump told his crowd that he was “going to tone it down just a little, OK?” But many in the audience, apparently still hungry for Trump’s hard-hitting rhetoric, shouted “No!” While Trump’s stump speech may have taken a little longer to find its political legs, the president eventually returned to deriding Hillary Clinton to chants of “Lock her up!” As he had the day before, Trump blasted Democrats for their “resist and obstruct” agenda, and warned about a return of “Speaker Nancy Pelosi” and the power that would await Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., another target of the pipe bomb attacks, if Republicans suffer significant losses in November. The president also referenced the Central American migrant caravan making its way toward the U.S. border with Mexico. “Caravan, turn around. You’re not coming in. You’re not coming in. I’m sorry,” Trump said, before moving on to once again mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as “Pocahontas.” While those lines of attack would, in and of themselves, make for a crowd-pleasing stump speech, the question now for Trump and the Republicans, after a week of horrific headlines of crimes committed by individuals who appear influenced by philosophies either inspired by or to the right of the president, is whether the message of his campaign blitz will still resonate with voters or seem diminished by current events. “This election is about borders and this election is about jobs,” Trump assured his audience in Illinois, the somber tone that had started the rally but a footnote. _____ Read more from Yahoo News:
---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/gab-social-media-used-pittsburgh-060000248.html---split---The mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue has drawn scrutiny on the Gab social media site after the suspect was found to have used it to express anti-Semitic views. The website, Gab.com, said it suspended his account and contacted the authorities after the arrest but it was not enough to stop internet services from cutting ties with it. The website, which is popular with white nationalists and members of the so-called alt-right, said on Saturday night it was being forced offline following the attack that left 11 people dead. It said its hosting provider Joyent would be suspending its services as of Monday morning, while PayPal has also reportedly banned the site. "Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this," the site said on its Twitter account. "We will continue to fight for free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Big tech can not stop us. The mainstream media can not stop us. The People will defend freedom against tyranny as they always have and always will," it tweeted. The website went offline temporarily on Saturday night, after which it tweeted: "We spent the past hour backing up everything in light of our hosting provider pulling service on Monday." Shortly before bursting into the Tree of Life Congregation yeling "all Jews must die", the suspect Robert Bowers posted his final message on Gab. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he said. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital after being shot several times by police, was charged late on Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offences. The 46-year-old appeared to be the author of a recent rash of violently anti-Semitic posts on the controversial social networking website, where conspiracy theories are common. Gab had earlier released a statement saying it had "zero tolerance" for violence or terrorism and was "saddened and disgusted by the news" from Pittsburgh. It said in a post that after learning of the attack, it had matched the name of the alleged shooter to one of its account holders. It then took down the Bowers account and immediately contacted the FBI, adding: "We will do everything in our power to work with law enforcement to see that justice is served." Gab launched in 2016 as a "free-speech" alternative to Twitter. Its founder, Andrew Torba, said existing sites like Twitter and Facebook have a left-leaning monopoly on social media. It allows users to read and write unfiltered messages of up to 300 characters, called "gabs". The home page describes the platform as "a social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online. All are welcome." Gab is a popular gathering place for alt-right activists and white nationalists whose views are unwelcome or banned on other social media platforms. Early members included the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website. Other well known users have included controversial media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. Apple blocked the app from its App store in 2016, citing pornographic content, and later, hate speech. Google blocked the app from its Google Play store for hate speech, which brought a law suit from Gab that was eventually dropped. An investigation by The Telegraph in August found dozens of pages of racist and anti-Semitic material on the website, which was being hosted by Microsoft at the time. “Microsoft terminated its Azure agreement with Gab last month. The Gab.com and Gab.ai websites are no longer hosted on Azure,” a Microsoft spokesperson told the Telegraph after the shooting. One post, in Gab’s “Brexit” group, displays a rifle with the caption “wh--- and ni---- repellent". Another, which was posted repeatedly over the course of several days, claims that Jewish people were responsible for “all labour and sex slavery” and is illustrated by a cartoon of an old man with a large nose. When approached by the Telegraph at the time, a Gab spokesman said: “We don’t do interviews with fake news outlets that employ sophist political activists pretending to be journalists. Figure it out for yourself.” Moments later the official Gab account posted a picture of a Gladiator’s arena on Twitter, writing: “Back in the day they would have just thrown dishonest journalists in here with the gladiators. "They would have lasted all of four seconds.”

The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was taken into custody after surrendering to police. He was transported to a local hospital with unspecified injuries. FBI Special Agent Bob Jones said that Bowers was armed with an “AR-15 style” rifle in addition to three handguns. Bowers was not known to law enforcement before Saturday, Jones added. According to KDKA, Pittsburgh’s CBS affiliate, Bowers walked into the building and yelled “All Jews must die” before opening fire. Federal officials are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. Bowers was an active user of Gab, a Twitter alternative that promotes itself as supporting free speech. An account appearing to belong to Bowers — now deactivated — was littered with anti-Semitic messages. His bio on the site read “jews are the children of satan.” The most recent post, published shortly before the shooting, criticized the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) for its resettlement of refugees. “HIAS likes to bring in invaders that kill our people,” he wrote. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughters.” The post concluded with a chilling message: “Screw your optics, I’m going in.” In a post from two days ago, Bowers wrote that President Trump is “a globalist, not a nationalist.” It also referred to the so-called “QAnon” conspiracy. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he added. In another online post, Bowers showed off his collection of handguns, calling them “my glock family.” In a statement, Gab administrators said they suspended Bowers’s profile once they’d been alerted to a verified account matching the name of the suspected shooter. “We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served,” they wrote, and also declared, “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” Neighbors of the alleged gunman expressed disbelief. Danielle Manko, 32, who lives across the street from the alleged shooter’s most recent address, told Yahoo News that “he’s usually never there.” “I haven’t seen him in probably like three weeks,” she said, adding, “They always kept to themselves.” Another resident who lives near Bowers’s apartment complex, 63-year-old Terrence Holleran, said it was “as much of a surprise to us as it was to anyone else” that an alleged shooter lived there. “This is not an area that has a lot of problems,” Holleran said. “It’s just unfortunate that this asshole decided to live here.” With Yahoo News’ correspondent Matt Stroud reporting from Pittsburgh _____ Read more from Yahoo News:
---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-sarah-scott-kip-pardue-20181028-story.html---split---Sarah Scott was lying under the covers wearing only nipple covers and boy shorts when, she says, her co-star Kip Pardue became aroused. She could tell because he took her hand and placed it on his groin just as they were about to film a post-coital scene for an independent television pilot, “Mogulettes.”  She was shocked by his behavior, particularly because it happened on May 16, mere months after hundreds of allegations of sexual misconduct had been made against powerful men in Hollywood.  Still, Scott shot the scene. When filming was done, she says Pardue called her into his dressing room, where he proceeded to masturbate in front of her.  “I literally froze,” Scott, 35, recalls. “I said, ‘What are you doing?’”  “This isn’t a #MeToo thing,” she alleges he responded. “I’m not your employer. It’s not like I can fire you.”  Scott says she ran out of the room. She had been a working actress for more than 14 years, appearing on episodes of popular television shows such as “True Blood” and “Castle,” but had never experienced a co-star doing something like this. Pardue, who is a series regular on Marvel’s Hulu series “The Runaways,” has appeared in films such as “Remember the Titans” and “The Rules of Attraction” over his two-decade career. The pilot they were filming did not yet have a network or streaming partner attached, but producers hoped to attract interest after it was completed.  As Scott encountered Pardue while preparing to leave the set of “Mogulettes,” she says she asked him why he had masturbated in front of her. She says he told her it was because she was “just so hot.”  When contacted by The Times, Pardue apologized for placing Scott’s hand on his penis during their scene together. But he denied everything the actress alleges that happened after the scene was completed.  "I clearly misread the situation during a sex scene on set and have apologized to Sarah,” Pardue, 43, said in a statement provided by his representative, David Shane. “I never intended to offend her in any way and deeply regret my actions and have learned from my behavior."  When Scott returned home from the set that day, she told her husband what had happened. It was the first of many times she would share her story.  From reaching out to the show’s producers, the Screen Actors Guild and the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund to filing a police report with the Hermosa Beach Police Department, Scott did everything she thought she was supposed to do — following all of the protocols that had been touted by the entertainment industry in the wake of last fall’s reckoning.  “How can I be part of the solution? How can I do right by my community?” she recalls thinking at the time. “What can I do that’s actually going to make a dent in preventing this guy from doing this again?”  But for five months, she was frustrated by what she saw as slow movement and conflicting advice from industry and production leaders. After nearly a year of industry hand-wringing and fundraising, of hotline and subcommittee creation, of vows by guilds and studios, she says she feels Hollywood remains a business with many temporary workplaces overseen by a wide variety of people with varying degrees of authority.  After sharing the story with her husband, Scott says the next people she reported the incident to were “Mogulettes” director Dave Fraunces and producer Mandy Henderson.  “Sarah asked to speak with [us] the moment she got on set,” Fraunces says. “I did not suspect anything like that had occurred until Sarah mentioned it to me. I was shocked.”  Pardue had completed his work on the set and the project’s executive producer, Bennett Talsky, says he reported the claims to a SAG-AFTRA business representative. Talsky, whose background is in construction consulting, was segueing into entertainment for the first time with "Mogulettes” and says he felt unsure of the protocol to follow. He called both actors to get their version of events, but Pardue “danced around the whole thing and never admitted to it,” Talsky says.  “He was trying to justify it, saying they had really good chemistry and he got carried away,” Talsky adds. “It didn’t get anywhere, and I didn’t really confront him — I was just trying to feel him out and see if he felt like he had screwed up.” What can I do that’s actually going to make a dent in preventing this guy from doing this again?  On May 21, Scott decided to personally follow up with SAG-AFTRA. She searched the union’s website and determined she should get in touch with the union’s Equal Employment Opportunities and Diversity Department. The man who answered the phone said he was new to the department but requested that Scott recount the entire on-set incident with Pardue, which she did. She was told that she would soon be contacted by Donna Reed, the department coordinator.  The following day, she connected with Reed, who presented her with a number of resources via email.  “While this is not intended to pass judgment on anyone involved, I am terribly sorry for what you experienced,” said Reed’s May 22 email, which Scott provided to The Times. “If anyone who believes they were subjected to unlawful harassment, the fact that they do not remain silent empowers us all to shine a light in the dark and take action against this behavior so that it is less likely to be repeated.”  Reed listed a number of options for Scott. She could make a member-to-member union complaint, which would be handled by SAG-AFTRA’s legal department. She could file a police report with the L.A. Police Department. She could contact a lawyer via the union’s free legal hotline or the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. She could seek therapeutic counseling through the Actors Fund or the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN.  Scott felt overwhelmed. She didn’t feel that she needed to call the crisis center. She was unsure if going to the police would make a difference. And she didn’t want to sue Pardue for any financial gain. She just wanted to help make the industry safer for women.  She thought her best move might be to file a member-to-member complaint with SAG-AFTRA. Per Reed’s suggestion, Scott reached out to the organization’s legal department and was connected with Delia Aparicio, senior counsel at SAG-AFTRA. Again, she was asked to recount the incident.  “I feel like her intentions were good, but it was clear that she was very inexperienced with this particular kind of process,” Scott recalls. “If I had a question about confidentiality — ‘Can I talk to the media? Can I talk to agents and managers about this?’ — she kept saying, ‘I’m going to have to check on that.’”  Scott also says she was told by Aparicio, who declined multiple requests to comment for this story, that if she pursued the member-to-member route, “you’re probably not gonna be satisfied.”  “The feeling I got was, ‘It’s really not worth your time,’” says Scott, who was told the process typically takes six to nine months. “And yet that was the only thing you could do through SAG.”  Although Aparicio did not speak with The Times about Scott’s description of their communication, Pamela Greenwalt, SAG-AFTRA’s chief communications and marketing officer, provided an overview of the member-to-member reporting process, referring to an article in the union’s constitution about “Discipline of Members.”  “Legal and disciplinary matters are strictly confidential and thus, as is customary, SAG-AFTRA declined to comment on your specific inquiry,” Greenwalt said on behalf of the guild.  After her conversation with Aparicio, Scott says she sought advice from a few trusted individuals. One of them was Kevin Kane, an actor and comedian who frequently collaborates with Amy Schumer. Because of Schumer’s involvement with Time’s Up, he thought the actress could help. With Scott’s permission, he told Schumer on May 24 about the situation and Schumer texted Kane with direct contact information for Time’s Up and SAG-AFTRA representatives.  The Emmy-winning comedian says she feels the union has a “long way to go” to ensure safety on set, in auditions and rehearsals. "Most actresses I know have experienced violations on set of a sexual nature, including myself,” Schumer told The Times. “You can be shooting a scene — or even auditioning a scene and your scene partner can take it too far. And if you speak up about it, you're made to feel difficult." Scott had filmed intimate moments in projects before “Mogulettes,” and says it’s rare for any production member to discuss the details of such a scene before shooting it. That was the case on “Mogulettes,” where she says she and Pardue never had a conversation about how to approach their scripted kissing scene. "It was just kind of, like, 'Go!'" she says. "It was pretty awkward." Last week, HBO announced that the network will hire "intimacy coordinators" to monitor any sexually intimate scenes filmed on the sets of its programs. Scott says that such an individual might have prevented the alleged misconduct that happened during "Mogulettes." "Walking through the intimacy of a scene could be super preventative," the actress says. "We have weapon masters. We have stunt choreographers. A designated position for this kind of work is encouraging to me." Sympathetic to Scott’s plight, Schumer, connected her with Rebecca Rottenberg Goldman, the chief operating officer of Time’s Up. Goldman sent Scott to Katherine Atkinson, a lawyer who had volunteered her services to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has received more than $20 million from Time’s Up to help women who could not afford legal counsel.  On May 25, when Scott told Atkinson that she did not want to file a civil suit, the lawyer advised her to speak with Kendra Barkoff, a public relations consultant with SKDKnickerbocker who represents Time’s Up.  Scott agreed to speak with Barkoff, again recounting her on-set allegations. Barkoff said that if Scott was interested in telling her story to a reporter, she could help connect her with different media outlets. Eventually, Barkoff referred Scott to The Times.  Meanwhile, Scott continued to discuss her legal options with Atkinson, but on their third phone call, the lawyer told Scott that she would need to pay Atkinson $2,500 to retain her services.  Scott had assumed Atkinson was working pro bono, but some lawyers working through the Legal Defense Fund ask to be paid. According to Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, not all of the attorneys affiliated with the organization charge a $2,500 retainer. “Some work pro bono, some work for less, and we’ve had cases where they applied for funding to cover the retainer for the client — ‘We’ll take this case if we get funding, and if we don’t, we won’t,’” she said.  Atkinson later said Scott could file for financial aid through the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, but told her “it wasn’t 100% certain they would reimburse” her.  Unwilling to take the financial risk, Scott set aside the idea of retaining an attorney and returned to SAG-AFTRA. Schumer had connected her with actress Frances Fisher, a member of SAG-AFTRA's National Board who told The Times she proposed Scott reach out directly to the union’s president, Gabrielle Carteris. Scott emailed her, relaying how she felt the union had let her down.  “Gabrielle got back to me that night thanking me for sharing this,” says Scott, who began to read aloud from Carteris’ email: “I am eager to hear how the Time’s Up will help on this issue. As for the union, I am making sure that this is reviewed as we continue developing best procedures and support systems.”  Through Greenwalt, Carteris declined to comment specifically on Scott’s case.  Bolstered by the quick response from Carteris, Scott decided to move forward with the member-to-member complaint, which she initiated on June 11. Two weeks later, she received a questionnaire in the mail asking her to recount her experience and share any witnesses and documentary evidence. She did that and sent the questionnaire back to the union the same day. Speaking out about this has been extraordinarily difficult for me, and now I understand why so many people don’t.  By the end of August, she had heard nothing — not even an acknowledgement that the paperwork was received. On Aug. 26, she filed a police report with Officer Brent Zuber at the Hermosa Beach Police Department.  "Since I wasn't interested in pursuing any kind of civil case, I felt it was one of my duties to go on record in this way,” Scott says. (The Hermosa Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.)  Hoping to receive an update from SAG-AFTRA, Scott messaged Carteris, who said she would check on the status of the complaint. The following day, Scott was informed that her case would be heard by the guild’s disciplinary committee on Oct. 26. (According to the guild, “hearings are not granted unless staff believes there is probable cause.”)  That committee would decide if Pardue should be expelled or suspended from the guild, which would mean loss of work and possibly health insurance, or sanctioned another way.  In mid-October, Barkoff, learning that Scott did not have a lawyer, secured Atkinson’s representation for her without the retainer. By that time, the SAG-AFTRA hearing was just days away, and Atkinson was unable to travel at the last-minute from her office in Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.  Both parties jointly agreed to enter mediation, which meant the hearing was postponed. If either side is dissatisfied with the mediation process, they can still proceed with the guild hearing.  Jonathan Steinsapir, Pardue's attorney, says his client "would welcome a SAG hearing or any other fair process to resolve this matter."  “I am disappointed that Kip has chosen to hide behind his actions,” Scott says. “Speaking out about this has been extraordinarily difficult for me, and now I understand why so many people don’t. My goal remains the same — my wish is for Kip to take full responsibility for all of his actions.”  Despite close to six months of regular phone calls with lawyers, SAG-AFTRA officials and other industry support staff, Scott says she remained hopeful that sharing her story might create change in the entertainment business.  “In Hollywood terms, I am not a name, but I am a working actress,” she says. “This is how I make my money, and help support my family. I’ve been out in Los Angeles pounding the pavement as a proud union member for 15 years. I was sexually violated while at work, and even though I had the courage to tell anyone and everyone who’d listen, as time went on it seemed like I had very little control in truly preventing this from happening to anyone else.”  ALSO:  Time's Up has kept #MeToo in the spotlight and raised $22 million.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-brett-ratner-allegations-20171101-htmlstory.html---split---By Amy Kaufman and Daniel Miller Nov. 1, 2017 Natasha Henstridge was watching a movie on Brett Ratner’s couch when she fell asleep. She was a 19-year-old fashion model; he was an up-and-coming music video director in his early 20s. They had been hanging out in front of the TV with friends at his New York apartment. But when Henstridge woke up, the others had left. She was alone with Ratner. She got up to leave, Henstridge said, but he blocked the doorway with his body and wouldn’t budge. He began touching himself, she said, then forced her to perform oral sex. “He strong-armed me in a real way. He physically forced himself on me,” she said. “At some point, I gave in and he did his thing.” Ratner, through his attorney Martin Singer, disputed her account. Since that incident in the early 1990s, Henstridge has found success as an actress — starring in the films “Species” and “The Whole Nine Yards.” But she said she has carried the memory of the run-in with her, and watched from afar as Ratner became one of Hollywood’s most powerful players — directing, producing or financing dozens of today’s biggest box-office hits, including “Rush Hour,” “X-Men: The Last Stand,” “The Revenant” and “Horrible Bosses.” ALSO: Warner Bros. cuts ties with Brett Ratner’s company » As hundreds of women have come forward in recent weeks with allegations of sexual misconduct at the hands of producer Harvey Weinstein, director James Toback and numerous other powerful men, Henstridge decided she would no longer remain silent. In interviews with the Los Angeles Times, Henstridge and five other women accused Ratner of a range of sexual harassment and misconduct that allegedly took place in private homes, on movie sets or at industry events. As is often the case, none of the women reported the allegations to the police. On Ratner’s behalf, Singer “categorically” disputed their accounts. “I have represented Mr. Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment,” Singer said in a 10-page letter to The Times. “Furthermore, no woman has ever requested or received any financial settlement from my client.” It feels as if I keep going up against the same bully at school who just won't quit. Actress Olivia Munn Olivia Munn said that while visiting the set of the 2004 Ratner-directed “After the Sunset” when she was still an aspiring actress, he masturbated in front of her in his trailer when she went to deliver a meal. Munn wrote about the incident in her 2010 collection of essays without naming Ratner. On a television show a year later, Ratner identified himself as the director, and claimed that he had “banged” her, something he later said was not true. The same year her book was published, Munn ran into Ratner at a party thrown by Creative Artists Agency and he boasted of ejaculating on magazine covers featuring her image, she told The Times. She said that persistent false rumors that they had been intimate have infuriated her, prompting her to talk to The Times in support of other women who are “brave enough to speak up.” “I've made specific, conscientious choices not to work with Brett Ratner,” Munn said. “It feels as if I keep going up against the same bully at school who just won't quit,” she said. “You just hope that enough people believe the truth and for enough time to pass so that you can't be connected to him anymore.” Ratner “vehemently disputes” Munn’s allegations, Singer said. Ratner, 48, has long flaunted his playboy persona, bragging publicly about his sexual prowess. He has been romantically linked to the likes of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Mariah Carey. In December, Tina Fey, speaking at the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Women in Entertainment breakfast, cracked: “Brett Ratner is here. In his defense, he thought this was a thing where you could eat breakfast off of 100 women.” For years, he palled around with Robert Evans, the slick-haired former production chief at Paramount Pictures who was later convicted of trafficking cocaine, and Toback, who, as The Times reported last month, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 300 women. In a January interview with Variety, Ratner said Evans, Toback and Roman Polanski, who was convicted of having unlawful sex with a minor in 1977, were among his “closest friends.” After Ratner quipped that “rehearsal is for fags” while appearing at a 2011 screening of his film “Tower Heist,” he was widely criticized. The misstep cost him a plum gig: He quickly resigned from producing the 2012 Academy Awards telecast and issued an apology, calling it a “dumb way of expressing myself.” In interviews, Ratner has tried to smooth out the rough edges of his bad-boy image, especially more recently, as he has expanded his business ventures. In 2012, Ratner co-founded production company RatPac Entertainment. A year later, RatPac partnered with now-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s Dune Entertainment to create the investment vehicle RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which inked a co-financing deal with Warner Bros. worth about $450 million. Among Ratner’s executive producing credits via those companies are “Jersey Boys” and “Black Mass.” The filmmaker often has told reporters that he doesn’t use drugs or drink alcohol. Sometimes, in enumerating his lack of vices, Ratner also points out his love of beautiful women, saying, for example, in a 2008 Jewish Journal story: “I'm not into dark stuff. I'm just a nice Jewish kid ... who loves movies and pretty girls." Actress Jaime Ray Newman said Ratner put it more bluntly to her, explaining in vulgar terms that he needed sex — not alcohol or drugs. Newman said she encountered Ratner in 2005 when they were both in first class on an Air Canada flight. The filmmaker swapped seats with his assistant before departure so he could be next to her, she said. Newman, who was on her way to shoot her first major acting role on the TV show “Supernatural,” was excited to talk with a “famous director” about to helm “X-Men: The Last Stand,” she said. Within five minutes of the plane taking off, she said, Ratner began loudly describing sex acts he wanted to perform on her in explicit detail. He also showed her nude photos of his then-girlfriend, said Newman, 39, who stars on Netflix’s forthcoming “The Punisher.” “He was graphically describing giving me oral sex and how he was addicted to it,” she said. Newman said she was so shaken by the encounter that she immediately told a handful of people about it. Both her mother and a friend confirmed to The Times that the actress shared details shortly after the flight. Ratner, through his attorney, denied that the incident occurred, referring to it as a “ridiculous claim.” Actress Katharine Towne also described an aggressive come-on by Ratner that left her so uncomfortable that she said she still vividly remembers the incident years later. She said she met the director in L.A. around 2005 at a party in a movie star’s home, where he made unwanted advances. Ratner, she said, was persistent, “making it evident that he had one motive” — to sleep with her. “He started to come on to me in a way that was so extreme,” said Towne, 39, whose credits include the film “What Lies Beneath.” The actress, who is the daughter of “Chinatown” screenwriter Robert Towne, excused herself. Ratner followed her into a bathroom. “I think it’s pretty aggressive to go in the bathroom with someone you don’t know and close the door,” Towne said. She said she was nervous, and tried to make a joke about her weight: “I don’t even know what you want with me. I’m kind of chubby right now.” He was undeterred. “I like ’em chubby sometimes,” she said Ratner replied. Towne gave Ratner her number, hoping to placate him. Ratner’s assistant called her for the next six months, unsuccessfully trying to arrange a dinner for her and the filmmaker, she said. Ratner’s attorney Singer called Towne’s account “absurd.” “Even if hypothetically this incident occurred exactly as claimed, how is flirting at a party, complimenting a woman on her appearance, and calling her to ask her for a date wrongful conduct?” Singer said. Although some have questioned his conduct, Ratner has defenders in the industry including five former assistants who have worked closely with him throughout the years. David Steiman, Hopi Dobuler, Drew Sherman, Brett Gursky and Izak Rappaport all said that they did not witness him misbehave and praised him as a boss and mentor. Steiman, who was Ratner’s assistant from 1999 to 2004, said he never saw him mistreat women, and would be "shocked" if such conduct occurred. Steiman noted that Ratner dated actress Rebecca Gayheart and tennis star Serena Williams during his time working for the filmmaker. Said Dobuler, a longtime former assistant to Ratner: “I think he’s great. ... He’s a family guy.” Over the years, Ratner has received several honors for his philanthropic and humanitarian endeavors. On Sunday, the Jewish National Fund presented Ratner with its annual Tree of Life Award at a gala in Hollywood where the guests included film producer Avi Lerner, United Talent Agency co-founder Jim Berkus and Singer. Gal Gadot, the Israeli star of “Wonder Woman,” had been slated to give the award to Ratner, but as The Times was reporting on his alleged sexual misbehavior last week, the actress’ publicist announced she would not appear at the event because of a scheduling conflict. Instead, "Wonder Woman" director Patty Jenkins, who has known Ratner for years, presented him the award, saying: "He’s gone on to be this real power in this town. He’s a big character. He’s a big personality. But you know what I love about Brett, he wants that for everybody else too." New to Los Angeles and pursuing an acting career, Munn said she was thrilled when a friend invited her to the set of "After the Sunset.” "I was so excited, because I mean, that's why you come out to California and Hollywood," recalled the actress, 37, whose credits now include HBO's "The Newsroom" and the movies "Magic Mike” and "X-Men: Apocalypse." Not long after Munn arrived on the Santa Monica set in 2004, she said, she was asked to drop some food off in Ratner's trailer as a favor. She said she was assured that the director would not be there. Munn entered Ratner’s trailer and quickly placed the food on a table. She said she was startled to find him inside. She tried to make a quick exit, but Ratner implored her not to leave. "He walked out ... with his belly sticking out, no pants on, shrimp cocktail in one hand and he was furiously masturbating in the other," Munn said. "And before I literally could even figure out where to escape or where to look, he ejaculated." Munn said she let out a "startled scream" and raced out of the trailer. She said she immediately told the man who had asked her to deliver the food. His reaction? “It wasn't a shock. It wasn't surprise,” Munn recalled. “It was just, ‘Ugh, sorry about that.’" Munn said she left the set and called her sister, Sara Potts, who urged her to speak with a lawyer. Potts confirmed Munn’s account. The attorney dissuaded her from going up against a powerful director as a fledgling actress, so she did nothing. “That did leave an impact on me,” Munn said, reflecting on the conversation. "How broken do women have to be before people listen?" She wrote about the incident in her book, “Suck It, Wonder Woman! The Misadventures of a Hollywood Geek” — but stripped out names and details. During a 2011 appearance on “Attack of the Show,” a television program Munn previously co-hosted, Ratner identified himself as the unnamed director, but denied masturbating in front of her. “I used to date Olivia Munn, I will be honest with everybody here,” he said. “When she was ‘Lisa.’ That was the problem. She wasn’t Asian back then.” “I banged her a few times ... but I forgot her,” he said. Days later, he went on the Howard Stern show and admitted he never slept with Munn and expressed contrition for making her look like “a whore.” “I felt horrible,” he told the Sirius XM Radio host. “I said I banged her three times, which wasn’t true.” In response to questions from The Times, Singer said that Munn and Ratner had indeed had “an intimate relationship.” Munn described that as “a complete lie.” “I shouldn’t have to be completely broken, battered, and devalued in order to prove that he crossed a line,” she said. I shouldn’t have to be completely broken, battered, and devalued in order to prove that he crossed a line. Olivia Munn Munn said she continued to run into Ratner at a handful of Hollywood events. In 2010, after recently appearing on the cover of a magazine, she attended a CAA-hosted party where, she said, Ratner asked her, "Why do you hate me?" She said she told him: "It's more of a dislike." Ratner grew angry, she said, and responded: “Why? I bought 10 of your magazines and came over all of them.” Singer said Ratner “has no recollection of making such a statement.” Immediately after the run-in, Munn told her friend Cara McConnell, whom she had brought to the party, about what transpired. “She came up to me right afterwards,” McConnell said. “She [said] ‘I can’t believe this happened to me. I can’t believe he did that.’” An actor who overheard the conversation confirmed Munn’s account. A third partygoer confirmed being told immediately about the “vulgar” encounter from someone who overheard it directly. The claimed incident with Munn is not the only one to allegedly occur on set of a Ratner-helmed film. Four people who were involved in the production of Ratner’s “Rush Hour 2” in Las Vegas in 2001 described a sexually charged atmosphere — one in which the director was pursuing women. The PG-13 film includes several scenes featuring women in bikinis and lingerie, and the set, according to these people, was teeming with beautiful young women. Eri Sasaki, then a 21-year-old part-time model and aspiring singer, said her role as an extra required her to wear a skimpy outfit that exposed her midriff. While waiting for filming to begin one day, Ratner approached her, ran his index finger down her bare stomach and asked if she wanted to go into a bathroom with him. When she said no, she recalled Ratner saying, "Don't you want to be famous?" A day or two later, Ratner again asked her to go into the bathroom with him, and again asked if she wanted to be a movie star. He offered to give her a line of dialogue in the film. Sasaki said no. Singer said Ratner has no recollection of the alleged incident. Jorina King also worked as a background actress on the film. On the first day of shooting, King said, Ratner plucked her from a crowd of female extras and said he later wanted to discuss giving her a speaking part. The next day, he asked her to come to his trailer and told her he needed to see her breasts, she said. King said she rejected his request and hid in a restroom. “I figured if I could stay out of his eyesight, if I could stay away from him, he will forget about me and he will choose someone else, and that is exactly what happened,” King said, adding that she feared him — and losing the work. Kent Richards, who was a production assistant on the set of “Rush Hour 2,” said that Sasaki told him, during the production, about her experience with Ratner. He also said he recalled a conversation in which King expressed being uncomfortable on set, and referenced Ratner. Richards also said two or three other background actresses complained to him, alleging that Ratner asked them to show him their breasts or to touch his penis. Singer disputed Richards’ account, calling it a “secondhand story about unnamed individuals.” David Anthony, whose company at the time, Background Players, handled extras casting for the film’s shoot in L.A. and Las Vegas, said that three background actresses who worked on the project told him that Ratner had asked them out on “dates.” “In Brett’s defense, I am sure he is not the only heterosexual man hitting on women on that set,” he said. King, who later founded the background casting agency Wild Streak Talent, said that she’d dealt with brusque men on movie sets, but nothing like Ratner. “He feels entitled, that this is what he wants, this is how it is going to be, and this feels like normal business to him,” she said. Singer called King’s claims “absurd” and “nonsensical.” “The movie was obviously already cast and shooting, so the notion that there would be a discussion of getting her a speaking role in the middle of a movie shoot is ridiculous,” Singer said. He provided a statement by James M. Freitag, an assistant director on the set, who said that he received no such complaints during “Rush Hour 2” filming. “Any complaints of any kind including sexual harassment would be immediately directed to my attention,” Freitag said. “There were no complaints reported to me whatsoever.” Since their encounter in New York in the 1990s, Henstridge, 43, has crossed paths with Ratner numerous times in Hollywood, including once during the last ten years at a party with her friend Amy Del Rio. "She saw someone in the crowd and her body language changed," said Del Rio, an entertainment lawyer. "I asked her if she was OK and she said 'no.' Then I saw she was looking at Brett Ratner. I asked if she knew him. She said, 'He's not a good guy. I knew him back in the day in New York.' She was really weird, like, 'I wanna get out of here.'" Henstridge detailed the alleged encounter with Ratner to Del Rio only within the last month. But three other people — a former boyfriend, a neighbor and a close friend — confirmed to The Times that Henstridge told them about the incident over a roughly 10-year period beginning in the mid-1990s. Although he acknowledged spending time with her, Ratner disputed Henstridge’s claims. Singer accused the actress of being “upset after learning my client had a girlfriend who he would not leave” for her. Henstridge told The Times that she was not interested in dating Ratner and, before that night, had never been alone with him. Henstridge’s neighbor Lilith Berdischewsky said that the actress told her about the incident with Ratner in the mid-2000s. “I remember when she was going to some audition and she says, ‘I don’t know whether I should go or not, but [Ratner] probably is not going to be there.’ And she came back and she was shaking,” Berdischewsky recalled. Indeed, Henstridge, who recently appeared on the television shows “Medinah” and “Beauty & the Beast,” went to an audition for the TV drama "Prison Break," which Ratner executive produced, knowing he might be in the room. "And he was," said the actress, who has two sons, ages 16 and 19. "I had two young kids and had to go to work and make a living. And he just acted like we were old friends from back in the day in New York, saying, 'I haven't seen you in years.' Auditioning is already bad enough. But trying to focus on the work, I just felt sick." She didn’t get the part. amy.kaufman@latimes.com @AmyKinLA daniel.miller@latimes.com @danielnmiller Times staff writers Victoria Kim, Andrew Khouri and Glenn Whipp contributed to this report.

LOS ANGELES — More than 700,000 immigrants are waiting on applications to become U.S. citizens, a process that once typically took about six months but has stretched to more than two years in some places under the administration of President Donald Trump. The long wait times have prompted some immigrant advocates to ask whether the delays are aimed at keeping anti-Trump voters from casting ballots in elections. "People are motivated to participate, and they're being frustrated from being able to participate in the elections they're excited about," said Manuel Pastor, director of the Univers... Goop, the wellness empire launched by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, has found itself in hot water once again, just months after settling a six-figure lawsuit over a trio of controversial products. The company has been reported to British regulators for breaking U.K. advertising laws a whopping 113 times, according to The Sunday Times. Red flags were reportedly raised by the charity Good Thinking Society, which specifically called out a select few problematic products, including the Mother Load vitamin supplement packets.

More than 100 firefighters and emergency medical officials responded to the scene. The blaze was put under control within an hour, a department spokesman said.

How do you solve a problem like Apu? If you’re “The Simpsons,” you get rid of him entirely. That seems to be the long-running Fox comedy’s plan for the controversial character, at least according to an outside producer who’d had hopes of taking the Indian-American Kwik-E-Mart owner in a different direction. Adi Shankar told IndieWire that he launched a spec script contest earlier this year in order to find a solution for the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, who has faced backlash for pushing negative stereotypes of Indian-Americans. Shankar said he eventually found the “perfect script” ... CHICAGO – Sam Darnold was stuck in quicksand with a depleted supported cast devoid of game changers in a 24-10 loss to the Bears on Sunday. Gang Green’s offense sputtered for the better part of a miserable afternoon that dropped them to 3-5 at the midway point for the third consecutive season. Darnold was either running for his life, searching for receivers, who frankly, weren’t open or starting the play over after a litany of pre-snap penalties. Basically, nothing worked.

Two victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were killed in the same building where they said their vows to each other 62 years ago. Bernice and Sylvan Simon were two of 11 people who were fatally shot Saturday in the Tree of Life synagogue, where they were married in 1956. "They held hands and they always smiled and he would open the door for her, all those things that you want from another person," neighbor Heather Abraham told TribLive. "They were really generous and nice to everybody. It’s just horrific." Bernice, who was 84, and the 86-year-old Sylvan were wed in a candlelight cere... Thousands of Central American migrants took a break Sunday on their long journey through southern Mexico, but vowed to press ahead toward the U.S. border roughly 1,000 miles away, with Mexican government agencies seeming to waver between helping and hindering. Some rested in the shade of tarps strung across the town plaza, or picked up trash. Others went to soak themselves in the nearby Novillero river. The tensions of a long trek through searing heat with tenuous supplies of food and other goods spilled over Saturday night when a dispute over a food line evolved into the beating of a man f...
---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims-2-134502378.html---split---Eight men and three women, ranging in age from 97 to 54, were killed at a crowded Pittsburgh synagogue after a gunman opened fire on the congregation during Saturday services, officials have announced. Allegheny County medical examiner Karl Williams named the victims at a news conference Sunday morning: Joyce Feinberg, 75 Richard Gottfried, 65 Rose Mallinger, 97 Jerry Rabinowitz, 66 Brothers Cecil, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54 Husband and wife Sylvan, 86, and Bernice Simon, 84 Daniel Stein, 71 Melvin Wax, 88 Irving Youngner, 69 Williams said that the victims’ families had been notified and are “in shock and grieving.” Their bodies are undergoing autopsies, and authorities are “doing everything in our power that honors both civil and religious law,” he said. It could take up to a week to finish processing the crime scene, given that bodies were found in three different locations, Williams said. “There are shell casings everywhere,” he said. Feinberg, a mother of two sons, leaves behind several grandchildren, reported The Associated Press. Before she retired in 2008, she was a longtime researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center. “Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being,” Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, Feinberg’s former research partner, told the AP. Rabinowitz was a doctor, cat lover and “the kindest person you could dream of meeting,” his friend, Anna Boswell-Levy, said in a Facebook post. “He was such a good and caring man,” added Lisa Wesson-Richardson, one of his employees. “This is such huge loss to his family, his staff and his patients!” Stein, a retired plumbing salesman as well as a husband, father of two and grandfather of one, attended Shabbat services every Saturday morning, his nephew, Steven Halle, told WPXI News on Saturday. “Everybody loved him, there wasn’t one person that didn’t like him in the community,” Halle said. Wax, a retired accountant, was “such a kind, kind person,” Myron Snider, chairman of the congregation’s cemetery committee, told the AP. “When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them,” Snider said. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die,” before carrying out the attack, according to police sources. Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges against him on Saturday evening, 22 of which could result in him being sentenced to death. Bowers brought three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle into the synagogue, all of which he used in the massacre, Williams said. He’s expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. A Torah study and Shabbat services were scheduled at the synagogue on Saturday. During the shooting, a bris ― a Jewish circumcision ceremony for an infant boy ― was reportedly taking place at the Tree of Life synagogue. Six people, including four police officers, were injured. One officer has been released from hospitalization and officials said a second one is expected to be released sometime on Sunday. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” Hayley Miller contributed reporting. This story has been updated with details on some of the victims.

FOR THE LATEST NEWS ON THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE MASS SHOOTING, DOWNLOAD THE WPXI NEWS APP The Jewish faith’s weekly prayer services are held on Saturday mornings for the weekly observance of Shabbat, which honors the seventh day when God rested after creating the Earth in the Old Testament. RELATED STORIES: Shabbat is observed from sundown Friday until sundown on Saturday. Prayer services are usually held on Friday nights and Saturday mornings, with Saturday afternoon and evening reserved for studying and spending time with family. The entire family is expected to attend Shabbat services, which involve prayer and reading from the Torah, the Jewish faith’s interpretation of the Old Testament. Services can last up to a couple of hours, depending on the congregation and time of year. Channel 11 reported a bris was taking place at Tree of Life when the shooting occurred.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.ap.org/explore/---split---For nearly 170 years, The Associated Press has witnessed war, peace and everything in between. While the world watches, we report. Student-on-student sexual assault is not just a problem on college campuses. It threatens thousands of kids a year in elementary, middle and high schools across America. Rich or poor, urban or rural, no type of school is immune. For the women and girls of Pakistan, “honor” can be deadly. They may be killed for something as simple as a glance at the wrong man, or as life-changing as trying to determine their own future. AP tells their stories. Americans are more divided than ever, gridlocked over social issues, race, gender and the economy. In this series, The Associated Press explores what divides us and how deep those divisions run. In the two years since the Islamic State began building its self-styled “caliphate,” it has killed thousands of people, displaced millions, forced the abandonment of entire villages, and taken over key cities in Syria and Iraq. Here, the AP chronicles the casualties of the IS war. Thailand is the world's third-largest seafood exporter. It's supply chain has been notoriously murky and is staffed largely by poor workers from neighboring regions. Many are tricked or coerced by brokers who sell them onto fishing boats. Sometimes they are even drugged and kidnapped. That's what four AP reporters found during an 18-month investigation into human trafficking and forced labor in Southeast Asia's seafood industry. The investigation started with a simple question: Could the catch from men enslaved on Thai fishing boats at sea be tracked to U.S. households? Forty years after the fall of Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City), Peter Arnett has written a new memoir, “Saigon Has Fallen.” Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the Vietnam War for The Associated Press and later gained fame as a correspondent for CNN. In this vivid recounting, Arnett describes his experience of reporting a war that divided Americans and altered the lives of those who covered it. The Berlin Wall, which had seemed as normal as the rising sun, came down 25 years ago on Nov. 9, 1989. AP’s Vienna Bureau Chief Alison Smale was well-positioned to witness the key moments leading to the fall of the wall. Explore and watch how AP and Smale report the story. “I grabbed that phone when it rang and Ike said, ‘Bob, the president has been shot!’ I said, ‘Ike, how do you know?’ He said, ‘I was shooting pictures then and I saw it. There was blood on his face. Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed him. She cried, ‘Oh no!’ And the motorcade raced on.’” Fifty years ago, on July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Explore the historic social movement, through AP’s coverage, leading up to this landmark legislation. Some were locked up when they were as young as 14 or 15, sentenced to life without parole for murder and other serious crimes committed as juveniles. Now dozens of former teen offenders are getting a shot at a second chance after Supreme Court rulings set out the possibility of freedom for these inmates, many now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The court says young offenders should be treated differently than adults. But prison gates don’t just swing open. Presidential hopefuls burn bright, then fade. Poll numbers rise and fall. Presidents pass the torch; administrations change. Through it all, one constant remains: The Associated Press’ coverage of the American president. Once among the richest and safest countries in Latin America, Venezuela is now falling apart. With a plunge in the price of oil and years of mismanagement, the economy is unraveling. Food is scarce. Crime is rampant. Hospitals barely work. And people are fighting desperately just to survive from day to day. The ’60s were powerful days. To say AP reporter Kathryn Johnson was unprepared for plunging into chaotic events is an understatement. She barely begun as a full-fledged Associated Press reporter when the civil rights struggle spread rapidly across the South. From dressing as a student during the integration of the University of Georgia to being trapped in a phone booth by several Ku Klux Klansmen, Johnson's courageous coverage brought the Civil Rights Movement in the south to the AP wires. Forty-five years ago, three Americans made history becoming the first to set foot on the moon. For the first time ever, explore AP’s coverage of the Space Race in the new eBook, ‘Footprints on the Moon,’ available now. Seventy years ago, Allied forces liberated Paris after four years of German occupation. To cover the Vietnam War, The Associated Press gathered an extraordinary group of superb photojournalists in its Saigon bureau, creating one of the greatest photographic legacies of the 20th century. Collected in “Vietnam: The Real War” are images that tell the story of a war that has left a deep and lasting impression on American life. The Associated Press had covered war before, but not since the Napoleonic wars a century earlier had so many armies battled to so great an extent. Fifty years ago, on June 11, 1963, AP Saigon correspondent Malcolm Browne shook the world with his picture of the ritual suicide by fire of a Buddhist monk in protest against South Vietnam’s repressive U.S.-backed regime. The court says young offenders should be treated differently than adults. But prison gates don’t just swing open. Analyzing information from state education agencies and federal crime data, AP found about 17,000 official reports of sexual assaults by students over a four-year period.

Thailand is the world's third-largest seafood exporter. It's supply chain has been notoriously murky and is staffed largely by poor workers from neighboring regions. Many are tricked or coerced by brokers who sell them onto fishing boats. Sometimes they are even drugged and kidnapped. That's what four AP reporters found during an 18-month investigation into human trafficking and forced labor in Southeast Asia's seafood industry. The investigation started with a simple question: Could the catch from men enslaved on Thai fishing boats at sea be tracked to U.S. households? Forty years after the fall of Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City), Peter Arnett has written a new memoir, “Saigon Has Fallen.” Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the Vietnam War for The Associated Press and later gained fame as a correspondent for CNN. In this vivid recounting, Arnett describes his experience of reporting a war that divided Americans and altered the lives of those who covered it. The Berlin Wall, which had seemed as normal as the rising sun, came down 25 years ago on Nov. 9, 1989. AP’s Vienna Bureau Chief Alison Smale was well-positioned to witness the key moments leading to the fall of the wall. Explore and watch how AP and Smale report the story. “I grabbed that phone when it rang and Ike said, ‘Bob, the president has been shot!’ I said, ‘Ike, how do you know?’ He said, ‘I was shooting pictures then and I saw it. There was blood on his face. Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed him. She cried, ‘Oh no!’ And the motorcade raced on.’” The Associated Press had covered war before, but not since the Napoleonic wars a century earlier had so many armies battled to so great an extent. Fifty years ago, on July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

To cover the Vietnam War, The Associated Press gathered an extraordinary group of superb photojournalists in its Saigon bureau, creating one of the greatest photographic legacies of the 20th century. Collected in “Vietnam: The Real War” are images that tell the story of a war that has left a deep and lasting impression on American life. Fifty years ago, on June 11, 1963, AP Saigon correspondent Malcolm Browne shook the world with his picture of the ritual suicide by fire of a Buddhist monk in protest against South Vietnam’s repressive U.S.-backed regime.

But as the nation comes to grips with yet another mass murder carried out by an angry man with a deadly weapon, it is perhaps time to review how often Americans turn to guns to express discontent, hate and prejudice against their compatriots. In 2018 alone, including the most recent carnage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, there have been 47,220 gun-related incidents resulting in 11,984 deaths in the United States, according to data compiled by Gun Violence Archive, an independent data-collection and research group. That breaks down to 157 incidents and 40 deaths a day and does not include 22,000 suicides. Of the total fatalities, 548 were children, while 2,321 were teenagers. GVA defines gun incidents as all types of shootings, including officer involved, accidental, children shooting themselves, murders, armed robberies, mass shootings, home Invasions and drivebys. “Only by being totally inclusionary in our definitions is our data accurate, allowing the researcher to decide which parts of the complete dataset they need for their work. Our goal is to provide a complete picture of impact,” said the group in a statement on its website. There are, of course, arguments from staunch gun-rights supporters that an armed citizenry is a safer citizenry. Nothing stops a bad guy with a gun like a good guy with a gun, is a popular National Rifle Association talking point. And President Donald Trump pondered aloud on Saturday whether guns inside the synagogue might have led to a less tragic outcome. President Trump, asked about gun laws, says the Pittsburgh synagogue should have had armed security at the bris and the gunman wouldn’t be able to do what he did pic.twitter.com/y9Cq59wPM5 But among the 2018 shooting incidents, only 1,478 cases, or 3.1% of the total, involved the defensive use of weapons. In Pittsburgh, at least 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue by a suspect shouting, “All Jews must die,” according to KDKA. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-report-20181027-story.html---split---Lonzo Ball kept the starting point guard job Saturday, getting the nod over Rajon Rondo, but perhaps left the door open with a “bad game” against the San Antonio Spurs while Rondo made a push to reclaim the position. While Rondo was serving his three-game suspension for spitting and fighting with Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul, Ball had started and played well. So coach Luke Walton kept Ball in the starting lineup Saturday. But Ball had just six points on two-for-eight shooting, three assists and two rebounds in almost 27 minutes. “I didn’t play well tonight,” Ball acknowledged. “Bad game. I’m human. I don’t play good every game.” Ball was asked if Walton gave the second-year guard more confidence about starting in the future. “I’m not sure,” Ball said. “Whatever he decides. Tonight I got the start.” Rondo had 12 points off the bench. He was four for eight from the field and had five assists and four rebounds. “I’m just happy to be back on the court playing with my guys,” Rondo said. “We didn’t get the win so it was disappointing.” The Lakers play at Minnesota on Monday night, giving Walton a day to make another decision on who will be his starting point guard. “Doesn’t matter who starts. They are both fine either way,” Walton said. “They just want to win, is what they told me. They know that the decision is made by the coaching staff and they support each other and whatever it is they’ll go out and do their job.” Walton offers support for victims A somber Walton opened his pregame remarks offering his support for victims of the shooting Saturday in Pittsburgh at a synagogue that left at least 11 people dead and six wounded. “Let’s take a moment to give our thoughts and our prayers and our love to those out in Pittsburgh,” Walton said. “That’s terrible and I can’t imagine what those people are going through, but sending our respect and our love to them. It feels right, for what it’s worth.” Walton paused for a moment before continuing. “It’s sad that there’s so much hatred in the world right now,” Walton said. “I don’t know what the solution is, but we as people need to figure it out.” Etc. Walton said both Rondo and Brandon Ingram were in Phoenix on Wednesday night while serving their suspension for their roles in the fight with Houston and participated in workouts before they had to depart the arena. Ingram, who finished serving his four-game suspension Saturday, was here in San Antonio and at the team hotel. He’ll fly with the Lakers to Minneapolis on Sunday and will be available to play Monday night against the Timberwolves. ... The Spurs’ Gregg Popovich became the fifth NBA coach to win 1,200 games and the first to do so with one team.
---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-rockets-takeaways-20181021-story.html#nt=barker---split---Five takeaways from the fight-marred game that the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets. 1. Spitgate! Both teams are taking their own player’s side on whether or not Lakers guard Rajon Rondo spit in the face of Rockets guard Chris Paul, and both L.A. and Houston say they have video evidence to prove their claims. Sources close to Rondo said the Lakers looked at the video of the incident that took place with four minutes, 13 seconds left in the fourth quarter five times and never saw him spit in the face of Paul. The Rockets contend they have video evidence of Paul being spit on by Rondo and that’s why Houston’s point guard reacted so violently and put his finger in Rondo’s face. Rondo responded by throwing a punch that connected with Paul’s face. Paul threw punches at Rondo and then all hell broke loose. The ESPN crew that televised the game Saturday night at Staples Center said Paul told them Rondo spit in his face. Rondo was adamant in telling the Lakers that he did not spit in Paul’s face. LeBron James, who is close friends with Paul, wrapped his arm around Paul and tried to be the peacemaker. “I just tried to calm things down, that’s all,” James said after the Lakers lost 124-115 to the Rockets. “Play basketball.” Both Rondo and Paul were ejected from the game. Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA’s executive vice president of basketball operations, was at the game Saturday night sitting in the stands. He for sure will be handing out suspension soon to Rondo and Paul for their fight. The Rockets play the Clippers tonight at Staples Center and the Lakers next play the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night at Staples Center. 2. As he was getting dressed late Saturday night after he had been ejected from the game, a much calmer Brandon Ingram walked over to James and the two shook hands. Ingram had been involved in an earlier altercation in the fourth quarter. After he had been called for a foul on James Harden, Ingram pushed Harden in the back. Still unhappy about the call, the 6-feet-9 Ingram then stood over and glared at referee Jason Phillips face-to-face. Ingram had to be pulled away by Lakers teammate Lance Stephenson. Ingram was hit with a technical foul for shoving Harden. A few seconds later, while Rondo and Paul were mixing it up, Ingram ran in from half court and threw a punch at Paul. Ingram was given two technical fouls and ejected from the game too. And, he’s probably looking at the longest suspension of the group for escalating matters. James, who has become a mentor to Ingram, supported his young teammate. “I love BI and in my small time with him so far, I am with him throughout whatever,” James said. 3. In his first regular season game at Staples Center, James was not at his best. He had 24 points, but he was just nine-for-22 from the field, one-for-seven from three-point range. He was a minus-13 in the plus-minus category. James did have five rebounds and five assists. 4. The Lakers were down 109-108 before things went crazy, before Ingram fouled Harden on a drive to the basket and subsequently pushed him in the back and before the fight broke out between Rondo and Paul. But the Lakers were unable to stop the Rockets after things settled down and both teams resumed playing basketball. Harden finished the game with 36 points and Paul had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. Ingram had 12 points, Rondo 13 points and 10 assists and Lonzo Ball had 14 points. “Listen, we had our chances tonight and we will take this opportunity tonight to go over things we could do more, did better, be frustrated at certain things we did, look back on things,” James said. “But when you wake up tomorrow, it’s a new day. It’s a new opportunity and you leave things in the past and get on with the future. Tonight, whenever time guys go to bed, when they wake up tomorrow, they got a fresh mind and they can move on.” 5. For the second straight game, the Lakers were horrible from the three-point line. They made just eight of their 32 three-pointers, for 25%. Ingram missed his only three-pointer, James was one for seven, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed his three attempts, Rondo was one for two, Kyle Kuzma was one for five, Josh Hart was one for five, Ball was four-for-eight and Stephenson missed his only attempt. “Miss some, make some,” Kuzma said about his team’s three-point shooting woes. “It’s important to be confident and just keep shooting them.”
---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-sidebar-20101020-story.html#nt=barker---split---With a confident look in his eyes, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope stepped up to shoot the technical-foul free throw for the Lakers in the second quarter of their home opener against the Houston Rockets at Staples Center on Saturday night. Caldwell-Pope missed. It was that kind of night for him and it’s been that way for Caldwell-Pope from the exhibition season through his first two games with the Lakers. His offense has not quite caught up to his solid defense, his shots betraying him seemingly at every turn. Nevertheless, Caldwell-Pope remains assured of what his role will be for the Lakers this season. “My role is pretty much how I built my career,” Caldwell-Pope said. “I established myself on the defensive end. I get myself involved by getting my hands on balls. I think my offense is just part of it. But my role is to be a very good defender for this team.” Right now, he can’t get his offense uncorked as the starting shooting guard. During the exhibition season, Caldwell-Pope shot only 25% from three-point range and averaged 9.8 points per game. He shot 38.3% from three-point range last season for the Lakers and averaged 13.4 points. He missed his first four shots against the Rockets in the first half, and three of those were three-pointers. But he’s stuck with it, finally scoring in the third quarter by making a back-door cut and scoring on a layup off a pass from LeBron James. A few seconds later, though, Caldwell-Pope missed a pull-up jumper. Still, to his credit, he kept running and cutting to the basket and staying involved in the game. It paid off when he slipped back door and scored off a pass from Rajon Rondo while being fouled. Caldwell-Pope made the free throw for a three-point play. “I just feel like I have to get in the flow of the game,” he said. “I didn’t get that many shots in the first game in Portland Thursday night, but I felt like I was playing well on the defensive end. I was moving and cutting on offense, which allowed my teammates to get wide-open shots.” Caldwell-Pope’s main assignment against the Rockets was to defend the dangerous James Harden, who finished with 36 points. Harden had 25 points through the first three quarters with Caldwell-Pope and other defenders trying to guard the NBA’s most valuable player from last season. Caldwell-Pope finished with five points on two-for-eight shooting. But more than anything else, he kept his head in the game even when his offense wasn’t what he wanted it to be. “He impacts the game defensively,” Lakers coach Luke Walton said. “When he’s locked in and going, the way he hounds guards and fighting through screens and all those type of things, getting in the passing lane… Obviously it’s nice to see the ball go through. Everyone wants to see that. But he has the ability to impact it on both sides.”
---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-report-20181017-story.html---split---Damian Lillard never doubted LeBron James would sign with the Lakers. That didn’t lessen the impact when he did. “When he did it, I was like, ‘He really did it,” Lillard, smiling, said after practice Wednesday. Naturally, Lillard was asked why he automatically assumed James would sign a four-year, $153.3-million deal to join the Lakers and spurn the Cleveland Cavaliers team with which he had spent the last four seasons. “I mean, why wouldn’t you think it?” Lillard said. “You heard it everywhere: ‘Going to the Lakers!’ And then when it actually happened, I was like, ‘Wow! He signed with the Lakers.’ You know when you think something is going to happen and then when it actually happens, you kind of sit there and say, ‘OK, that’s it.’” The two have developed a friendship over the years, with Lillard saying he and James are simply “chopping it up like regular people.” When they exchanged texts this past summer, Lillard asked James for advice. “One time I asked him about his body maintenance,” Lillard said. “Stuff like that. Fifteen years (in the NBA) and he had his best year in his 15th year. I mean, it’s nothing crazy. It’s just regular conversation.” James doesn’t have much experience handling a Portland crowd, having spent most of his career in the Eastern Conference. But the time he spent there made an impression. On the court, their guards, Lillard and C.J. McCollum, impress him. “They’re two of the toughest 1-2 punches that we have in our league as far as point guards and shooting guards,” James said, immediately mentioning Golden State’s Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. “You put Steph and Klay at the top, you got Dame and CJ, John [Wall] and Brad Beal [in Washington]. You know a couple other guys as well but they’re just as tough as anybody.” James’ range On his Instagram account Tuesday night, James posted some film from practice. It was a play in a scrimmage that ended with James making a deep, off-balance three-pointer over Kyle Kuzma. James’ team was down three with seven seconds remaining. After he hit the shot, Lance Stephenson caught the rebound and motioned as if he was going to throw the ball at James. In his caption James indicated that Stephenson and Kuzma weren’t pleased about the play. James also made a three-pointer to close the first half of his final preseason game last week. Last season, he averaged five three-point attempts per game, which ranked 66th among players. Walton said he hasn’t seen James work too much on expanding his range. “One of the great things about the way he works is he’s always bringing in other guys in working with him, some of the younger guys, some of the vets, turning it into competitions,” Walton said. “If he’s gonna include other people in his workouts and they start shooting 38-footers as far as their drills, we’re gonna have to shut that down, have a talk.” Wagner will miss opener Lakers rookie forward Moe Wagner will miss Thursday’s season opener in Portland. Wagner has been progressing after sustaining a knee contusion in July. “He’s out there every day now, which is a great start for him, and getting reps,” Walton said. “He’s a really hard worker. He comes in before, stays after, just body feels good, it takes some time.” UP NEXT AT PORTLAND When: 7:30 p.m., Thursday. On Air: TV: TNT; Radio: 710. UPDATE: The Lakers have lost 15 consecutive games to the Trail Blazers. The Lakers averaged 108.1 points per game last season, 11th-best in the NBA, but they gave up 109.6 points per game, ranking them 25th. Portland has won 17 straight home openers. Portland forward Maurice Harkless is listed as probable for the game because of a left knee injury that kept him out of all five of the Trail Blazers’ preseason games.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pittsburgh-first-person-20181027-story.html#nt=related-content---split---We knew it could happen here — any here, anywhere — when we learned that nine people were killed three years ago in the historic Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. We knew it could happen here — any here, anywhere — when we learned that six were killed in the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City last year. Now we know it can happen here, and that here is anywhere. Here, this weekend, is Squirrel Hill, home of a dozen synagogues. For more than a century and a half, it not only is the spiritual center of Pittsburgh Judaism but also a vital landmark in the history of Jews in America, along with New York’s Lower East Side and Boston’s Blue Hill Avenue, one of the vital centers of Jewish identity since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. And here — amid the kosher grocery and the kosher restaurant and the kosher-style deli, and where the knotted fringes of tzitzit are familiar features at the corners of the garments of the Orthodox who walk through the area just before sundown Friday evenings — it didn’t require social media for the news of the shooting at the Tree of Life to spread. The news was in the air, along with the shock and the sadness, the grief and the gruesome details, the worst of which were confirmed within hours. You could hear it in the sirens that broke the stillness of the morning and shattered the serenity of the Saturday routines at the cleaners, at the shoe store, at the hotcake house. No need, of course, in a place like this to identify the name of the cleaners, the shoe store, the hotcake house. Everyone knows them, just as they know the names of almost everyone along Forbes Avenue at any time of the day. And precisely because everyone knows everyone around here — the one immutable Squirrel Hill truth that is at once irritating and comforting — what was on the street as noon approached Saturday was the dread that dared not speak its name. Dread that someone you knew was in morning prayers. Dread that the police officers who sped to the scene — truly there were scores of them, almost as if it were a police funeral, for it was clear that soon there could be one — were in danger. Dread, too, that our country, our city, our neighborhood, our lives have come to this, and that this has come home. Before long the whole tragic scene was on television, and there was David Johnson, the WPXI-TV anchor, on the sidewalk. He lives here, mere blocks away. On the screen, too, was Ken Rice, the KDKA-TV anchor. He and his wife, Lauren, took their pre-marriage lessons just down the street. Then there also was the downtown businessman, a Squirrel Hill resident since he was 3 days old — everyone knows his name, too, though he won’t permit it to be used in the paper — who was in the Five Points Bakery, hard by the synagogue. He was there to buy a morning muffin for his wife. But the line was too long so he headed back home, down Wilkins Avenue and toward Fifth, and this is what he saw: “There were four, maybe six officers, and they rushed into the synagogue with guns. Then I saw the officers start to fire and back out, and I saw what looked like gunfire from the synagogue. And I saw an officer holding his arm being escorted out. And the next thing I knew there were cops all over the place.’’ And the very next thing he did was call the executive editor of the Post-Gazette, because he knew I lived only three blocks away from the synagogue and he knew this was news, of the worst but most important kind. And soon Rabbi James A. Gibson of Temple Sinai, the Reform synagogue that is nearly a neighbor of Tree of Life, was on the phone. “We’re stunned that the peace of Shabbat was destroyed by murderous intent and act,’’ he said, the words spilling forth in a Niagara of disbelief unusual for a man of devout belief. ‘’We cannot comprehend what happened. It’s a tragedy for us all, and especially for those who are victims.’’ This was, to be sure, a 21st century event. Gunfire in a house of worship. Text messages flying at the speed of bullets. (Mine came from Saskatchewan and Alberta and Ontario; from a nephew at Yeshiva University in New York and brothers and my sister from Boston’s North Shore; and from neighbors the next street over.) And of course: confusion, and then clarity, over how many dead, how many wounded. And confusion, but no clarity, about what this means, and whether the toxic political and cultural environment caused this, or merely reflected it. But one thing had clarity. At a time of peril, in a period of media disruption, people turned to the much-maligned mainstream press to find out what happened, when they needed the news most, when it counted the most, when it didn’t matter whether you voted for Donald J. Trump or Hillary Rodham Clinton or what your definition of nationalism was. Changes in demographics, increased intermarriage, and the growth of the suburbs have diluted the Jewish identity of Squirrel Hill somewhat, but it remains true, as Steven R. Weisman — author of “The Chosen Wars,” the most recent history of Judaism in America — put it in a phone conversation only hours after the shooting, that ‘’the fabric of American Judaism is woven into Squirrel Hill.’’ Because this was our neighborhood, caught in the crossfire of the strains of the global village, and for once — sadly, so very sadly — the hurt was ours, and the victims were ours, and the need to heal is ours. For now it has happened here, and though we are the it-can-happen anywhere for millions across this wounded nation, we now know what it means when anywhere is right here. And in our grief — shared across all faiths — we might reflect on the passage from Proverbs that lent its name to this place of tragedy, a reference to the metaphor describing Judaism’s most sacred text, the Torah, as a tree of life, or, in transliterated Hebrew, Etz hayyim: It is a tree of life to all who hold fast to it; its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all it paths are peace. -- David Shribman is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and a resident of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

The streets were empty, as usual, but inside the nicely kept brick houses of this well-to-do neighbourhood, the centre of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, residents faced the inevitable question - do I know anyone? Many probably did, or at least knew someone who did. "You wouldn't expect it," said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lives just a few houses from the Tree of Life Congregation, where the deadly shooting took place. "It's very shocking because the neighbourhood is so loving and calm." More than a quarter of Pittsburgh's 50,000 Jewish adults and children live in Squirrel Hill, according to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania. Several temples from different Jewish denominations, kosher restaurants and local shops form what has been called a "vibrant oasis" of Judaism in the city. And so, when a gunman opened fire at a local synagogue, many felt that not only their religion was being attacked, but their own little haven. "It's a tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone," said Adam Hertzman, the federation's marketing director. "The whole Jewish community is shocked, [but] Jewish Pittsburgh is so close together, like a family, it will not change that." The attack - the darkest day of Pittsburgh's history, according to Mayor Bill Peduto - happened as worshippers gathered in a drizzly morning in different rooms at the congregation, home to three different synagogues. The larger one, Tree of Life, was set up in 1864. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, stormed the building and shot indiscriminately. During the attack, he reportedly shouted "All Jews must die". "I always knew there were people who hated Jewish people," said 16-year-old student Spencer Lieberman, who avoids wearing Jewish symbols in public, including his necklace with the Star of David. "But I never imagined anyone would do something like this." Eleven people, whose ages ranged from 54 to 97, were killed in the attack, including a couple and two brothers. Six others were injured, including four police officers who engaged in a gun battle with the suspect, and two members of the congregation. But for many in Squirrel Hill, and probably across the country, this is more than just tragedy coming to a small, close community. The attack happened amid a perceived rise in hate-related crimes nationwide and at the end of a particularly tense week in which more than a dozen explosive devices were sent to critics of President Donald Trump. Some have blamed the president himself for stirring divisions, claims he denies. He called the attack a "wicked act of mass murder". Mr Hertzman, who used to worship at the synagogue attacked and knew two of the dead, said: "We've certainly seen that anti-Semitism is on the rise across the US. I don't know if it's increased in Pittsburgh or we're just more aware of that." The gunman had posted anti-Semitic content on social network Gab under the username "onedingo", and the bio on his account, now suspended, read: "Jews are the children of Satan". Hours before attacking the synagogue on International Religious Freedom Day, he criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and said he could not "sit by and watch my people get slaughtered". "This shouldn't be happening," said 54-year-old resident Dan Berger. "Divisions have been big in the country. We should all be Americans and all these differences are dividing our country." Mr Bowers faces 29 criminal charges, including obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs, a hate crime, and using a firearm to commit murder. All of these can carry the death penalty. Throughout Sunday, dozens of residents and others brought flowers and candles to Tree of Life's entrance. They were adamant that the attack would not change this place. "[The attacker] was an anti-Semitic man but he seemed to be a hateful man," said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. "Hate is hate, is terrible and it doesn't have any place in our country, city or Squirrel Hill." Ms Butler's family of Orthodox Jews only found out about the shooting in the evening, as they do not use any electronic device, she said. They carried placards thanking the police for keeping "the Jews in [their] neighbourhood safe". "You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole," she said. "This has touched all of us."

---split---2.0---split---http://www.vulture.com/2018/10/shirkers-movie-review.html---split---More than once in Shirkers, Sandi Tan, or those once close to her, describe her as an “asshole.” As a young, wannabe creative genius, I spent an inordinate amount of time in my young adulthood parsing the word “asshole” as an insult. To me it connoted bossiness, self-absorption, an allergy to niceties that still somehow always felt redeemable. (“Fucking assholes” are a different story, there is very little hope for a fucking asshole.) Therefore, in a way it seemed kind of daring — especially for a woman, especially for an Asian woman — to be considered an “asshole.” I often described men I was attracted to as “assholes,” while also harboring some aspiration to be an asshole myself. These were simpler times, before social media came around to offer up more than my recommended daily intake of assholery, unsolicited. The right to be a female asshole, and the fleeting, shimmering product of the mind of such a teenage girl, is at the heart of Shirkers, a strange, engrossing, and often ravishingly beautiful auto-documentary written, directed, produced, and edited by Tan. The story of Tan’s lost titular road movie, which she wrote and starred in in the summer of 1992 when she was 19, is part thrilling meditation on youthful creativity and friendship, part vaguely sinister mystery, in which the biggest suspect is the explosive fragility of one man’s ego. Fans of the 2013 Swedish punk-girl comedy We Are the Best! will find some of that same rebellious spirit here, but for cinephiles there’s something even more endearing about young Tan’s chest-thumping insistence that she could be a big auteur name alongside Jarmusch and Herzog, and something deeply heartbreaking about how that dream was exhausted and thwarted over the years. Tan, along with her friends Jasmine Ng and Sophia Siddique, came up in the island nation of Singpore mainlining cinema and flexing their creative muscles in the wild world of punk zines. The first third of the film is pure joy, as Tan narrates the hilarious, absurd, and rage-fueled output of her teenage years, bored and frustrated by her conservative family and country. Tan, Ng and Siddique are perfect heroines, alienated by the world they live in, anxious to express themselves and see the world. Their creative ambition brings them to a filmmaking class taught by the enigmatic Georges Cardona, with whom the precocious Tan bonds, eager for the legitimizing force of an older man’s friendship. Eventually, when Tan writes a surrealist road movie inspired by a road trip taken with Cardona across the United States one summer, he decides to be its champion and direct it. Because of our expectations in 2018 about what happens between an older man and a young women with cinematic aspirations, one does spend a beat or two of Shirkers waiting for an abuse plotline to rear its head. It does, but not at all in the expected form. After shooting wraps and the girls go back to school in Los Angeles, New York, and England, Cardona, who was supposed to assemble a cut, goes MIA, the footage nowhere to be found. The theft of Shirkers is not a physical violation, but it’s an intellectual one, and an emotional one that permanently damages the friendship between Tan, Ng, and Siddique. As a heartbroken Tan sets aside her screenwriting dreams and travels through adulthood, the theft becomes a wound that somehow won’t stop bleeding, even if it doesn’t necessarily hurt anymore. The rest of the film is a kind of accidental detective story that takes Tan from L.A. to Louisiana and back home to Singapore, trying to figure out who Georges Cardona was and what would possibly motivate him to literally steal the dreams of a trio of teenage girls, and in so sadistic a fashion. Tan composes her surreal story of creativity and loss with the kind of boundless wriggliness one imagines her original film might have been imbued with. Images of young Tan in the film, bespectacled and surly and guileless, are indescribably moving. She wanders through a dreamily color-saturated Singapore, always in the same pink school-uniform top and a camera slung around her neck, shooting an endless ensemble of idiosyncratic supporting characters with a finger-gun. Shirkers is a joy, but it also feels haunted, as if Tan had the unique opportunity to unearth a perfectly preserved clone of her younger, more idealistic self. The fact that the footage from the 1992 Shirkers plays so prominent a role in the 2018 documentary is a bit of a giveaway. But all it really gives away is the fact of the film’s existence — the images Tan and, for better or for worse, Cardona produced feel like a lost, prematurely cut-short beginning of a film movement, brimming over with life in a way that belies the passage of over two decades. Even in its most joyous moments, there’s a melancholy to Shirkers that catches in the back of one’s throat: It sends you wondering at all the wild creativity and genius of young irrepressible women lost to time, held up or buried by the domineering egos of men.

There have always been violent extremists. But when attacks happened under Reagan or Clinton or Bush or Obama, you couldn’t point to insane anti-Semitic conspiracy theories they had recently spread. They didn’t praise neo-Nazis. They didn’t call reporters “enemy of the people” Throughout history, demagogues rarely need to direct the violence. They set the tone – they focus the blame, ridicule, rage and hate -- and leave the violent acts to others. That way, they can always say “it wasn’t me. I don’t have blood on my hands. The culprits are out there.” I’m not afraid of immigrants, minorities, gay or lesbian or transgender people or people whose faith is different from mine.

I’m on a seven day ban for it. The irony has me rolling my eyes into the back of my skull. Thanks for helping spread the word that @jack and Twitter are hypocrites!” There is one party that wants healthcare: they are Democrats. There is one party who wants gun reform. They are Democrats. There is one party who believes it’s a right to vote. They are Democrats. There is one party who says nothing when our president lies. They are Republicans. BOOM!! The Border Patrol Union that endorsed Trump in 2016, just endorsed 3 major Democrat Senate candidates who Trump has said are weak on border security: Claire McCaskill, Jon Tester and Heidi Heitkamp! The only way Republicans could unify the country, is if they remove Trump from office. The difference is this: in 1942 when they came my family to march us out of our home at gunpoint, almost no one stood up for us. Today, when something happens to any of us—Jew, trans, Muslim, migrant—many, many rise up. We can learn. We have learned. We must keep learning. Now the Trumpists are passing around a photo of an Auschwitz guard and saying it's George Soros. Hundreds (or more) have reported the tweet, which is libelous, and Twitter has done *nothing*.

(Alex Gangitano/ CQ Roll Call) TUCSON, Ariz. — Former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick served three terms representing Arizona’s largely rural 1st District. She’s seeking a comeback this year from a new seat, the neighboring 2nd, anchored here in the state’s second largest city. But she finds not much has changed. “The issues are the same,” she said Saturday at the Pima County Democratic Party headquarters. “People are just really concerned about protecting social security and medicare, about keeping their health care. Students are really concerned about getting good paying jobs to pay off their student loans.” Former Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is running in Arizona’s 2nd District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) The National Republican Congressional Committee will halt television ad spending in Arizona’s 2nd District days after the party’s candidate stumbled during a debate.

Despite a quarter of the women in the House Republican Conference not running for re-election, the head of the House GOP’s campaign arm said he is “very confident” the party can increase its female members in the chamber next year. But looking at the number of female GOP lawmakers leaving the House and how few Republican women won nominations in open seats this year, just breaking even might be hard for House Republicans. Rep.

With one notable exception, it was mostly a good night for front-runners. Here are our four takeaways: Former Arizona Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick won her primary on Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has won the Democratic primary in Arizona’s 2nd District, one of the top pickup opportunities for Democrats this fall. Kirkpatrick, who previously represented the neighboring 1st District, had the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But she still faced a bruising primary fight thanks to attacks from physician and former state Rep. Matt Heinz, the 2016 nominee. Heinz charged that Kirkpatrick was a carpetbagger who was not liberal enough on issues such as gun control. Students march to the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue to call on Congress to act on gun violence prevention during a national walkout on April 20 to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Gun control has been a third rail of Democratic campaigns, but a new poll suggests that Democratic candidates should embrace a bolder approach to restrictions on guns, even in general elections. Up to this point, Democrats have been decidedly defensive on guns. The most famous instances of Democratic candidates using guns in television ads include West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III shooting the so-called cap-and-trade bill, former Georgia Rep. John Barrow talking about his granddaddy’s pistol and Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander assembling a rifle blindfolded. The ads were meant to reassure voters that Democrats didn’t want to take away their guns. Democratic candidates are continuing to talk about gun violence ahead of their primaries. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) A gun control activist won her Democratic primary in Georgia on Tuesday, and she’s not the only Democrat talking about gun violence on the campaign trail even though the issue has largely faded from the headlines. Lucy McBath, a spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety, won a runoff to take on GOP Rep. Karen Handel in the suburban Atlanta-based 6th District. And Democratic candidates in at least three different districts have spent their campaign funds on television ads focused on gun violence, bringing the issue to the forefront ahead of their primaries next month. Former Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is seeking a comeback from Arizona’s 2nd District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Former Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick does live in Tucson, a judge ruled Tuesday in a lawsuit challenging her residency in the 2nd District. The lawsuit, financed by one of her Democratic primary opponents, had attempted to remove her from the primary ballot. Former state Rep. Matt Heinz, the losing 2016 Democratic nominee for the seat, helped fund the lawsuit that alleged Kirkpatrick falsely claimed in campaign documents that she lived in Tucson. Candidates are not required to live in the districts they are running in, but the plaintiffs alleged Kirkpatrick violated state law that required candidates to accurately reflect their residency on nominating papers. Democrat Matt Heinz is covering the legal costs of a lawsuit against former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick ahead of the 2nd District Democratic primary. (Thomas McKinless/CQ Roll Call file photo). House hopeful Matt Heinz is seeking to knock former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick off the Democratic primary ballot in Arizona’s 2nd District, funding a lawsuit that alleges she falsely claimed on her nominating papers that she lives in Tucson. Heinz and Kirkpatrick are both vying for the Tucson-area open seat in southeastern Arizona that GOP Rep. Martha McSally is vacating to run for Senate.

---split---2.0---split---https://nypost.com/2018/10/28/trump-attacks-pipe-bomb-target-as-stumbling-lunatic/---split---Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Nikki Schwab  October 28, 2018 | 3:16pm | Updated October 28, 2018 | 3:16pm WASHINGTON – President Trump went after Democratic super-donor Tom Steyer – a pipe bomb target – calling him a “crazed” and “stumbling lunatic” Sunday on Twitter. “Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper,” Trump tweeted. “He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon.” “As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!” Trump added. Seeing Trump’s tweet, Steyer shot back. “It is unthinkable that in the midst of the horrible political violence our president would resort to name-calling instead of repairing the damage to the fabric of our country,” Steyer said. For the past year, the California-based Steyer has been running national ads advocating for Trump’s impeachment. On Friday, Steyer responded to the pipe bomb threat by promoting his impeachment petition. Talking to CNN’s Tapper on Sunday, Steyer said he knew there was “no direct link” between Trump and bombing suspect Cesar Sayoc. “But I am absolutely associating and blaming him for creating the atmosphere that exists,” Steyer said of the president. He also called Trump’s response to the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh “appropriate.” “But there’s something much bigger going on here, which is the atmosphere that he’s created, that the Republican Party has created, in terms of political violence,” Steyer said. Amid the bomb scare – in which packages were sent to a number of prominent Democrats and Trump critics, along with CNN – the White House was quick to point out that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was responsible for the Congressional baseball practice shooting, in which Republican lawmakers were targeted and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was wounded. Steyer suggested this was a “false equivalence.” “I would say there has been bad behavior on both sides, but you can’t find prominent Democrats, elected officials who refuse to condemn it. You don’t find prominent Democrats who are leading chants with violent overtones like ‘lock her up,’ ‘CNN sucks,’ all these kinds of attempts to play to people’s strongest emotions,” Steyer said. “And I think that everybody on the Democratic side would look at that shooter of Congressman Scalise and absolutely condemn his action, him and anyone associated with him.” “Not that there is perfection on one side and absolute horror on the other, but we’re seeing something that is not at all equivalent,” he added. Tapper also asked Steyer about a tweet dashed off by the House’s No. 2 Republican, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) The tweet whacked Democratic donors George Soros and Michael Bloomberg, who are both Jewish, along with Steyer, whose late father was Jewish too. “That seems to me like a straight-up anti-Semitic move. I think that that is a classic attempt to separate Americans,” Steyer said. Steyer, who Forbes says is worth $1.6 billion, says he’ll keep at it with the Trump impeachment ads, and says support for removing the president is growing. “I’m representing most Americans,” he argued.

---split---2.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMMrFhAswpKiBAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---President Trump has interviewed Office of Management and Budget official Neomi Rao to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. circuit court, Axios has learned. Why this matters: Given the power federal agencies have to affect national policy and law, the judges of the D.C. Circuit can have an extraordinary impact over the direction of the country. Because of this, people often refer to the D.C. Circuit as the second-most powerful court in the United States, behind only the Supreme Court. Behind the scenes: Don McGahn, as one of his last acts, recommended Rao for the job, according to sources cl... More than 100 S&P 500 companies will report quarterly results this week, but Apple and Facebook are the headliners. Why it matters: Tech companies' good results have not been good enough for investors, as we saw with Alphabet and Amazon this week. Apple and Facebook could further drag tech sentiment down, or turn the tide. What to watch Apple, the world's most valuable public company,is expected to report strong results thanks to a boost in the "average selling price" metric from pricier phones, not necessarily more iPhones sold. - Sales of the $750 iPhone XR won't be included in these resu... Congressional Republicans don't seem to have the pharmaceutical industry's back the way they used to — and the way the industry might expect them to, after donating millions of dollars to GOP campaigns, cycle after cycle. The big picture: The Trump administration rolled out a drug-pricing proposal last week that pharma hates — and that, on paper, congressional Republicans should hate, too, Sam Baker and I report. - It would take a bite out of drug companies' bottom lines, and it would do so by piggybacking off ofEuropean countries’ price controls. - But there was barely a peep from Capitol ... Jair Bolsonaro — a far-right candidate whose misogyny, racism and reverence for military dictators has made him one of Latin America's most polarizing figures — has won Brazil's presidency with over 55% of the vote, per the AP. Why it matters: Many viewed Brazil's election as a referendum on crime and corruption, with each of the country's last three presidents facing impeachment votes or imprisonment due to their involvement in bribery scandals. Bolsonaro has been called "Trump of the Tropics," but a more apt comparison would perhaps be President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Both sh... Vulnerable Republican incumbents face an awkward question on health care: "You say in your campaign that you're committed to protecting insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions; what do you make of the fact that the Trump Justice Department is currently arguing in court to strike down the law forcing insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions?" Why this matters: Polls consistently show health care is a top issue for midterm voters. Republicans are already on their heels on this issue — a reversal from the previous eight years of easy campaigning against Obamacar... President Trump is adding an 11th rally to his final six-day blitz leading into the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Trump will be ending his campaign swing, on election eve, in the pivotal Senate state of Missouri, according to a source with direct knowledge of Trump's plans. Why this matters: Trump is going to Trump country within Trump states. Not a single competitive House seat lies within these locations. Alexi McCammond got her hands on fresh details — dates and specific locations — of the Trump political team's schedule ahead of the midterms. The locations and dates we cite here, the big pi... IBM announced Sunday it would acquire Linux specialist Red Hat in a deal valued at $34 billion in cash and debt.

Red Hat, which charges corporate clients for custom-built Linux offerings, fits into that strategy. The move comes as others are also doubling down on Linux, including longtime rival Microsoft which just completed its $7... Never has a conference failed more spectacularly than this year's Future Investment Initiative. The so-called "Davos in the Desert" was meant to position Saudi Arabia as an innovative, dynamic nation with a bright tech-centered future ahead of it. Instead: No one wanted to speak at the conference, and almost no one wanted to even attend. In the slots reserved for high-profile western CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Dara Khosrowshahi, we saw instead executives mostly from Russia and the kingdom itself. - The conference ended up shining a bright light on Saudi Arabia at exactly the time when the wo... This was a week of bombs, shootings — and blame. "72 hours in America: Three hate-filled crimes. Three hate-filled suspects," CNN writes: "Wednesday, a white man with a history of violence shot and killed two African-Americans ... at a Kentucky Kroger store following a failed attempt to barge into a black church." "After mail bombs were being sent to people who'd been criticized by the President, a suspect was arrested ... who had railed against Democrats and minorities with hate-filled messages online." Yesterday morning, "a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire at a Pittsburgh synag... More and more people in the U.S. and worldwide believe brands should take a stand on societal issues, a report from Edelman says. Why it matters: Public stances, from campaign ads to press releases — especially on activist issues — have effects on the public perception of a company, its future sales and even the stock market. People see brands as an important way of expressing themselves and consumers want companies to align with their core beliefs, Felix Richter, data analyst for Statista, writes. In 2018, 64% of people worldwide say a company’s stand on societal issues affects their patro... President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell six times for raising interest rates. Flashback: Nearly one year ago, Trump struck a very different tone when nominating Powell: "If we are to sustain all of this tremendous economic progress, our economy requires sound monetary policy ... That is why we need strong, sound, and steady leadership at the United States Federal Reserve. I have nominated Jay [Powell] to be our next Federal [Reserve] Chairman ... because he will provide exactly that type of leadership." What's changed since then is that the Fed hiked i... PayPal has cut ties with social networking service Gab following news that Pittsburgh gunman Robert Bowers — who killed 11 people at Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday — had a history of using the platform for anti-Semitic speech, reports The Verge. The big picture: Gab was founded in 2016 as a restriction-free alternative to Twitter, a social network that — while claiming "to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people" — has attracted alt-right figures like Milo Yiannapolous and Richard Spencer that have been banned from other social media platforms. The backdrop: ... The 11 people killed at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh ranged from ages 54 to 97, and included brothers and a married couple, authorities said Sunday. The big picture: Gunman Robert Bowers has been arrested and charged on 29 federal counts, and is currently being treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds. Authorities say Bowers had three Glock .357 handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle. During his deadly rampage, Bowers made statements about genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people. The victims' names: - Joyce Feinberg, 75 - Richard Godfried, 65 - Rose Mallinger, 97 - Jerry Rabinowi...

The controversies surrounding the NFL — including Colin Kaepernick's collusion lawsuit against the league as well as the kneeling debate he sparked — have shrouded the Super Bowl in political drama. Why it matters: The Super Bowl was once a coveted event at which brands competed for commercial space and celebrities were anxious to perform. But as the nation's politics become more polarized and Kaepernick remains jobless, the league's biggest game has become a lightning rod for controversy. The details: Celebrities are refusing to be affiliated with the game because of their political stance...

Both the public safety director and the FBI special agent in charge have described the scene as "horrific" and "one of the worst I've seen." Six people were injured, including 4 officers. Don Yealy of University of Pittsburgh Department of Emergency Medicine confirmed there were no children among the deceased and described two civilian victims as a 61-year-old female with extremity wounds, and a 70-year-old male with critical gun shot... New proposed regulations, authorized by President Trump's budget deal from earlier this year, would open the door for Medicare Advantage companies to cover telehealth services for all enrollees starting in 2020. The bottom line: This rule would give a leg up to the MA program, which is managed by the health insurance industry, since traditional Medicare strictly limits coverage of telehealth. The Congressional Budget Office has worried that telehealth visits will serve as add-on services to in-person clinic visits instead of acting as replacements, thus driving up Medicare spending. Before boarding Air Force One on his way to the Future Farmers of America convention, President Trump responded to the Pittsburgh shooting saying the U.S. should "stiffen up" death penalty laws and people who commit such crimes should "pay the ultimate price."

Few changes in modern life will hit in more radical ways than how we get around. Already, people are abandoning cars for ride-hailing and tooling around on electric scooters. Computer-assisted driving is giving way to prototype autonomous vehicles that share the road in some cities with pedestrians, bicyclists and traditional vehicles. The big picture: The vision is that driverless cars will chauffeur you anywhere while you relax, work or socialize. The reality is that while 99% of routine driving skills have been relatively easy for robots to achieve, the last 1% haven't — and those are cr...

It seems unlikely that efforts to soften a possible dismissal after the Nov. 6 midterm election would find sympathy in the White House, where President Donald Trump's rage remains unabated over the attorney general's recusal from the Russia investigation. A hand-picked successor could theor... (AP) Just days after major Democratic donor Tom Steyer received a pipe bomb in the mail, President Donald Trump sent out a tweet on Sunday calling him a crazed lunatic. "Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper,” the president wrote. "He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!" Steyer was one of numerous high-profile Democrats to receive a pipe bomb in the mail last week, according to The Hill. Trum...

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., saying the post was “an anti-Semitic move.” In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the hedge fund manager who’s leading a campaign to impeach President Donald Trump, was questioned about the tweet, which suggested Steyer, George Soros and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — all of whom are Jewish — are trying to buy the 2018 elections.

For years, the political establishment had dismissed the 63-year-old former paratrooper as a clown.

Bill Nelson and his challenger, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, is rife with national political significance, but it is being shaped by intensely local forces. 69 Republicans and Democrats are sparring on the campaign trail over who gets credit and blame for the economy.

Alaska isn’t normally much on the national political radar, but by the end of Nov. 6 it could hold some notable distinctions. The best way for Republicans to earn the votes of undecided voters is to clearly articulate how they would fix our broken health- care system. Elite bubble dwellers continue to fall hard for the illusion that the public trusts them to decide what matters most. Politicians in both parties need to clean up their own side of the street. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting shows anti-Semitism is a serious problem in America that must not be ignored. In the last few weeks, health officials in a number of states have reported deaths attributable to flu. The global financial crisis that hit 10 years ago has remarkable similarities to a much earlier crisis that most people today have never heard of – in 1287 in England. It all started with words from my doctor that I never expected to hear. President Trump and Republicans drew harsh media criticism this past week linking them to the actions of the person who mailed homemade bombs to former President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Trump critics. The shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue where I prayed for years continues the long history of anti-Semitism. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the pipe bomb mailings are rooted in hatred.

My entire adult life, I’ve been enamored with house and home and making beautiful things. After the Pittsburgh synagogue attack we must fight anti-Semitism and improve security measures.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/opinion/trump-toxicity-pittsburgh-violence.html---split---Advertisement Supported by Trump has flirted with the deepest racists and Nazis and it has not gone unnoticed, least of all by them. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Our national dialogue about diversity and inclusion, about acceptance and egalitarianism, is poisoned, and Donald Trump is holding a rather large pouch of poison. Last week, we saw the arrest of a Trump supporter who sent pipe bombs through the mail to people who were frequent rhetorical targets of the president, many of them prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. Then on Saturday came a mass shooting at a Jewish synagogue by a rabid anti-Semite. As NBC reported: “The shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh — in which the death toll now stands at 11 — is believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the U.S., the Anti-Defamation League said.” According to CNN, the shooter, Robert Bowers, was a man who claimed on the social media app Gab, a nest of white nationalists and the ‘alt-right,’ that Jews were behind the migrant caravans. NBC News put it this way: “Bowers frequently posted about the ‘migrant caravan,’ a group of several thousand refugees walking to the U.S.-Mexico border from Honduras to seek asylum. Preventing refugees in the caravan from entering the U.S. has been a major talking point among both right-wing commentators and President Donald Trump, who has spoken about it in recent pre-midterm election stump speeches.” There is no way to separate Trump from the fulminating against the caravans. And yet, even Trump appears to have been too mild a racist and “nationalist” for the synagogue shooter. As CNN notes, “roughly four hours before the shooting, Bowers commented in a post that he did not vote for Trump.” He once posted “Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist,” and he has posted that Trump is surrounded by too many Jewish people. Therein lies the uneasy alliance: The white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right are energized by Trump’s election, and yet many find his white power positioning falls short of their own. That doesn’t mean that Trump doesn’t court their support and defend their actions. After the alt-right staged its deadly march in Charlottesville, in which throngs of marchers with torches chanted “Jews will not replace us,” Trump insisted that there had been “very fine people on both sides” of the protest. When Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who helped organize the Charlottesville rally, spoke to reporters last year, Business Insider reported: “Asked whether he considers Trump an ally, Spencer replied that while he didn’t think of Trump as ‘alt-right,’ he considers the president to be ‘the first true authentic nationalist in my lifetime.’ ” As The Atlantic has reported, Spencer “gained international notoriety just after the 2016 election for giving a speech in Washington, D.C., in which he declared ‘Hail Trump!,’ prompting Nazi salutes from his audience.” In an interview with Vice, Christopher Cantwell, who was also involved in the Charlottesville march, had this exchange with the interviewer over the issue of white violence: Cantwell: I’m here to spread ideas, talk in the hopes that somebody more capable will come along and do that, somebody like Donald Trump who does not give his daughter to a Jew. Interviewer: So Donald Trump, but like, more racist? Cantwell: A lot more racist than Donald Trump. I don’t think that you could feel about race the way I do and watch that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl.” That of course was a reference to Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner. So these folks are emboldened by Trump, but now that they have an inch, they want a mile. Still there is clearly something happening on the ground that is undeniable. As The New York Times reported on Saturday: “According to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued earlier this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979.” 2017, of course, was the first year of the Trump administration. As always, this cautionary note must be included: Homicidal maniacs are responsible for their own actions. It is almost impossible in most cases to attach the words of one person to the deeds of another. However, it must also be said that Trump has produced a toxic environment of intolerance in this country that is deep and wide. He has flirted with the deepest racists and Nazis and it has not gone unnoticed, least of all by them. Last week at a debate, Florida’s Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum said of his Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis: “I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist.” I believe that the same could be said of Trump, although he engages in his own strain of racism.

President Donald Trump refuted reports on Thursday that – despite warnings from the intelligence community – his continued use of a personal cell phone has enabled foreign spies to listen. Yet leading experts in the security and the intel arena concurred that such breaches are highly plausible and far more wide-reaching than what meets the eye, or the ear. The vice president, while campaigning for Senate candidate Martha McSally in Arizona, says the Honduran president has told him the migrant caravan is being organized and funded by left-wing activists. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her boss on Sunday amid rising accusations that President Trump’s fiery rhetoric inspired Cesar Sayoc to allegedly sent mail bombs to a number of prominent Democrats. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said Sunday that while President Trump needs to more clear and less caustic in his language, he doesn’t believe there is any connection between the president’s rhetoric and Saturday’s mass shooting in Pittsburgh. Does he lie, and does it matter? He hits 'hateful' press over explosive packages. In the wake of the tragic mass shooting at synagogue in his city that left 11 people dead and six others wounded, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto balked at President Trump’s statement that the massacre could have been prevented if the house of worship had employed an armed guard. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen called the mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday “a pure act of evil” and noted that DHS officials had previously visited the house of worship to give advice to its staff on a possible active shooter scenario. Exclusive: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen weighs in on the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the arrest of a Florida man accused of sending package bombs to prominent Democrats and efforts to derail the migrant caravan from Central America.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/pittsburgh-mayor-trump-armed-guards-are-not-answer-n925341---split---WASHINGTON — Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said Sunday that he disagrees with President Donald Trump's call for more armed guards at places of worship in order to prevent shootings like the one that claimed the lives of 11 congregants at a synagogue in the city on Saturday. Instead, Peduto told NBC's "Meet the Press," he believes that gun-control measures would go further to help stop these shootings. "I belong to an organization, a bipartisan organization, called Mayors Against Illegal Guns," Peduto said. "I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or schools filled with armed guards." He added: "We should try to stop irrational behavior from happening at the forefront. And not try to create laws around irrational behavior to continue." Mayors Against Illegal Guns is a part of Everytown for Our Safety, a group started by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It calls for gun-control policies including mandating background checks for all gun sales and stiffening penalties for gun sellers who intentionally break the law. Peduto spoke near the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where 11 congregants were killed when a gunman opened fire during the Saturday morning prayer service. Six others were wounded in the attack, including multiple police officers who responded to the scene. Robert Bowers, the Pennsylvania man arrested at the scene, has been charged with 29 federal counts including murder and hate crimes. He also faces 36 charges from Pennsylvania that include homicide and ethnic intimidation.His social media profiles show rampant posts threatening Jews and sharing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump decried the "evil" of anti-Semitism and reiterated his support for the death penalty. "It is a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world. And something has to be done," Trump said to reporters Saturday as he boarded Air Force One before a campaign event in Indiana. The president went on to argue that the synagogue could have been better equipped to respond to the shooting if it had armed guards posted regularly inside. "This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately," he said. "Isn't it a shame that we even have to think of that inside of a temple, or inside of a church, but certainly, the results might have been far better." Appearing on "Meet the Press" Sunday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, lamented the rise of anti-Semitism, which his organization has been tracking well before Saturday's shooting. Greenblatt said that in 2017, "we saw a 57 percent surge of acts of harassment, vandalism and violence directed at the Jewish community across the country. It was the single-largest spike we've ever seen," he said. "We are living in a moment where anti-Semitism is almost becoming normalized, and that should shock and move all of us to act." CORRECTION (Oct. 28, 2018, 12:44 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated Jonathan Greenblatt’s title. He is the chief executive officer of the ADL, not the chief operating officer.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-gab-tree-of-life/---split---11 people were killed and six others—including four police officers—injured Saturday when a gunman opened fire during a baby-naming ceremony at the Tree of Life Congregation, a Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The shooter, Robert Bowers, 46, surrendered to the police and was taken to the hospital, a local councilwoman told the The New York Times. Bowers—who has been linked to an account on the social media site Gab that shared anti-Semitic messages—is expected to face hate crime charges. The Anti-Defamation league called the shooting "likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States." Gab, a relatively small social network that claims to "defend individual liberty and free expression online" has fewer restrictions on what users can post than platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Its relative lawlessness has made it a gathering spot for white supremacists and other members of the extreme alt-right. The network released a statement following Saturday's shooting identifying an account believed to have belonged to Bowers, the Synagogue shooter. "The account was verified and matched the name of the alleged shooter’s name, which was mentioned on police scanners," the statement reads. "This person also had accounts on other social networks." Gab says it took down Bowers account and contacted the FBI, according to the post. Paypal banned Gab from its payment platform after Saturday's shooting. This is the second attack this week in which the perpetrator has been linked to social media accounts that shared online conspiracy theories. Cesar Sayoc, 56, who was arrested earlier this week in connection with 13 explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, is believed to have used sites like Twitter to share ultra-right-wing conspiracy theories about many of the people he targeted. That includes George Soros, a prominent Jewish philanthropist who is often the target of right-wing conspiracy theories, which have been repeatedly echoed by President Trump. The first device discovered Monday was located at Soros' home. It may never be entirely clear why Sayoc and Bowers chose to carry out violent attacks. But their social media activity is part of a broader increase in anti-Semitism online. Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia's Tow Center For Digital Journalism, has recently found a high volume of anti-Semitic content on Instagram, under hashtags like "#soros". In advance of the midterm elections, far-right extremists have used anti-Semitism as a talking point on social media, according to a report released Friday from the Anti-Defamation league, a Jewish civil-rights group that tracks bigotry and hate crimes. The ADL's researchers interviewed five Jewish Americans who are involved in politics and analyzed more than 7.5 million Tweets, sent between August 31 to September 17 of this year. In that time, they found that amount of anti-Semitic language had increased. "The online public sphere—now a primary arena for communication about American politics—has become progressively inhospitable for Jewish Americans," the researchers wrote. They also concluded that the majority of anti-Semitic messages posted to Twitter came from real individuals, not bots. Anti-Jewish sentiment is also on the rise in seedier online locales, including Gab and the message board 4Chan, both of which are already known to house hate speech and far-right conspiracy theories. The use of term "jew" and a slur for Jewish people dramatically increased on Gab and 4chan's politically incorrect message board following political events like the 2016 presidential election, President Trump's inauguration, and the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to a study conducted by the non-profit Network Contagion Research Institute that has yet to be peer-reviewed. Anti-Semitism is also on the rise in the real world too. Instances of anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism, and assault increased 57 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to an Anti-Defamation League report released earlier this year. It's the largest single-year jump the ADL has recorded since it began collecting data in the 1970s. In its most recently released survey, the FBI found that was an almost 5 percent rise in hate crimes in 2016—and, that of the roughly 20 percent of hate crimes that were religiously motivated, more than half were targeted against Jews. From 2014 to 2015, the FBI recorded a 10 percent rise in hate crimes. It's impossible, at this point, to directly correlate Sayoc and Bowers' online postings to their subsequent violent attacks—but taken in tandem, the combination is troubling. Digital communities provide a fertile breeding ground for hate speech to fester and organize. It wouldn't be the first time these online ecosystems spilled that hate into real world violence.

President Trump had strong words on the subject of religious persecution following Saturday’s deadly shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling the attack an “assault on humanity.” Speaking at a campaign rally for Illinois Rep. Mike Bost, Trump initially addressed the shooting inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania’s predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood. At least 11 people were killed when a gunman entered and opened fire. “This evil, anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It is an assault on humanity,” the president said, reiterating remarks he'd made about the episode earlier in the day. “It must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its ugly head. We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate.” “Those seeking their destruction, we will seek their destruction.” PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE PROVOKES OUTRAGE, ANGER AND CALLS TO ACTION Trump also doubled down on earlier calls to invoke the death penalty. “We must draw a line in the sand and say very strongly, never again.” Trump said he'd weighed the idea of canceling the rally and an earlier event in Indiana in light of the “horrible” shooting. “We can’t allow people like this to become important,” he said. Just before taking the stage, Trump again shared his condolences for what he called “the mass murder of Jewish Americans.” “We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries...,” his tweet read. Four officers were among the injured. Trump is on a rally blitz, hoping to bolster Republicans in Nov. 6 midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress.

(Oct. 28) AP Two people support each other in front of flowers at a makeshift memorial at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) PITTSBURGH — Marcy Pepper was at home when she heard the gunshots. Her dogs started barking and he husband told her to stay inside. “There’s a shooter in Squirrel Hill? What are you talking about?” daughter Molly Bedo found herself asking. The mom and daughter were members Tree of Life synagogue up until this year and, like many others in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, they were horrified when they heard news that a gunman killed 11 worshippers as he hurled anti-Semitic hatred during the rampage. 'A line in the sand': Pittsburgh synagogue rampage spotlights rising anti-Semitism in America 'This is heartbreaking': A 97-year-old, an elderly wife and husband: These are the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre “How do you walk in there again and walk by that spot,” Pepper wondered of the survivors’ of Saturday’s massacre. Police officers were at her door throughout Saturday as her family waited for the news from the scene. Like many in Squirrel Hill, Pepper called the neighborhood “tight knit.” She knew Cecil Rosenthal, a longtime Tree of Life member who died in the shooting, as well as his brother David, who was also killed. Pepper and Cecil Rosenthal went to grade school together, and she said she tried to defend him from bullies. “I’m heart sick about it,” she said. Rosenthal was known for and loved to greet people at the door of Tree of Life, she said. “He was so connected, with being happy and promoting happiness,” Pepper added. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. That welcoming of spirit extended throughout Tree of Life, Pepper and Bedo said. Bedo described the synagogue as a “safe haven,” but “now it feels stripped away from you.” Bedo said she stayed in Squirrel Hill, raising her own family, because of a feeling of security and community in the area. She remembers being dragged to Saturday services as a child with her grandfather, who would sometimes invite strangers over for dinner after meeting them at the synagogue or around the neighborhood. Her husband also grew up in Squirrel Hill. 'Screw your optics': Who is Robert Bowers? Accused Pittsburgh synagogue shooter left anti-semitic trail But now, Bedo said she’ll have to decide whether she’ll want to send her kids to a Jewish school, feeling a rise of hate throughout the country. “You are now a target,” she said, showing her tattoo of the Star of David on the back of her neck. “You leave this neighborhood – it’s not how the world really is. Your bubble is broken.” “It’s not going to go away when you pull the window shade down,” Pepper added. But within the neighborhood, Bedo seemed more optimistic. “The only thing you’ll see out of this – the doors to people’s homes will open up to more others.” Around the Squirrel Hill on Sunday, many went about their days as normal. Families walked around with their dogs. Friends greeted each other outside their homes. Hanna and Michael Steiner were heading to a local farmers market after a meeting at the Jewish Community Center. The building that housed the center was secured throughout the day, with police officers standing outside. “These are places we go to pray,” Michael Steiner said, teary-eyed. “This isn’t a place where I think of weapons.” He and his wife are members of a different local synagogue, and he said he can’t even begin to let the question of “what-if” enter his mind. The couple said it was hard to wrap their head around the hatred that drove the attack. And like others, they said a sense of fear is also setting in. “Everyone feels the threat and danger,” Hanna Steiner said. Her husband added, “We’re still undergoing a trauma.” A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Robert Bowers, the suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at the synagogue, expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and told officers afterward that Jews were committing genocide and he wanted them all to die, according to charging documents made public Sunday. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH – Tributes rolled in Sunday to the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre as authorities worked to piece together the background and movements of the suspected gunman, who authorities said expressed hatred of Jews as he opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons and later told police, "All these Jews need to die." Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, authorities said in state and federal affidavits made public on Sunday. Six people were injured in the attack, including four officers. Officials released the names of all 11 of the dead, all of them middle-aged or elderly. The victims included intellectually disabled brothers and a husband and wife. The youngest was 54 and the oldest was 97. "The loss is incalculable," said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. Mayor Bill Peduto called it the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." Bowers shot his victims with an AR-15 — the weapon used in many of the nation's mass shootings — and three handguns, all of which he owned legally and had a license to carry, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation, and spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity. Little else was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. It appears he acted alone, authorities said. His neighbor, Chris Hall, said he never heard or saw anything to indicate that Bowers harbored anti-Semitic views or posed a threat. Bowers kept to himself, he said. "The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed," Hall said. "I wish I knew what was going on inside his head. Maybe something could have been done. I don't know." The victims included Melvin Wax, a retired accountant in his late 80s who was always one of the first to arrive at synagogue and among the last to leave. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other," said Myron Snider, a fellow member of New Light Congregation, which rented space in the basement of Tree of Life. "Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." The toll also included professors, dentists and physicians. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center tweeted it mourned the loss of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, "one of the kindest physicians and human beings in our community." Two other victims, Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his younger brother David Rosenthal, 54, were intellectually disabled and lived together in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, near the synagogue where they were killed. "Cecil's laugh was infectious. David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable," said Chris Schopf, vice president of residential supports for ACHIEVA, which helped the brothers live independently. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Vigils were planned in Pittsburgh, Washington and elsewhere, while the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns observed a moment of silence at Heinz Field on Sunday. Bowers apparently posted an anti-Semitic message on a social media account linked to him just a few minutes before he opened fire during Sabbath services on Saturday morning. After the attack, he told an officer, "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit . The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of the city's Jewish community. The Jewish community is "an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh, and so this was an attack upon our neighbors and upon our friends," said Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania. Retired Tree of Life Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who knew nearly all of the victims, said Bowers penetrated all three areas of the synagogue where the worshippers were gathered. The synagogue pays police officers to provide security on high holidays, but not at other times, he said. "When that was over, there's virtually no security," he said. "We were lax in our vigilance." Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not received any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But security was a concern, he said, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. Cohen said leaders of New Light Congregation — which rents space at Tree of Life — had participated in active-shooting drills, "and I think that's what ultimately saved the people who were saved." Cohen, who was not at the synagogue on Saturday, said the congregation — which lost three of its members in the rampage — meets in the basement of the building, which is partially protected by a steel door. The rabbi, Jonathan Perlman, shepherded some of the congregants behind the door "and actually saved them," Cohen said. Bowers was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in what the leader of the Anti-Defamation League called the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. He was also charged in a 29-count federal criminal complaint that included counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death — a federal hate crime — and using a firearm to commit murder. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the charges could merit a death sentence. Bowers, who underwent surgery and remained hospitalized, is scheduled for a court appearance Monday. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf. A message left with the federal public defender's office in Pittsburgh wasn't immediately returned. Of the six survivors, five remained in the hospital Sunday, and two were listed in critical condition. The nation's latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh in St. Peter's Square. "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence," he said. He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, and Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-bowers-synagogue-shooter-hate-crime_us_5bd4892be4b0a8f17ef84019---split---The man accused of committing a deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday was an avowed anti-Semite who police say announced his presence by shouting “All Jews must die!” before he opened fire. Robert Bowers allegedly shot and killed at least 10 people and wounded others at the Tree of Life Congregation, which was full of people at the time. Police said he entered the building, made the anti-Semitic declaration, opened fire, and then barricaded himself inside before he was taken into custody. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice plans to file federal hate crime charges against Bowers, as well as “other criminal charges.” “The Department of Justice will continue to support our state and local partners and we will continue to bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people,” Sessions said in a Saturday afternoon statement. While a motive hasn’t been made official, it’s clear from Bowers’ online persona that he was a racist who held a deep hatred for Jewish people. He was active on Gab, a social media platform popular among neo-Nazis, and regularly posted racist and anti-Jewish sentiments. His biography on the site said: “jews are the children of satan.” Less than two hours before the shooting, he railed against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in increasingly desperate posts, saying that he’d had enough of the “hostile invaders” and was “going in.” “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he wrote. His profile was taken down shortly after 11:30 a.m. But archives of his activity on the platform showed that he was an anti-Semite who was critical of President Trump for not being a true “nationalist,” and openly discussed the QAnon conspiracy theory, a dangerous, all-encompassing conspiracy web that started online and has since wormed its way into real life. He regularly reposted neo-Nazi content and openly lambasted diversity. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he wrote on Thursday. “#Qanon is here to get patriots that were against martial law in the 90′s to be the ones begging for it now to drain muh swamp.” He had also commented on the capture of Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested in Florida on Friday after allegedly sending more than a dozen explosive devices to various high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros. He poked fun at Sayoc’s garish van, which was covered in pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers, as well as conspiracy theories and memes. Gab released a statement after the shooting, saying that the site doesn’t allow for calls to violence: “Gab.com’s policy on terrorism and violence have always been very clear: we a have zero tolerance policy for it. Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. This has always been our policy. We are saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh and are keeping the families and friends of all victims in our thoughts and prayers.” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said authorities were still trying to learn the “extent of this anti-Semitic attack.” “We are devastated,” he wrote on Twitter. “Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community.” This story has been updated with a statement from Jeff Sessions.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ame-church-synagogue-shooting_us_5bd5e907e4b0a8f17ef8d6e5---split---The pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine worshippers were gunned down in 2015, condemned President Donald Trump’s response to the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday. “Words do matter,” the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning told his congregants during an emotional sermon on Sunday. “The words that come out of your mouth can do much harm or much good. The choice is indeed yours.” Manning criticized Trump for claiming “armed guards” likely could have prevented a gunman’s attack on the Tree of Life Congregation, which left at least 11 people dead and several others wounded. He contrasted Trump’s remarks to former President Barack Obama’s response to the 2015 mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church (commonly referred to as Mother Emanuel). “We were comforted by President Barack Obama, who came and sang ‘Amazing Grace,’” Manning said. “He began to use the eloquence of his speech to provide comfort at a time in which we all needed much comfort.” But Manning said he was baffled Saturday as he watched Trump’s respond to the shooting in Pittsburgh, one of the worst anti-Semitic attacks in U.S. history. “I was becoming more outraged and outraged,” Manning said, “because as opposed to saying, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and violence has no place in the United States, and hateful speech will no longer be tolerated,’ there was a meltdown on his part, saying maybe just maybe if they were armed we wouldn’t have had this problem. Words do matter.” Manning called on Trump to use his words to heal people ― and also encouraged members of his church to get out and vote if they want to see change. “The tongue has the power of life and death,” Manning said. “Sometimes we don’t think that other people are paying attention, but they are indeed paying attention. They hear exactly what you’re saying and sometimes people unfortunately utter certain thoughtless phrases that instead of lifting up a certain people, they begin to rally around a dog whistle.” Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was in office during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, also said a few words during Sunday’s service at Mother Emanuel. “I suppose that Mother Emanuel might be feeling a special weight this morning after the tragedy and the violence in Pittsburgh yesterday, and how it must bring back the tragedy and violence in this community and in this sacred place,” Patrick said. He continued: “There’s been so much poison, so much poison, so much hate ... but I also know what you know ― that we don’t have to sow just hate, that we can also sow grace. ... I know that we can sow better seeds in our politics.”

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Former FBI special agent Maureen O’Connell weighs in. Like millions of people around the world, I was horrified when I first heard about the mass shooting Saturday at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that resulted in the deaths of 11 people and left six wounded. Officials said Robert Bowers was arrested and charged with 29 criminal counts in connection with the mass killing. The attack on the synagogue came a day after authorities arrested Cesar Sayoc in connection with the mailing of pipe bombs to former and current Democratic officials – including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Eric Holder and two U.S. senators – along with other prominent critics of President Trump, plus CNN. Thankfully, the bombs did not go off and no one was hurt. The arguments today we now hear from both the right and the left are the same ones we hear after every mass shooting. Many people on the left call for stricter gun control, including banning weapons such as the AR-15-style assault rifle used in the Pittsburgh shooting. (As an aside, I agree with banning the AR-15, but that is for a different column). Many people on the right support the position of President Trump, who said Saturday: "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him,” referring to the gunman. Our minds are filled with hatred – whether it be from what we watch on television, listen to on radio and in podcasts, or read in news stories and opinion pieces. Many conservatives also want teachers to carry firearms and see more armed people in places of worship and elsewhere to defend against criminals. But the arguments about guns don’t address what is behind all of these attacks: hate. Sayoc, the alleged pipe bomber, reportedly hated people who spoke out against President Trump. His lawyer said that Sayoc looked to the president as a father figure. His van was plastered with pictures of targets on faces of people who have criticized the president. The social media accounts of Bowers reportedly suggested he hated Jews, immigrants, refugees, politicians and “invaders.” In the past, when we have suffered attacks, or feel like we are in danger of being attacked, President Trump and many of his supporters have sought to impose bans on people entering the U.S. Ban all Muslims, ban Syrian refugees, ban people coming from Central America in the caravan. The list goes on. We talk a lot about banning and I believe it stems not only from fear, but from our hatred of those we perceive to be different from ourselves, or even as evil. There are Americans who even attend rallies where hate of certain groups is applauded. Our minds are filled with hatred – whether it be from what we watch on television, listen to on radio and in podcasts, or read in news stories and opinion pieces. Our talking heads, journalists, talk show hosts, politicians and even our president spew hate. This constant rhetoric of hatred, of exclusion and of banning is circulated in our minds. So we can ban guns, we can ban people who are a certain religion or come from a certain country. But if we don’t address the root of the anger, I fear the attacks will continue – whether with a knife, a gun or a bomb. We need to take a deep look in the mirror, America. We need to stop screaming about bans, which alone will not fix this problem we have as a very angry and divided and, dare I say, hateful nation. We need to change. The change begins within each of us. We need to stop hating each other. If only we could ban that. We need to ban hate.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Insight from Ned Ryun, former writer for President George W. Bush. President Trump derided rival billionaire Tom Steyer as a "wacky" and "crazed & stumbling lunatic" on Sunday, after Steyer -- who was one of the prominent liberals to receive a threatening suspicious package last week -- said he "absolutely was blaming" Trump for creating an atmosphere in which "anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up." Steyer fired back quickly, writing that Trump's comment was "unthinkable ... in the midst of the horrible political violence." The Twitter conflagration erupted after Steyer's wide-ranging interview with CNN's "State of the Union," in which the hedge fund manager called Trump "corrupt," and accused him of "the most abject dereliction of duty in the history of the country" by "willingly putting Americans in harm's way" because he has dismissed a major United Nations report on global climate change. Tom Steyer, seen here, said: "If you look across the political scene, what you see is routine, systematic lawlessness. ... We see it in a president who has been breaking the law systematically." (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Steyer not only appeared to implicate the president's rhetoric in the suspected explosive devices allegedly mailed by Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc to top liberal figures, including Steyer, but also in the deadly mass shooting by gunman Robert Gregory Bowers at a synagogue on Saturday. Bowers regularly posted anti-Trump and anti-Semitic comments on social media. "I think his response to the tragedy [Saturday] was appropriate, but there's something much bigger than that going on here, which is the atmosphere that he's created -- and that the Republican Party has created -- in terms of political violence," Steyer said. "If you look across the political scene, what you see is routine, systematic lawlessness. ... We see it in a president who has been breaking the law systematically, as a candidate, as a businessman, and as a president." Steyer charged that Trump wants to undermine "the laws of the United States" and conduct an "attack on the rule of law," although he stopped short of saying Trump was directly responsible for any physical acts of violence. Tapper pointed out that last year, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was nearly killed when a left-wing gunman shot him and two others with a rifle at a GOP congressional baseball practice. And earlier this month, a Utah man was arrested and accused of attempting to send a crude form of the poison ricin to Trump and to the Pentagon. "I would say there has been bad behavior on both sides," Steyer conceded, although he went on to characterize Tapper's remarks as a "false equivalence" because, he said, Republicans behaved significantly worse. "You can't find prominent Democrats who are leading chants with violent overtones. ... all the kinds of attempts to play to people's strongest emotions." ETHICS COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST DEMOCRATIC REP. MAXINE WATERS AFTER SHE ENCOURAGES SUPPORTERS TO 'PUSH' ON REPUBLICANS IN PUBLIC TOP DEMOCRATIC SEN. SLAMS CLINTON'S CALL TO ABANDON CIVILITY WITH GOP: 'RIDICULOUS' Steyer also told host Jake Tapper it was a "straight-up anti-Semitic move" for Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to post a since-deleted warning that prominent liberal donors, including Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, and George Soros, were attempting to "buy" the 2018 elections. (Bloomberg and Soros are Jewish, and Steyer's late father was Jewish.) McCarthy deleted the tweet before Saturday's shooting, and his spokesman has said the congressman "has and will always condemn in the strongest possible way violence or any acts of attempted violence." The tweet initially attracted criticism because it was posted after an apparent explosive device was found at Soros' suburban New York compound. But Steyer said the post was a "classic attempt to separate Americans" and constitutes "political violence," even though Steyer added it would be inappropriate to speculate on what was going through McCarthy's mind. RAND PAUL WARNS OF ASSASSINATION PERIL IN D.C.: 'I WORRY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED' The wealthy philanthropist has spent tens of millions of dollars on advertisements calling for Trump's impeachment and removal. Hours after the shooting on Saturday, he wrote on Twitter, "Innocent people are dead and the atmosphere is poisonous. We need a change from the top down." Trump unloaded on Steyer after the interview aired, offering not only a nickname for him, but also a quick assessment of his prospective chances in the upcoming Democratic presidential primary. "Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper," Trump wrote on Twitter. "He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!" DEMS POISED TO MAKE HISTORIC IMPEACHMENT PUSH AFTER MIDTERMS Steyer concluded his interview with Tapper by promising to "keep going" in his effort to impeach and remove Trump from office. "I think it is really important, if we're going to have a more positive 21st century as an American century, that we not only oppose what's wrong, but stand up for what's right," Steyer said. "If you actually look at what Americans think, almost 80 percent of registered Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office," he added. "If you ask Americans broadly -- Democrats, Republicans and Independents -- more people are in favor of that than aren't. ... What we have is a movement asking for a different America."

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Democrats need to flip at least 23 seats to take over control of the House of Representatives; insight from Rep. Ben Ray Luján, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep. Steve Stivers, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The chairs of both the Democratic and Republican House campaign arms on Sunday called for unity in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, and said the recent bout of violence should not be politicized in the final days ahead of November’s midterm elections. During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Reps. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, said that elected officials need to work together to unify the country following Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a rash of bomb threats leveled against prominent critics of President Trump. “We should come together as a country," Luján said. "This should not be a political response, but rather a response at how we can further bring us together." Stivers added that both Democrats and Republicans have in recent years been the subject of political violence, citing the recent bomb threats against Democrats and the 2017 shooting that targeted a group of GOP lawmakers during baseball practice. “I want to say that Ben is not my enemy. Democrats are not my enemy. They are my opponents, and while we have different visions for the future of America, different directions, we are all Americans first," Stivers said. "We need to come together and do what’s in the best interest of America," he added. "No matter who wins in 10 days I believe we can come together and make that happen." Along with their appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” the two also showed up on NBC’s “Meet the Press” to push the unity message. “I think we all bear some responsibility and we need to try to clean up our act and try to bring civility to our congress and frankly to our dialogue,” Stivers said. Luján added that Congress has a responsibility to move past "finger pointing." The calls for a more unified nation echo those of many Americans tired of the divisive politics inside the Washington Beltway. "It's like our country is becoming 'The Hunger Games,'" said Elisa Karem Parker, a voter in Kentucky. The volatile tribalism now so ingrained in American life will eventually right itself, says Robb Willer, a sociology professor at Stanford University, but not until the public decides it's had enough and stops rewarding politicians who use incendiary language and demonize the other side. It's impossible to guess, he notes, how much damage will be done in the meantime. "That is the question of our time: Are we going to choose to continue the war, or are we going to choose peace? And we don't know yet what the answer to that will be, because while a majority of Americans are fed up with the extremity of our political divisions, it does feel like we're stuck here," Willer says. "It will get worse before it gets better." Animosity between parties has been growing for decades now, to the point that studies show Republicans and Democrats don't want to date one another, don't want their children to marry one another and don't want to live in the same neighborhoods at a rate unprecedented in modern America. At the same time, politicians began using increasingly apocalyptic language. Willer says those two forces — the splintering of society along party lines and the ascent of vitriolic campaigning — merged to create a breeding ground for violence. There is little evidence the tide will turn soon. Moderates are becoming increasingly rare in Washington, D.C., and Republicans willing to criticize Trump's rhetoric, such as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, are not running for re-election. "You don't really have those reasonable voices kind of trying to bring everybody together," says Tom Freeman, a Republican attorney in Lincoln, Neb. "It's just kind of round and round we go, and the sides just get more and more extreme, and you don't have that rational leader in the crowd saying, 'Hey, let's dial it back.' The sad thing is, if you did have that person, I don't know that anyone would listen to them." Some already casting votes for the Nov. 6 midterm elections say they hope the system can self-correct. The future of the nation, the very concept of democracy, is at stake. "America is resilient; we find a way even in our darkest days," Cordell Lawrence, a 36-year-old voter from Kentucky, said. "Maybe we have to hit rock bottom before we find how to get back up," he added. "We're probably pretty close to rock bottom today. At least I hope we are."

Not long after, he received a text from his mother saying there had been a shooting near their home, Penn Live reported. The Hardin's house is "not more than 50 feet" from the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill, according to Penn Live, where 11 people were shot to death on Saturday. The Hardin family heard what sounded like automatic gunfire and gathered in the basement. "There were several police cars -- four or five -- in the street with officers hiding behind them and their guns drawn toward Tree of Life," Kim Hardin, Kenny's mother, told Penn Live. They heard a pounding on their back door. A SWAT team entered the home, and the officers said they needed to use the upstairs. They told Kenny's father, Ken, to move furniture to the closet in the master bedroom. "The windows directly face the synagogue, and they used the furniture to mount their sniper rifles," Kim said to Penn Live. Over the next hour, Kenny, whose came was postponed because of the shooting, didn't hear from his family. He listened from a police scanner, according to Penn Live.

Nicholas, who is 10 years old and the youngest son in the family, believes he saw an officer get shot, according to Penn Live. The Hardins have friends who attend the synagogue. The victims had yet to be named at the time the Penn Live story was published - you can find their names here - but Kim was certain the impact would be felt. "The degree of separation won't be more than one or two people," she said. "Everybody is going to know somebody that was affected by this." Read the full Penn Live article here.

USA TODAY Americans own 42% of about 650 million civilian firearms worldwide, according to the Small Arms Survey. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) This article was originally published after the Las Vegas shooting. It has been updated to reflect the shooting in Parkland, Fla. "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." — The Second Amendment The battle over guns has proven to be one of the most dangerous in America's culture wars — and with the murder of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, the debate over how to regulate them continues. The argument over gun control isn't merely about safety. It's about identity. The gun has transcended its function as a weapon to become a powerful cultural marker. It can signal what kind of person you are, and often to which tribe you belong. "It's not about the guns. The guns are a symbol," said David Ropeik, author of How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts. Gun symbolism, social scientists say, was shaped by the nation's history. It has associations with the frontier and wars, with power and manhood. In modern political debates, it's associated with the idea of liberty from a "government [that] does too much to protect us and tramples on our personal rights," Ropeik said. When a gun carries that kind of cultural significance, it's "a powerful image to fight against" if you're a gun control advocate, said John Donohue, a Stanford University law professor and gun policy expert, "and one that is largely immune from rational discussion." Gun culture isn't just about "personal identity," said Adam Lankford, author of the 2015 study “Mass Shooters, Firearms, and Social Strains: A Global Analysis of an Exceptionally American Problem." The University of Alabama criminal justice professor said it's also about "shared identity — 'Do I fit in with my friends and family, according to the way we view the world and our values?'" GUNS:Americans make up 4.4% of world population but own 42% of world civilian firearms "For one side, guns represent aggression, violence, and a somewhat paranoid and anachronistic perspective that you have to protect yourself from external threats," Lankford said. "For the other side, guns represent safety, security, and self-sufficiency — and wrapped up in some of that is often a form of traditional masculinity whereby the man of the house must be able to physically protect his family." Justin Sollie, 27, is a libertarian-leaning Republican in Meridian, Miss. He grew up hunting, just like his father, and his grandfather before him. Sollie, a high school math teacher, owns guns for hunting and personal protection, but says he supports tighter restrictions on guns, including a ban on high capacity semi-automatic weapons. Sollie knows many people in his community would not. "It's the idea of guns and gun culture that matters more than the gun itself," he said. To many Southerners, guns are "freedom." Freedom from oppression People "cling" to their weapons because of "ingrained distrust of the government," Sollie said. Gun control advocates, he said, aren't fighting something tangible — they're fighting ideology. The debate is notably partisan — or as Ropeik calls it, "tribal." National polls show a clear split. According to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center, 91% of Republican and Republican-leaning gun owners say owning a gun is essential to their freedom vs. 43% of Democrats/Democrat-leaning gun owners. And even Republican non-owners are more likely than Democratic owners to view it as an essential right (61% vs.43%). We are social animals and pressure to be loyal to party or tribe is strong, experts say. "We aren't 325 million individuals who make up our individual opinions based on the facts," Lankford said. Frustrated by lack of action after a student killed nine people at an Oregon college in 2015, President Obama said gun violence is “something we should politicize." On the other side, gun rights groups gave $5.8 million to members of Congress in 2016, 98% of which went to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The non-partisan group that tracks campaign spending also reported that in just the 2016 presidential race, the National Rifle Association spent $10.6 million to support Donald Trump and $19.7 million to oppose Hillary Clinton. The NRA puts out messaging about an intrusive government that wants to "take your guns," while its "pro-gun" lobbying opposes gun control measures. It has been successful. The NRA has not responded to repeated requests for comment. However, it has historically accused opponents of exploiting mass shootings to push for restrictions they say demonize law-abiding gun owners. It seems as though the divide is impossibly stark, but experts say Americans share more in common than their Facebook feeds would suggest. Large majorities in both parties support preventing the mentally ill and people on no-fly lists from buying guns, as well as background checks, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April of 2017. "Everyone for the most part is for safety and against senseless terror and death," said Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University. "There's a sense of commonality. I think the problem is that it's very hard to find rhetoric that's not polarizing, considering that this debate is so beholden to so many different interests on all sides." The desire for safety is basic and universal. The disagreement is over whether guns actually make one safer. Three in ten American adults say they own a gun and 67% say protection is a major reason, Pew reports, despite a 2016 review in the journal Epidemiologic Reviews of 130 studies that found firearm restrictions are associated with fewer deaths. Investigation: Gun accidents kill at least 1 kid every other day It's simple, my gun(s) allow me to defend myself should I ever need to. It's really that simple. It's why gun sales spike after mass shootings, and why even people who know the data on gun safety find themselves internally debating whether they should own a gun. After the Sandy Hook shooting, Lankford, the criminal justice professor whose 2015 study found the nation's gun ownership rate to be the strongest predictor of its number of public mass shooters, said he was asked if he would feel safer if professors on campus were armed. "My answer was, 'I would feel safer if I had a gun, but I wouldn't feel safer if all professors were armed.' It really is a double standard. I trust myself, but I don't trust others," he said. Lawrence Rutt, 48, an Army Special Forces veteran in Austin, Texas, didn't have a gun at home until this year, after he witnessed a drug bust while traveling for work. He said the incident rattled him, and he bought a 9mm handgun. Rutt, a Democrat, says he supports stricter gun control measures and wonders aloud what it will take to change public policy. "It's just a sad, sad moment when reporters ask the press secretary, 'when are we going to evaluate gun laws, and she said 'it's not the time.' Why is it not time to address gun laws right after a massacre in Las Vegas?" Rutt asked. "This was over 600 rounds. That is crazy. Holy mackerel, that's a lot of rounds." Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock had an arsenal of 23 weapons in his hotel suite, including semiautomatic rifles. He possessed a little-known device called a “bump stock," which allows a semi-automatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon by unleashing an entire large magazine in seconds. Las Vegas shooting: Bupkis done on bump stocks As the nation grapples with yet another macabre tragedy, many Americans are bewildered, fighting resignation in the face of a kind of violence that has begun to feel inevitable. "The gun control argument is about fears," Ropeik said. "Some people are afraid of themselves or others being shot. Some people are afraid of losing control over their lives in a deeper, broader more comprehensive sense. That fear is deeper, and that fear is winning. Unless we validate that fear and respect it, it'll stay a battle with no solution." A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Robert Bowers, the suspect in Saturday’s mass shooting at the synagogue, expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and told officers afterward that Jews were committing genocide and he wanted them all to die, according to charging documents made public Sunday. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP) The nation’s latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square. “In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence,” he said. He prayed for God “to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that “all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere.” Trump on Saturday said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue “had some kind of protection” from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again “dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.” Calling the shooting an “evil anti-Semitic attack,” Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh but offered no details. In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation’s political climate. “When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,” said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.npr.org/2018/10/28/661532688/a-look-at-gab-the-free-speech-social-site-where-synagogue-shooting-suspect-poste---split---James Doubek The suspect in the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue was reported to be a user of Gab, a small social networking site that prides itself on providing a platform for free speech — but has become a gathering point for far-right users. An account linked to Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident, wrote on Gab Saturday morning: "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." HIAS is the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish nonprofit group that has the goal of helping refugees. Bowers said he had a "desire to kill Jewish people," U.S. attorney Scott Brady told reporters Sunday morning. Bowers used anti-Semitic slurs on Gab and called Jews an "infestation" and a "problem," according to the Anti-Defamation League. Bowers also used the common white supremacist slogan "1488" in his profile, the group says, combining the classic white supremacist "14 words" with 88, which is code for "Heil Hitler." Gab posted a message on Medium after Saturday's shooting, saying, "Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. This has always been our policy. We are saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh and are keeping the families and friends of all victims in our thoughts and prayers." The site said it took down the account linked to Robert Bowers and has been in contact with law enforcement and is ready "to see to it that justice is served. https://t.co/J3Rfto6fi3 Statement On The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting https://t.co/XU9Apd0cUD Andrew Torba, who co-founded Gab and is its CEO, has said the network was made to "step up and defend free speech, defend individual liberty, defend the free flow of information that I saw under attack." Torba is a Trump supporter who was reportedly "once kicked out of the prestigious Silicon Valley tech accelerator Y Combinator's alumni network for calling his colleagues 'cucks,' " The Daily Beast reported. A casual scroll through Gab's message boards finds plenty of anti-Semitism, racism, Nazism and sexism running through its messages, along with conspiracy theories. The website boasts plenty of standard social media fare as well, including messages about music, art and sports. As NPR's Alina Selyukh reported last year, "many members of the far right and others who feel their views are stifled by mainstream sites like Twitter and Facebook" have gravitated toward Gab, with its promise of few restrictions on speech. The site often responds to critics by pointing blame to Twitter and Facebook and other social media sites for the speech that can be found on those platforms: If you use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit: you are using platforms that are used by terrorists, pedophiles, and criminals every single day. Christopher Cantwell, a white nationalist who became known and was arrested after last year's Unite the Right rally, has a page on Gab. Paypal cut the website off from its payment system on Saturday, according to Gab's Twitter feed. Paypal cited Gab's allowing "the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance" as the reason, The Verge reports. BREAKING: https://t.co/J3Rfto6fi3 is now banned from Paypal "just because." pic.twitter.com/VA1NhY5zhr Gab said later on Saturday that its hosting provider Joyent pulled its service for the site effective Monday, meaning "Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this." The site's community standards have loose restrictions without an explicit ban on hate speech. They do, however, ban users from "calling for the acts of violence against others," and "threatening language or behaviour that clearly, directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user or individual(s)." Gab is headquartered in Philadelphia as of March and also lists an address in Clarks Summit, Penn., in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. It says it has two employees. Gab launched in private beta in August 2016 before opening to the public in May 2017, according to a fundraising page for the site. Since then its user base has grown from 300,000 users in November of last year to about 800,000 today, the company says. In a filing with the SEC in March, the site's operators say they expect to appeal to "over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users" who use sites like Breitbart, DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com as people leave social networks that "censor conservative views."

---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pittsburgh-congregation-leaders-20181028-story.html---split---A year and a half ago, before becoming the target of the deadliest attack on Jewish people in U.S. history, the Dor Hadash congregation in Pittsburgh’s historic Squirrel Hill neighborhood came together and made a well-meaning decision. The lay-led Reconstructionist Judaism congregation of about 150 families, whose progressive-leaning members take turns leading services at their synagogue, determined that one of its priorities would be to support immigration and refugee issues. So the congregation partnered with HIAS, a Jewish-founded nonprofit that helps resettle refugees from around the world. Dor Hadash “stands for diversity, inclusion … for LGBT rights, we have leaders from the LGBT community, we have mixed marriages, we have people of color in the congregation … you get the picture,” Carolyn Ban, a 75-year-old retired professor who chairs the congregation’s social-justice committee, said in a phone interview Sunday. “This is a very socially engaged congregation.” Ban, who led the congregation’s Shabbat for refugees in partnership with HIAS this month, was at her Squirrel Hill home Saturday morning, shortly before Dor Hadash’s services were set to begin, when she got an email from a Muslim friend in one of her interfaith discussion groups. “What’s happening at Dor Hadash?” her friend wrote. “There is an active shooter alert in the neighborhood.” A gunman armed with an AR-15 and three handguns, who had shared neo-Nazi posts on social media, had burst into their synagogue, which is also shared by two conservative Jewish congregations, and opened fired as the groups’ services were getting underway, killing 11 people. It does not seem to have been a random attack. On Oct. 10, the shooting suspect, Robert Bowers, of Pittsburgh, had posted a list of HIAS’ partners on social media, which included Dor Hadash. Then, in the moments before the shooting, Bowers posted again, writing that “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people” — suggesting that the Dor Hadash congregation may have been his specific alleged target due to its refugee advocacy work. One of the Dor Hadash members, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, who was helping set up for the morning’s services, was killed, and another member, Dan Leger, was wounded, Ban said. Both men had dedicated their lives to helping others. Rabinowitz was a primary-care physician and Leger is a hospital chaplain, Ban said. Leger had been in charge of the congregation’s “loving kindness” committee and was often responsible for weddings, funerals and helping hospitalized members. “Now we’ll be helping him,” Ban said. Ban’s voice began to catch and grow unsteady as she discussed the gunman at the synagogue — and his possible motive of attacking Dor Hadash for its support for immigrants and refugees. “I’m very proud of the work we do … we have no second thoughts about that,” Ban said. “Many of us, frankly, feel great pity for this man, because he must have been in terrible pain to do such a thing.” Ban’s voice broke, and on the phone, she fell silent for a few seconds. “Really, that’s the conversations I’ve been having today with people.” She thought President Trump’s suggestion that an armed guard could have prevented the massacre was wrong. She pointed out that the gunman came in with an AR-15. He wounded four police officers before he was captured. “An armed guard would have been able to do nothing,” Ban said. “The other thing is, this does not change my strong opposition to the death penalty, which would accomplish nothing and be counter to our values.” The other priority that Dor Hadash had singled out for its advocacy a year and a half ago was criminal justice reform. But it’s too early to say what the congregation’s official collective, long-term response to the shooting will be, Ban said. A local church has donated space for the congregation to meet. “We welcome anybody to join our congregation who shares a commitment to social justice and social action and who wants to be part of a caring, loving community,” Ban said. Dor Hadash may have come under attack, but its doors remain very much open.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-opposes-trumps-call-arm-synagogues-153259200.html---split---Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said he disagreed with President Trump’s suggestion that arming houses of worship rather than stronger gun control laws would stop mass shootings. Peduto shared this opinion Sunday morning at a press conference about the anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in the historic Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill. The gunman killed 11 worshipers and wounded six others, including four police officers. “I’ve heard the president’s comments about how we should arm guards in our synagogues, our churches, our mosques. I’ve heard the conversation over the past year about how we should arm security guards in our schools,” Peduto said. He said we are dealing with irrational behavior and that there’s no way to rationalize a person walking into a synagogue during services and killing 11 people. “We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior. We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this kind of carnage from continuing,” Peduto said. Authorities said the suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin, Pa., was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts. The Anti-Defamation League said it is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history. According to Peduto, the United States needs to figure out how to take guns out of the hands of violent people rather than arming synagogues. “I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns — which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America — out of the hands of those who are looking to express hatred through murder,” he said. Trump’s first remarks about the shooting on Saturday was that the United States should “stiffen up” death penalty laws. When asked whether the tragedy indicates that there should be stricter gun control, Trump said that it would have been better if the synagogue had armed guards. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. If they had some kind of protection within the temple it could have been a much better situation. They didn’t,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. This is a point he repeated several times: “This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside they may have been able to stop him immediately, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him maybe.” Trump proposed similar measures in the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed. Rather than limit access to firearms, Trump supported the idea that trained teachers and other faculty members should carry concealed weapons in schools so they could protect the students in the event of an active shooter. This is not the first time Peduto spoke out against Trump. He’s been a vocal critic since Trump announced his intention to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement to fight climate change in June 2017. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said at the time. Western Pennsylvania, which has a long and celebrated history of energy production for the country, has made great strides toward clean energy in recent years. Under Peduto, Pittsburgh is aiming to transition to 100 percent renewable-energy sources by 2035. _____ Read more from Yahoo News:

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitchcon-security-anxiety_us_5bd4eb9ce4b055bc948c9dde---split---SAN JOSE, Calif. ― Annual live-streaming convention TwitchCon is underway here this weekend, drawing in tens of thousands of gamers from around the world. It follows a deadly shooting at a similar event in late August, leaving many Twitch users anxious about attending the convention and disturbed by what some called “lax” security measures there. Chad Zinger and his wife drove 27 hours from their home in Edmonton, Alberta, to attend TwitchCon this year. After spending about four hours in line to get their entrance badges on Friday, they were shocked that getting through security took “less than a minute.” “[Security staff] didn’t even ask us to take off our bags or set them on the table, they just waved us through,” said 32-year-old Zinger. He said he went in and out of the venue several times over the weekend, and to his surprise, the vape and large batteries in his bag set off a metal detector only at the venue’s smaller side entrance, but not when he entered through the main doors. “It makes me extremely uncomfortable, considering what happened in August,” he said. Zinger and other attendees told HuffPost they felt TwitchCon organizers had decreased security measures to expedite the entry process. The line to enter the venue on Friday, the first day of the convention, wrapped around the San Jose McEnery Convention Center and down an alleyway, causing many attendees to miss the panels they’d traveled to see and prompting Twitch to send an apology email later that evening. On Saturday morning, less than two hours after a mass shooting claimed at least 11 lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a HuffPost reporter passed through TwitchCon security without undergoing a bag check or putting her bag through a metal detector. Twitch streamer Keith Isaia said he had a similar experience on Friday when he set his bag down at the security table, walked through a metal detector without it, and a security guard returned his bag to him without opening it. “I told [the security guard], ‘You didn’t look in my bag,’ and she said, ‘We’re not supposed to,’” according to Isaia, who said he then requested to speak to a manager. “After I explained the situation, [the manager] said they’re doing the best that they can,” he said. “Another guard came over and basically shooed us in. I reminded him then that someone still had not looked inside my bag. The initial guard picked up my bag, set it back down, and said ‘It’s fine. We’re just checking it for weight.’” HuffPost did not witness the interaction Isaia described. A San Jose police officer told HuffPost that around 240 people, including 40 police officers, were securing the venue on Saturday. Twitch said it could not confirm the number of security staff at the convention, but emphasized that there is a heightened security presence compared to previous conventions. In an emailed statement on Sunday, Twitch said it had shared “the reported attendee experiences” with convention security staff, and reiterated safety procedures. “The security of our attendees is our top priority,” a Twitch spokesperson said. “All bags are required to be checked.” At the Madden video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Aug. 26, a gunman opened fire on gaming competitors, killing three people and injuring 11 others. At least one survivor from the incident, which was captured on a Twitch livestream, has filed a negligent security lawsuit. Just weeks after the Jacksonville shooting, prominent streamer Herschel “Guy” Beahm, known on Twitch as Dr DisRespect, was reportedly the target of two drive-by shootings while live-streaming in his home. Twitch responded to subsequent calls for enhanced security at TwitchCon by issuing a press release promising stringent safety measures including banning backpacks and doing on-site bag checks. That “simply didn’t happen,” according to 30-year-old Cody Melcher. “[Twitch] sent out an email promising heightened security, but we just walked right through security without even opening our bags,” said Melcher, who waited in line with his friends to pick up their entrance badges for more than four hours on Friday. “My friends and I were blown away. It seems like they were prioritizing speed over security.” For some Twitch users, going to TwitchCon felt like too great a risk to take this year. Shortly after the reported attacks against Dr DisRespect, a popular streamer known on the platform as “Ellohime” announced he was uneasy about attending TwitchCon out of fear for his safety. “[I] don’t feel safe in America,” Ellohime tweeted at the time. He is not at TwitchCon. Several streamers on Twitch and other platforms have, in recent years, been victims of doxing and swatting, meaning anonymous trolls have posted their private information ― often including addresses and phone numbers ― online, or sent police officers to the location they’re live-streaming from. Doxing and swatting are sometimes done as pranks, but the consequences can be fatal. In December 2017, a police officer shot and killed 28-year-old Andrew Finch, who was reportedly the target of a Twitch user’s swatting attack. “I’ve had all my private information released publicly,” said Isaia. “Live-streaming can put you in a vulnerable position if you aren’t careful. Similar to this event, with not having all the bags checked, it could go badly quickly.” This story has been updated with a response from Twitch.
---split---3.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspect-synagogue-slayings-spewed-online-hate-jews-221934701.html---split---WASHINGTON (AP) — The man arrested in the mass shooting Saturday at a Pennsylvania synagogue appears to have made virulently anti-Semitic posts on a social media platform popular with far-right extremists, including one made shortly before the attack. Police have identified the suspect as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh. A man with the same name posted on the site Gab.com on the morning of the shooting that "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." HIAS is a Maryland-based nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history. President and CEO Mark Hetfield said he wasn't aware of the shooter's "obsession with HIAS until this morning." The shooter opened fire at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, killing 11 people and wounding at least six others including four police officers. Bowers was wounded in a shootout with police and was reported to be in custody Saturday at a nearby hospital. President Donald Trump characterized the mass shooting as an anti-Semitic attack and law enforcement officials said they were investigating it as a hate crime. Bowers has no apparent criminal record. He was registered in Allegany County, which includes Pittsburgh, as an unaffiliated voter. Heavily armed officers responded to an apartment building in Pittsburgh on Saturday afternoon that may have been associated with Bowers. In a statement, Gab.com said it suspended the alleged gunman's account Saturday morning shortly after his name was mentioned on police radio chatter. The company said it backed up the content of the account and notified the FBI. Gab has become an alternative to Twitter for users whose racist and harassing online behavior got them banned from the mainstream platform. The company said it disavows acts of terrorism and violence, but sees its mission as defending "free expression and individual liberty online for all people." Gab founder and CEO Andrew Torba declined to answer emailed questions posed by an AP reporter. A post made on the site's Twitter account on Saturday appeared to revel in the attention prompted by the killings, saying "We have been getting 1 million hits an hour all day." The Associated Press reviewed an archived version of the posts made under Bowers' name. The screen name @onedingo, used on the Gab account, matches email addresses listed for Bowers in online databases that contain the same "onedingo" moniker. In the description on his account, Bowers wrote "jews are the children of satan." The cover photo featured the neo-Nazi symbol "1488." The first two numbers refer to the white supremacist "14 Words" slogan, while "88" stands for "Heil Hitler" since "H'' is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Among his recent posts, Bowers posted a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews, writing the caption "Make Ovens 1488F Again." But in other posts he also featured memes containing false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust — in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished — was a hoax. Another post derided Trump for being "a globalist, not a nationalist" and added that "there is no #MAGA" as long as there is a Jewish "infestation," using a slur for Jews. The same post also referenced QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory that started on the message board 4chan and has been spread by a fringe element of the president's supporters. Bowers also recently posted a photo of a collection of three black semi-automatic handguns he titled "my glock family," a reference to the Austrian firearms manufacturer. He also posted photos of bullet holes in person-sized targets at a firing range, touting the "amazing trigger" on his weapon. ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.

(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) TUCSON, Ariz. — Rep. Ron Barber guides his Ford through the flat, four-lane paved streets, ticking off landmarks on the corners of his desert city surrounded by jagged mountains. That’s Rincon High School, where he enrolled as a sophomore in 1959. There’s the middle school his grandson attends. As he makes a left turn, Barber points to St. Cyril of Alexandria Church, where he married his wife, Nancy, 47 years ago. “It was the middle of the summer, and what do you know, the air conditioner broke,” he recalled, driving by rows of adobe office parks. On the opposite corner of the church is another Barber landmark, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' office, where he worked as her district director for several years. One memory sticks out: On the night of the Affordable Care Act vote, he put out a press release and left around midnight. A couple of hours later, someone shattered the office door and window. He said they later discovered bullets inside. It’s not the most notorious time Barber risked gunfire — not even close. At the main gate of the University of Arizona campus, the former state bureaucrat gestures up the road toward the trauma center where he was treated after a gunman killed six and injured a dozen more, including Barber and Giffords, in January 2011. This is not the route Barber expected to follow.“If you’ve never run for office before, it’s a huge jump for everyone,” Barber recalled telling his wife when they first decided he would run for Giffords’ seat. “She saw what happened on Jan. 8.” The 68-year-old Democrat is running his third big campaign for Giffords’ seat in the highly competitive 2nd District. He’ll face one of the GOP’s top recruits of the cycle, retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally, at a time when the national political landscape favors Republicans. The Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call rates the 2nd District as a Tossup . Polls show a deadlocked race, and Barber's victory partially depends on how he tells his own tale of Tucson — not that of his former boss. ‘Gabby-fied’ Barber maneuvers through the downtown college campus where he majored in political science decades earlier. He recalled his bachelor buddies dunking him in the fountain in front of “Old Main” before his wedding — a local tradition, he swears. The father of two touts Tucson like it’s as exciting as New York City, or Austin, Texas. The 2nd District includes east Tucson and the southeast corner of Arizona, bordering both New Mexico and Mexico. It’s nearly 30 minutes into the driving tour of his hometown before Barber brings up Giffords. “I have not had one regret,” he said later. “I learned so much from this woman who is the same age as my eldest daughter.” He first met Giffords, then a state legislator, during his 30-year-long tenure with the region's Division of Developmental Disabilities. She would attend their information sessions for lawmakers, and he was impressed by her diligence and generosity. After winding through a recently renovated downtown, Barber points to the federal court house where U.S. District Judge John Roll presided until he was killed by the crazed shooter. As Barber passed Sentinel Peak, also known as "A" mountain because of the massive university letter on its summit, he recalled another long drive. It was 2005. He was returning from Phoenix when he heard on local radio that Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe was retiring. Barber learned Giffords was thinking about running, and asked his wife if he could retire and help. Barber said he hadn’t worked on a campaign since Mo Udall represented the 2nd District decades earlier. He served as Giffords' community outreach director as the Democrat navigated a crowded primary and won her first term in 2006. Forgoing retirement plans, Barber was set to take a university gig when Giffords asked him to be her district director. Barber, right, with Rothschild, mayor of Tucson. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) He didn’t hesitate, partnering with Gabe Zimmerman to set up Giffords’ office. (Zimmerman also died that January day.) Barber pushed the congresswoman to let him hire outside-the-box aides instead of campaign allies for his top priority, constituent services. “It’s about fighting bureaucracy,” he described. “Dig into the soft part of their anatomy and hold on.” Four years later, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire, showering bullets on a Giffords constituent service event in front of the Casas Adobes Safeway. Barber was shot twice — through the neck and in his leg. Today, he can’t feel his leg below the knee, and a dimple on his left cheek marks a bullet wound. Giffords spent months recovering from gunshot wounds to the head, embarking on a long journey to regain her mobility and speech that caused her ultimately to resign a year later. She asked Barber to seek her seat in a 2012 special election. “I think he’s a political junkie, but he never actually saw himself holding office,” said Joni Jones, an office manager for Giffords and Barber. Learning to Fly It’s lunchtime in the Mo Udall Room at downtown’s El Charro, a restaurant that claims to have invented the chimichanga but is really known for the carne seca, beef that’s been dried on the roof. To say Barber is well known in Tucson is an understatement. The British-born congressman owned a used toy store, Toy Trader/Stork’s Nest. One of his aides recalled buying a car seat for her little sister there years before they worked together. “He was a longtime public servant in the community,” said Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild, a Democrat who has known Barber since the 1990s. “It should help him a lot. He’s done an excellent job as our congressman.” Since the shooting, Barber's face and name has been blasted on the Tucson airwaves. It isn't always flattering: His second-time foe, McSally, has chided him for supporting national Democrats, including President Barack Obama's health care law, which Giffords backed. McSally's victory depends on whether she can convince the district's large swath of independent voters that he's not. Barber at El Charro in Tucson. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) “I watch a lot of TV, and you are on it all the time,” one restaurant patron tells the congressman as they shake hands. Lucky for Barber, his fellow diner meant this in the good way. As Barber sips his Arnold Palmer, he remembers he resigned as district director on a Tuesday. He knew he would announce his campaign for Congress that Thursday. On Wednesday, he woke up with one thought. “The next day I would be staffed, instead of staffing,” he recalled. “I had to kind of let go. I just had to pry myself off from the day to day details.” The first month of campaigning was grueling as Barber was still recovering — emotionally and physically — from the shooting. The mild-mannered grandfather of five struggled with public speaking and the evil necessity of sound bites. He said he’s still learning how to speak briefly, and he drives his staff crazy by staying too late at events talking to people. They give him looks, then nudge his arm, and finally put a strategic hand on his upper back. He knows the drill: He used to do the same with Giffords. “I should have learned from that, but I didn’t," he said. He recalled visiting the Safeway for the first time after the incident, where “the spot where we were shot seemed so small to me.” “What you went through with Gabby was amazing,” offered another restaurant patron who approached the table. He fondly remembers Giffords’ left eyebrow, which he could rely upon to send a signal of approval or disapproval for the topic at hand. A close-up photo of Barber and Giffords welcomes guests into his campaign headquarters in a mideast Tucson office park. Today, they see each other at events every couple weeks, including just after Giffords commemorated the third anniversary of the shooting by sky diving. “Gabby, you always set the bar high,” he told her. “But I’m not jumping out of a plane.” Related Stories: The 10 Most Vulnerable House Members On the Road: Arizona Ron Barber Airs First TV Ad (Video) Republicans Circulate List of Top Female House Candidates NRCC Reserves $30 Million for TV Ads in 2014 Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-afghanistan-kandahar-attack-20181018-story.html#nt=related-content---split---At least two senior Afghan officials, including a powerful police chief, were killed and two Americans were injured Thursday when an Afghan security guard opened fire at the provincial governor’s compound in Kandahar province, officials said. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan had just left a meeting at the compound and was unhurt, but the shooting claimed the life of a key U.S. ally: Abdul Raziq, the Kandahar police chief and one of the most reliable — and controversial — commanders in the 17-year war against the Taliban. Afghan officials said the provincial intelligence chief was also killed, and there were unconfirmed reports that the provincial governor had died of injuries sustained in the shooting. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, one of the most devastating assassinations of the war, and said its targets were Raziq and Army Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, the commander of U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan. Afghan news media reported that the gunman was wearing the uniform of the Afghan security forces and was a member of the provincial leadership’s security team. A statement from the U.S.-led NATO coalition described the shooting as “an Afghan-on-Afghan incident.” It said Miller had escaped unharmed and three coalition personnel had been wounded and were medically evacuated. They included a U.S. service member, an American civilian and a coalition contractor whose nationality was not immediately released. The death of Raziq, who was about 40, came two days before parliamentary elections nationwide and many feared it could add fuel to a recent surge by the Taliban by opening up a leadership void in pivotal Kandahar. Security across the country is deteriorating as Taliban militants defy U.S. and Afghan peace overtures with offensives across multiple provinces that have made 2018 one of the bloodiest years in the war. The United Nations said 5,122 civilians were killed or wounded in the first six months of the year, the highest total since it began recording casualties in 2009. Graeme Smith, an analyst and author of a book on the Afghan war, called Raziq’s death “potentially the most significant assassination in a conflict that has witnessed thousands of them.” If reports are true about the death of General Abdul Raziq, this marks a major inflection point in the Afghan war. Potentially the most significant assassination in a conflict that has witnessed thousands of them. The assassination of Gen. Raziq in Kandahar shows once again that military analysis of the Afghan war, troop numbers, conditions vs. timetable, is mostly irrelevant. Afghan governments fall because of internal weakness and loss of foreign support, not because of military defeat. Raziq, a boyish police official with a reputation for ruthlessness, rose to prominence as head of the provincial border police and was credited with containing the insurgency in Kandahar, a traditional Taliban stronghold. Raziq’s zeal endeared him to the U.S.-led coalition and allowed him to shrug off credible allegations from human rights groups that his men tortured and killed civilians. For much of the war, U.S. commanders furnished Raziq’s forces with weapons and support in exchange for promises of protection for American forces in Kandahar, according to security analysts and former U.S. officials. “The Americans lost a steadfast ally with whom they had worked so well for so many years and on whom they had come to depend so much,” said Ahmad Shuja Jamal, an Afghan analyst and editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Public Policy Review. Raziq, who operated out of a heavily guarded compound in the center of Kandahar that had once belonged to the Taliban’s late founder, Mullah Mohammed Omar, had survived dozens of attempts on his life. In 2012, he was wounded in a massive bombing that killed four civilians and wounded about 20 others. This year, a suicide bomber posing as a journalist was stopped trying to enter one of Raziq’s news conferences with a bomb hidden inside a microphone. All of that only added to his mystique, which was built on violence and buttressed by the impunity he was afforded. The U.N. committee on torture last year called for Raziq to be prosecuted over reports that his forces had abused and suffocated Afghan prisoners, many of whom died in custody. Raziq — whom Human Rights Watch labeled “Kandahar's torturer-in-chief” — steadfastly denied the allegations. Special correspondent Faizy reported from Kabul and Times staff writer Bengali from Mumbai, India. 10:05 a.m.: This article was updated with three coalition personnel wounded. 9:25 a.m.: This article was updated throughout with the death of Abdul Raziq’s death and staff reporting.

Robert Bowers allegedly shot and killed at least 10 people and wounded others at the Tree of Life Congregation, which was full of people at the time. Police said he entered the building, made the anti-Semitic declaration, opened fire, and then barricaded himself inside before he was taken into custody. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice plans to file federal hate crime charges against Bowers, as well as “other criminal charges.” “The Department of Justice will continue to support our state and local partners and we will continue to bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people,” Sessions said in a Saturday afternoon statement. While a motive hasn’t been made official, it’s clear from Bowers’ online persona that he was a racist who held a deep hatred for Jewish people. He was active on Gab, a social media platform popular among neo-Nazis, and regularly posted racist and anti-Jewish sentiments. His biography on the site said: “jews are the children of satan.” Less than two hours before the shooting, he railed against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in increasingly desperate posts, saying that he’d had enough of the “hostile invaders” and was “going in.” “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he wrote. His profile was taken down shortly after 11:30 a.m. But archives of his activity on the platform showed that he was an anti-Semite who was critical of President Trump for not being a true “nationalist,” and openly discussed the QAnon conspiracy theory, a dangerous, all-encompassing conspiracy web that started online and has since wormed its way into real life. He regularly reposted neo-Nazi content and openly lambasted diversity. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he wrote on Thursday. “#Qanon is here to get patriots that were against martial law in the 90′s to be the ones begging for it now to drain muh swamp.” He had also commented on the capture of Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested in Florida on Friday after allegedly sending more than a dozen explosive devices to various high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros. He poked fun at Sayoc’s garish van, which was covered in pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers, as well as conspiracy theories and memes. Gab released a statement after the shooting, saying that the site doesn’t allow for calls to violence: “Gab.com’s policy on terrorism and violence have always been very clear: we a have zero tolerance policy for it. Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. This has always been our policy. We are saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh and are keeping the families and friends of all victims in our thoughts and prayers.” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said authorities were still trying to learn the “extent of this anti-Semitic attack.” “We are devastated,” he wrote on Twitter. “Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community.” This story has been updated with a statement from Jeff Sessions.

Eleven people were killed and six more were injured, including four police officers, when authorities say the suspect opened fire at the Tree of Life*Or L’Simcha congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. An assault rifle and three handguns were found on the suspect, Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, said during a press conference Saturday afternoon. (MORE: Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting claims 11 lives; 4 officers among multiple wounded, officials say) The suspect has been identified Robert Bowers, who is 46 years old. Bowers has several firearms and hunting licenses registered in his name and has addresses in the Pittsburgh area. "This is the most horrific crime scene I've ever seen," Jones said. Twenty-nine federal charges were filed against Bowers late Saturday, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. "On Saturday, October 27, 2018, at 8:05 p.m., U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell signed a criminal complaint charging Robert Bowers of Baldwin, Pa., with 29 counts setting forth federal crimes of violence and firearms offenses," the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania said in a statement. "The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes. The FBI in Pittsburgh is leading the investigation." The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. "The suspect's full motive is unknown but we believe he was acting alone," Jones added. By Saturday evening, residents of the Pittsburgh apartment building where Bowers appeared to be living most recently -- who had been evacuated earlier in the day -- were allowed back into their apartments. Neighbors who live in the complex described the suspect to ABC News as a quiet loner who lived alone and didn't stick out as any sort of danger. “The most terrifying thing is how normal he seemed,” remarked neighbor Chris Hall. Hall said he wished there had been "some type of warning sign." “I wish there was something tattooed on him or something that said ‘hey, this is what’s going on in my head.’” The Anti-Defamation League condemned the attack in a statement, saying it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," the ADL said in a statement. (MORE: After Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Trump champions armed guards, death penalty) The suspect is in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds at a local hospital after being taken into custody, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters during the press conference Saturday afternoon. At 9:54 a.m. Saturday, police received reports of an active shooter at Tree of Life, where a service was taking place, Hissrich said. The congregants were attending a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue, Pennsylvania's state attorney general told the Associated Press. There was also a morning Shabbat service scheduled from 9:45 a.m. to noon, according to the synagogue's website. After entering the church, Bowers allegedly killed at least 11 people, Jones said, and exchanged fire with officers, some of whom were injured. Bowers was also shot. He was taken into custody and brought to the hospital, Hissrich said. Law enforcement is looking closely at a social media account believed to be linked to the suspect. A counterterrorism official briefed on the probe says they are looking at Bowers' social media profiles, looking at what he allegedly posted and his conversations. Since the incident happened at a synagogue, it is being treated as a federal hate crime and will be handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the assistance of local, county and state police, he added. Upon arriving in Indiana for a speech before the Future Farmers of America, President Donald Trump called the attack an "anti-Semitic crime." "This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil, hard to believe, and frankly something that is unimaginable," Trump said at the start of the event. "Our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief. This was an anti-Semitic act. You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we don't seem to learn from the past." "The vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism must be condemned anywhere and everywhere it appears," he added. Speaking to reporters before boarding his flight to Indiana earlier in the day, Trump called the suspected shooter "a wacko" and a "maniac." He also said the suspect should "pay the ultimate price" and be subjected to the death penalty.

Early forecasts are already tossing the word around for a storm that could make its way up the East Coast this weekend. This weekend's possible nor'easter doesn't necessarily mean the first snowstorm of the year. While there could be high-terrain snow in Western Massachusetts and northern New England, Central and Eastern Massachusetts would likely see a miserably cold, windy stretch of rain. The National Weather Service said one variable to keep an eye on would be low temperatures. Friday could see the coldest air ... BOSTON — If there was any doubt, the city of Boston has an eye on finding ways to mitigate the impact of Climate Change.

Massachusetts could be looking at a warmer-than-usual winter, according to a new forecast. But that doesn't mean we'll be free from snow - or even have any less than usual. The National Weather Service announced its annual winter outlook this week, saying that Massachusetts will likely receive average amounts of precipitation. Whether it's snow, slush, or freezing rain, it'll come per usual. The service predicts a 70 to 75 percent chance of El Nino forming. The last El Nino did result in "Snowzilla" in 2015-16, but this would be a relatively weak El Nino, so don't expect to get pounded with... Welcome to Friday's Patch PM.

Days after more than 132,000 pounds of ground beef products were recalled over potential E. coli contamination, the federal government has released a list of retailers that sold the beef nationwide — including some in Massachusetts. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Cargill Meat Solutions last week recalled ground beef products made from the chuck portion of the carcass. The products were shipped to retail locations across the country, but neither the company nor the federal agency knew where all the meat was sent after it was sold to a distributor. This week, the USDA published list o... BOSTON, MA — A 42-year old Apple computer advertised as having helped start the age of the personal computer, not to mention a certain fruity trillion-dollar company, just sold for $375,000 in a private auction.

It was tested before the sale and worked, according to the listing. Such a computer fetched a pretty penny back when it was new -- around $700. But you don't see many computers older than a year being sold for more than $1... BOSTON, MA — Compounding Boston's affordable housing problem is a growing population.

---split---3.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMIeLhwsw2qeFAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---What are we supposed to think about political rage? Before and after the arrest of Cesar Sayoc, the suspect in the recent string of bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media figures, we were treated to any number of homilies about “rage” and its origins in “toxic” political rhetoric. Many of these homilies were pointed directly or indirectly at President Donald Trump and his immoderate Twitter habits. That political rage is necessarily linked to political violence was assumed, and sometimes asserted, but rarely argued. Five minutes before that, rage was all the rage. Rebecca Traister, an ... Eleven people were killed and six others wounded or otherwise injured when an anti-Semitic terrorist opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday morning. As of this writing, the murder victims, all adults, have not yet been publicly identified. Four of the wounded have been described as police officers. The shooter, who has been identified as Robert Bowers, 46, is in custody. He is said to have shouted, “All Jews must die!” during the shooting spree. The attack occurred a little before 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The synagogue is in the Squirrel Hill section of eastern... Griffin, Ga. — “Life happens,” Stacey Abrams instructs a small but boisterous crowd in a sun-drenched park south of Atlanta. She says: Your car breaks down. Your child gets sick. Could happen on Election Day. So, vote early. Today. In her campaign to be the first Democrat elected Georgia’s governor since 1998, and America’s first African-American female governor, she, even more than most Democrats, is depending on “low-propensity voters,” prodding to the polls many who have rarely voted in midterm elections. Chatting on her campaign bus, she exudes Yale Law School and the University of Texa... At least eight people were killed and a number of others injured Saturday morning in a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The suspect, 48-year-old Robert Bowers, burst into the synagogue during a service and began shooting indiscriminately while shouting “All Jews must die.” Bowers, who was armed with an AK-47 and two pistols, later surrendered after barricading himself in a room in the synagogue, according to a local CBS affiliate. Three of the responding officers were shot but their injuries are not life threatening. Michael Eisenberg, the former president of the Tree o... The people of Yemen are at risk of suffering famine unlike anything that has been seen in many years. Tens of thousands already have died of starvation and disease. Like practically all modern famines, this one is man-made, a product of politics. Political choices matter. Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its annual economic output is less than $1,000 per capita. With a population of 28 million, it has 1.2 million suspected cases of cholera, and thousands already have died from the disease. About a tenth of its economic output consists of the production of khat, a mild rec... King Leonidas had his 300. President Trump has his 800. That’s the number of soldiers Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered to the southern border to greet the caravan of illegal immigrants originating from Honduras. The band of families and singles, traveling en masse to avoid exploitation by smugglers and coyotes, now numbers 10,000 souls, according to one report. It may take them weeks to reach the United States. A second caravan is already taking shape behind the first. It won’t be the last. An unauthorized march on a border — any border — is a challenge to national sovereignty. And ... It’s now been ten years since I was first approached by Atlanta officials to be their city’s fire chief. Soon after, President Barack Obama asked me to leave Atlanta, to serve as U.S. fire administrator, the highest job a firefighter can have in this country. I was only a few months into that job when then-mayor Kasim Reed personally asked me to come back to the great city of Atlanta. He must have seen something he believed in. I know I did. I was honored to be asked back and delighted to return. It’s been five years since I wrote the book that caused all the trouble — on my own time, and a... On the afternoon of Thursday, September 13, as parents arrived at our school to pick up students, a journalist from a major network camouflaged herself among them, avoiding identification at our front gate. She was subsequently found snooping around the halls of our main building and was escorted off campus. She later apologized. But others soon followed. One reporter from a national newspaper deceived his way into our library so that he could rummage through old yearbooks. Some of our alumni had news crews staked out in front of their houses. Reporters were even harassing their elderly par... When he was 50, the prophet of Islam took as his wife Aisha, who was then six or seven. The marriage was consummated when Aisha was nine. This is not a smear. It is an accurate account of authoritative Islamic scripture. (See, e.g., Sahih-Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book 58, Nos. 234–236.) Yet it can no longer safely be discussed in Europe, thanks to the extortionate threat of violence and intimidation — specifically, of jihadist terrorism and the Islamist grievance industry that slipstreams behind it. Under a ruling by the so-called European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), free speech has been supplant... Years ago, when I was a museum director, I wanted to send an exhibition to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The curators balked. “But it’s an Italian museum!” In those days, American museums wouldn’t lend their art to a museum in Italy. Italian museums were notoriously unreliable. Security dated from the days of Leonardo. They didn’t have proper climate controls. The staff was presumed to follow the rules of “la dolce vita,” impassioned by Verdi and as convoluted. I reminded the recalcitrant curators of some simple facts. First, many Italian museums were modernizing. While I would... 1. In the Wall Street Journal: Boko Haram Put a Bounty on My Head 2.

Cesar Sayoc was arrested by federal authorities in Florida on Friday morning and charged with crimes related to sending 13 apparently homemade pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats. None of them detonated, but the FBI says the bombs indeed contained explosive material. Sayoc may well have meant to kill George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Cory Booker, and others.

Our needs are daunting, but our thoughts – about soliciting – are always a mix of humble and prudent. So we lowball our goal, even though it is nowhere near our true needs. So what was this webathon’s $200,000 goal (I thought at first: good luck reaching that!) then became $225,000 (a bridge too far?) when the response to our appeal seemed so broad and positive. And now as we are on the verge of achieving that amount (courtesy of the 2,300-or-so kind souls who have clicked on the CONTRIBUTE butto... Facebook on Friday deleted 82 accounts, groups, and pages associated with an Iranian propaganda campaign designed to exacerbate partisan outrage. The campaign, which consisted of 30 pages, 33 Facebook accounts, 16 Instagram accounts, and three groups, fixated on charged racial and political issues — such as Colin Kaepernick’s on-field protest movement and the battle over Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court — to incite anti-Republican and anti-Trump administration sentiment in users. The pages reached a combined audience of 1.02 million users and at least seven events were ho... Defamatory statements about the prophet Muhammad are not covered by free-speech protections, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday. The Strasbourg-based court found that insulting the prophet “goes beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate” and “could stir up prejudice and put at risk religious peace.” In its ruling, the court rejected an Austrian woman’s claim that her previous conviction for characterizing Muhammad as a “pedophile” violated her free-speech rights, finding instead that the Austrian court had “carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with... There’s been considerable drama at the Metropolitan Opera: uncontrolled lust, sexual onslaughts, towering figures undone by their recklessness. Some of this is even happening on the stage, as it is at a new production of Tosca. A thrilling, traditionalist take on the 1900 Puccini melodrama about a jealous opera singer, her painter boyfriend, and the wicked police chief who aspires to bed the former and kill the latter, this production debuted in a cloud of uncertainty on New Year’s Eve. (Ten months may be old for a White House scandal, but it’s fresh as this morning’s bagels in opera terms.... The chairman of the liberal Minnesota political party affiliated with Democrats said Wednesday that he does not believe the claims of Keith Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, who has accused the former congressman and current nominee for state attorney general of abuse. “I don’t believe her,” said Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, of Ellison’s accuser, Karen Monahan.

She claims to have a video of the bed incident but says she does not wish to ... NBC News learned in late September that a woman identified by Julie Swetnick as a witness to Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct denied ever having witnessed the misconduct, but failed to report that information until Wednesday evening. In preparation for an October 1 interview with Swetnick, NBC News contacted a woman she said could corroborate her allegation that Kavanaugh “spiked” the punch at numerous parties in high school in order to facilitate gang rapes. When contacted by NBC on September 30, the unidentified woman said she did not meet Swetnick until they were both adults, and deni... As my colleague Jack Crowe has noted, a bombing suspect is in custody. His name is Cesar Sayoc Jr., and as you can see the instant you log on to Twitter, he apparently drove a white van covered in pro-Trump stickers. That is not a vehicle a normal human being drives, and now I’m seeing the right side of the Internet light up with takes saying that he’s obviously “crazy.” Let’s use caution with that claim. It’s a word that can allow us to wrongly minimize the significance of the attack. There is a huge difference between obsessed, violent, unstable, and truly insane. And that difference matt... Yesterday afternoon, abortion-rights groups Planned Parenthood and NARAL took to Twitter to inform the world that they still believe Julie Swetnick, the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of having participated in routine gang rape of young women while he was in high school.

A lot of Democratic challengers have run ads against House Republicans who they say vote “with Trump” too often. I mentioned in passing the other day that I don’t think this statistic is very informative. At Bloomberg Opinion, I explain why. Over the past few years, I’ve gotten into the odd (and I suppose rather Jewish) habit of reading the entire cycle of the Federalist Papers each year, as close as I can manage to the anniversary of each paper’s publication. It’s easy to do. Most of the essays are about the length of a newspaper column, so it doesn’t take long to read them. I usually do it on the train on the way to the office, and it still leaves me plenty of time to read the news and get depressed. And while it is hard to imagine how Hamilton and Madison (and in a few cases John Jay) could have written such high-quality arg... The New York Times reports that two more pipe-bomb packages have been discovered: one sent to Obama-administration national intelligence director James Clapper, and a second addressed to Senator Cory Booker. This brings the total found up to twelve. You can bet there will be more. The package to former director Clapper was addressed to him at CNN’s offices. Clapper is now a CNN contributor. As we’ve previously noted, another bomb package was sent to CNN for former Obama CIA director John Brennan, though Brennan actually works for MSNBC.

It is the ancient Jewish expectation of persecution—when, where, has it not been with us?—married to American reality: a country saturated with guns and habituated to quotidian massacre, plagued by age-old racism and bigotry, which have lately been expertly inflamed by the holder of the highest office in the land. For the past few years, American Jews have glanced warily at Western Europe, where anti... At sunrise on Friday, after spending five hours trying to hitch a ride out of a tiny city in southern Mexico called Pijijiapan, Mauricio Ramos, a thirty-four-year-old Honduran, was questioning whether he should take his family any farther.

Armed with an automatic rifle, he shot seventeen people before police wounded and apprehended him. Eleven died. Kim, who taught orchestra in a nearby school unt... Speaking to the Future Farmers of America on Saturday afternoon, President Donald Trump addressed the shooting that killed eleven people at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, that morning. “This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil,” Trump said, “hard to believe and, frankly, something that is unimaginable.” A few hours earlier, he’d told reporters that “it’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world.” The world’s problems go back for years and years. “You could say, frankly, for many centuries,” Trump continued. But perha... What is there left to know about Donald Trump?

Last week, with the midterm elections fast approaching, law-enforcement agents pored over an accumulating pile of crude explosive devices that had been sent to some of the President’s most pr... A couple of hours before opening fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, Robert Bowers, the suspected gunman, posted on the social network Gab, “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people.

You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?” Another post that most likely referre... On Thursday night, in Carrollton, Georgia, near the Alabama line, Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, spoke to a crowd of two hundred and fifty supporters.

This past March, a small Catholic magazine called Women Church World ran an article titled “The (almost) free work of sisters.” In it, the journalist Marie-Lucile Kubacki described nuns who, among other menial tasks, serve meals to bishops and then eat in the kitchen, and who are paid little or nothing for the work they do. That institutional sexism pertains in the Catholic Church was not a shock, but the messenger was a surprise: Women Church World is published by the Vatican. The Associated Press ran a piece about the exposé, which was subsequently covered by the Times, PBS, and other out... Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least ten people, was not evasive about his intent. He reportedly made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting, and just beforehand posted on Gab, a right-wing social network, about H.I.A.S., a Jewish nonprofit that supports refugees. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.” Earlier, he had suggested that he supported far-right nationalism but believed that President Trump was captive to a Jewish conspiracy. ...

Many details have yet to emerge about the pipe bombs that targeted Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, John Brennan, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and George Soros. Mercifully, the Secret Service intercepted two of the packages, and none of the others exploded. So far, nobody has come forward claiming to have been the sender.

---split---4.0---split---https://sports.yahoo.com/rich-hill-wasnt-fan-president-donald-trump-tweeting-baseball-mass-shooting-223124062.html---split---Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill didn’t appreciate President Donald Trump criticizing Dave Roberts’ managing in Game 4 of the World Series. Hill, who was mentioned in Trump’s tweet, did not think it was acceptable for Trump to talk about baseball on the day of a mass shooting. Hill told reporters Sunday he believed Trump’s attention should have been focused on the country. Rich Hill on Trump’s tweet: “There was a mass shooting yesterday … The focus, in my opinion, of the president is to be on the country, and not on moves that are made in a World Series game.” — Bill Shaikin (@BillShaikin) October 28, 2018  Hill wasn’t the only player to take that stance. Houston Astros infielder Alex Bregman agreed with that sentiment. I’m just saying it’s funny how we are told to stick to playing sports… It’s very hypocritical when he’s telling Roberts how to manage…especially when a mass shooting just happened earlier that day… — Alex Bregman (@ABREG_1) October 28, 2018  Hill kept the Boston Red Sox off the scoreboard for 6 1/3 innings before he was pulled by Roberts. The Dodgers’ relievers couldn’t get the job done, allowing Boston to score nine runs over the final three innings to win the game. Trump criticized the decision to remove Hill from the contest, calling it a “big mistake.” As Hill stated, his issue with the tweet had to do with its timing. Eleven people were killed by a gunman at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh early Saturday morning. Trump tweeted about the attack twice, saying the country was “in mourning,” and adding that the “anti-semitic attack is an assault on humanity.” Members of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins spoke out as well, offering words of encouragement and prayers for those impacted by the shooting. The Steelers held a moment of silence for the victim’s prior to their game against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. The Red Sox and Dodgers are set to play Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night. The Red Sox lead the series 3-1, and can become World Series champions with another win. – – – – – – – Chris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

---split---4.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/swatting-deadly-online-gaming-prank/---split---The typical Wichita City Council meeting is a dull affair, dominated by bureaucrats droning on about street repairs, zoning codes, and general obligation bonds. But even before the April 17, 2018, meeting was called to order, its atmosphere was electric. As the council’s wood-paneled chambers filled up that Tuesday morning, a dozen or so spectators made a point of settling into the front rows. A group of women wore matching black T-shirts that read "Arrest WPD officer Justin Rapp." And when the police department’s spokesperson came forward to offer the opening prayer, several in the group refused to stand. Mayor Jeff Longwell, who oversees the weekly meetings, appeared to dread the drama he knew was about to come. After reading an Arbor Day proclamation and cracking a wan joke about his poor gardening skills, he sank into his high-backed leather chair and wearily asked the clerk to call the next item on the agenda. The clerk announced the name of a Wichita resident who’d asked to address the council, as well as her chosen topic: “Lisa Finch. Andrew Finch shooting.” A woman in the audience got up and walked gingerly down the right-hand aisle. She had fine black hair and matronly eyeglasses, and was clad in sweatpants and a hoodie that were different shades of gray. Once she’d adjusted the lectern’s flexible microphone to suit her modest height, she began to speak in the flat yet steely accent of a proud Kansan. “The death of my son has changed every iota of my being,” Lisa Finch said, reading from the speech she’d spent weeks writing by hand on ruled paper. “I am astonished by the transformation that has been brought to me. I have a different idea of myself. I have been basically forced to alter everything I do. I do not recognize the person I was before. That person is now a stranger from long ago.” Her heartfelt rumination soon segued into a stinging critique of Wichita’s police, whom she largely blames for what happened to her son. His death last December, in bizarre circumstances that made headlines around the world, turned Finch into an advocate for holding cops to account when they make fatal errors. Her scrappy campaign for justice has rattled her city, a place where the police are far more accustomed to being admired than scrutinized. As she spoke at length about her rage and anguish, Finch conspicuously failed to mention the nihilistic Angeleno who has been widely vilified for his role in her son’s death. She goes out of her way to avoid letting this young man’s name cross her lips, even though he has become a global symbol of all that’s rotten in gaming culture. She has never tried to learn about his extensive history of using the internet to sow real-world mayhem. All she knows is that his idea of a prank randomly smashed apart her family on a frigid winter night, and that she’s been adrift in a haze of grief ever since. Blinding white lights were trained on Finch as voices yelled at him from multiple angles to raise his hands. The man who called the Glendale, California, police department at 1:52 pm on September 30, 2015, said his name was Alex. In a quiet, almost childlike voice, he stated that he’d placed several backpacks containing bombs inside the news studio of KABC-TV, adjacent to Griffith Park. The bombs would be remotely detonated in 10 minutes. The studio was evacuated, and as K-9 units swept the premises the news team broadcast its afternoon show from the lawn outside the building. No explosives were found, which is why the response was more muted when an identical threat was phoned into the police nine days later: The bomb squad gave the studio a careful once-over, but the employees stayed at their desks. Detectives were initially stymied in their efforts to find “Alex.” His calls had come from a number with a Tennessee area code that traced back to a spoofed IP address. Then investigators received a crucial tip: A Cal State Northridge police officer reported that a friend of his, Wendy Gregory, had confided that her 22-year-old grandson was responsible for the ABC bomb threats. The man’s name was Tyler Barriss. A detective made arrangements to meet privately with Gregory, who had been the primary adult in the young man’s life. Barriss’ father had died in a car accident when Tyler was an infant, and his mother, Gregory’s daughter, had a long history of drug possession and prostitution charges. It had fallen on Gregory to raise Barriss, and he still lived with her in a tiny stucco home in the northwest Los Angeles neighborhood of Chatsworth. Gregory explained that her grandson, who was unemployed and spent most of his time playing online Halo matches on his Xbox 360, had said something odd to her while she’d been watching ABC’s local newscast a few weeks earlier: “Do you think I can clear out that building if I wanted to?” After learning of the first bomb threat, Gregory had confronted Barriss, who readily confessed to the crime. But he’d warned his grandmother not to snitch: If she did, he said, he’d beat her face into a bloody mess and then blow up their house. Gregory knew from experience that her volatile grandson might well make good on his promise. The police soon went to Gregory’s house to arrest Barriss, a tall and disconcertingly gaunt man with patchy facial hair and melancholy eyes. They also searched his bedroom, where they found an iPhone that contained some 40,000 messages. Examining them, detectives discovered evidence that Barriss was behind a nationwide wave of bomb threats. He had forced the evacuations of numerous high schools and colleges where his Halo friends were enrolled; his goal was to give them a day off class. But he’d also taken aim at more personal targets, such as the middle school for gifted students he’d once attended. Barriss gleefully boasted about his threats on Twitter, where he operated multiple accounts under variations of one of his gamer nicknames, Torture God. The messages also revealed that Barriss’ repertoire of mischief had recently expanded to include a type of hoax known as swatting: A malefactor calls emergency services and claims there’s a violent crisis at his target’s house; the aim is to trick the police into sending a heavily armed SWAT unit to the victim’s house so that its occupants will be both surprised and terrified. Deceitful internet enthusiasts have been swatting strangers and acquaintances for more than a decade, using VoIP providers and virtual private networks to make themselves difficult to catch. The FBI issued a dispatch about the crime’s rising popularity in February 2008, noting that “individuals did it for the bragging rights and ego, versus any monetary gain.” Why Police Should Monitor Social Media to Prevent Crime The Young and the Reckless Police Bodycams Can Be Hacked to Doctor Footage But the members of online communities where swatting is commonplace, such as certain hardcore gaming circles, consider that assessment too simplistic. Though they acknowledge that swatting is obnoxious, they also view it as a necessary form of frontier justice—a surefire way to stop vulgar “keyboard warriors” from slandering or threatening their online associates. “When you’re on the internet and your actions have little weight in real life, and then suddenly that translates into something as physically heavy as a swatting, it makes you realize the weight of your actions on a computer a lot more than you normally would,” says one former Call of Duty fanatic who has taken part in swattings. He maintains that his adversaries usually tempered their behavior after getting startled by a horde of cops: “It did reestablish boundaries on the internet for them and remind them that just because they were behind a computer talking shit, it didn’t mean they were untouchable.” Barriss himself was swatted by a fellow Halo player in February 2015, but the experience titillated rather than cowed him. “I remember hearing the helicopter hovering over our house for about five minutes before I realized it had to be a police chopper,” he tells me. “How cool would it be, I thought, if I could do that to anyone I wanted. It was just appealing to me, to be able to completely and anonymously own someone like that and not get caught.” Soon after that epiphany, he began to teach himself the skills necessary to swat his enemies. He wrote and revised call scripts, making each one more dramatic yet plausible than the last. He figured out how to obtain temporary phone numbers with area codes that wouldn’t make 911 operators suspicious. And he tried to scrub the internet of his personal information, so his victims would find it difficult to locate his home address and respond in kind. Barriss quickly became addicted to the thrill of swatting. “It was like a kind of online power,” he says. “Knowing that you’re breaking the law, and knowing that they won’t be able to find you, and knowing you just sent the SWAT team or bomb squad somewhere, and knowing you could do that over and over again.” He crowed to his grandmother about his achievements and described himself to her as a “hacking god.” But Barriss’ swatting career was interrupted by his arrest for the KABC-TV bomb threats. He pleaded no contest to two felony counts of making a false bomb report and was sentenced to two years and eight months in the Los Angeles County Jail. With credit for time served and good behavior, he was released on January 20, 2017. The next day, Barriss was arrested for illegally entering his grandmother Wendy’s house. According to police, Gregory lived in constant fear of her grandson and had taken out a protective order against him. Barriss pleaded no contest to violating that order and was sentenced to another 364 days in jail. When he finally went free again that August, after serving about half his term, he moved into a homeless shelter near Exposition Park in South Los Angeles as he waited for a Section 8 apartment to open up. The shelter is a 15-minute walk from a public library, which is where Barriss used the free computers to quietly resume his campaign of terror. He started with bomb threats again. Barriss had once harbored a vague aspiration to earn fame on the professional gaming scene as a Halo champion; now he sought to make a name for himself by tormenting gamers who’d attained celebrity. In early December 2017, he twice caused the evacuation of a major Call of Duty tournament at the Dallas Convention Center. When the social media star SoaR Ashtronova tweeted about the confusion she felt as she fled the event beneath the whir of police helicopters, Barriss taunted her from one of his Twitter accounts: “It got ran, baby girl. Thats what happens.” Six days later Barriss tweeted, “Gonna evacuate the net neutrality meeting guys don’t be upset.” That afternoon, the members of the Federal Communications Commission were compelled to scurry out of their Washington, DC, meeting room in response to a bomb threat, delaying a key vote on the future of net neutrality—an issue of vital importance to bandwidth-hungry gamers. Barriss took credit for the incident on Twitter and also marveled at the lack of any law enforcement response. “Where the cops at?” he wrote. “I’m too godly.” Barriss became addicted to the thrill of swatting. He loved having the power to transform police into playthings as if they were videogame characters. Barriss orchestrated swattings from the library too. His most high-profile victim was Lisa Vannatta, a Canadian gamer known as STPeach who livestreams to more than 770,000 followers on the video platform Twitch. On December 22, Barriss contacted the Calgary police and pretended that he’d shot his father and was holding his mother and brother hostage inside Vannatta’s apartment. The police surrounded the building with a squad of vehicles—a situation that Vannatta only became aware of after calling a pizza delivery man to check on her order and learning that he couldn’t get her pie through the cordon. Barriss ultimately deemed the swatting a disappointment because Vannatta shut down her Twitch stream before he could watch the cops burst into her apartment. (“Going off stream when I swat you @STPeachy ruining my clout,” he grumbled on Twitter.) Vannatta, meanwhile, was traumatized by the experience; she spent months agonizing over what she might have said or done to merit such hateful treatment. Barriss became so renowned for his swatting skill that he was able to parlay it into a business. If a client sent him an agreed-upon amount via PayPal—usually $10, but occasionally upwards of $50—Barriss would swat a victim of their choosing; for a price he would also call in bomb threats to schools, though he typically charged a 200 percent premium for that service. Demand swelled whenever he gained fresh notoriety by pulling off a major operation; the week after he twice evacuated the Dallas Convention Center, for example, he claims to have made more than $700. (His only other source of income was $220 a month in government benefits.) Though he took pleasure in profiting off his sinister craft, he got an even bigger kick out of showing people mercy on occasion: Instead of following through on a swatting, he’d sometimes tell a potential victim that he’d spare them just this once. For someone so on the skids in life, those brief moments of omnipotence were intoxicating. According to court records, on the afternoon of December 28, 2017, Barriss was at the library when he was contacted by an avid Call of Duty gamer named Casey Viner, known online as Baperizer. Ten days earlier, someone had hired Barriss to swat the 18-year-old Viner’s home outside of Cincinnati. Now Viner wanted Barriss to turn the tables and use his talents to punish a fellow gamer named Shane Gaskill. Viner explained that he and the 19-year-old Gaskill had been teammates in a four-versus-four Call of Duty match on a site that lets gamers compete for cash. Their team had lost the match and a $1.50 wager, in part because Gaskill had killed Viner’s character in a friendly fire incident. A bitter argument ensued, and Viner had sought out Barriss—whom he knew by the Twitter handle @SWAuTistic—to help him exact revenge. Barriss began to follow Gaskill on Twitter as he gathered the research necessary to carry out the swatting. But Gaskill noticed his new follower and immediately suspected his intentions. He sent Barriss a series of taunting direct messages: Please try some shit I’ll be waiting 1033 w McCormick st Wichita Kansas 67217 I’ll have you in prison for 5 years buddy Casey already gave me all the proof I need bahahahahah Hello pussy bitch say something Barriss knew just how to respond to such trash talk—with action rather than words. And since he’d now been personally insulted by Gaskill, he decided to do the swatting for free. “The death of my son has changed every iota of my being,” says Lisa Finch, who was at home with Andrew when he was shot by Wichita police. When Andrew Finch was in grade school in the early 2000s, he and his three siblings—Adrianne, Dominica, and Jerome—often stayed over at their grandmother’s trailer in eastern Wichita. Late one night when he was 11 years old, he picked up the trailer’s ringing phone and heard the slurred voice of one of his aunts; she was drunk at a bar on the other side of town and needed a ride home. Andy swiped the keys to his sleeping grandmother’s brand-new Dodge Neon and, despite being barely able to peer over the dashboard, drove across the sprawling city to fetch his aunt. His grandmother never found out what he had done, but it wasn’t out of character. The whole family knew that Andy could never resist the urge to try to protect those he loved. A year after Andy took his illicit jaunt in the Dodge Neon, Adrianne died in a car accident at the age of 20. Their mother, Lisa Finch, took over raising Adrianne’s two young children despite her own difficulties: She was a single mom of three, and she subsisted on disability payments due to a range of serious ailments, including diabetes, hypertension, and mental-health issues that stemmed from childhood abuse. Andy pitched in however he could, taking charge of the housework and serving as a father figure to his niece and nephew while also attending classes at Metro-Boulevard Alternative High School. (The children’s biological father had been deported to Mexico after serving a federal prison sentence.) But Andy, whom everyone called Snow because his lumpy physique resembled a snowman, lost his way after graduating in 2007. He studied air conditioner repair at a local technical college but dropped out due to boredom. His chief hobby was making elaborate pencil sketches of weeping angels and menacing cartoon characters, so his mother urged him to enroll in a computer-graphics program to capitalize on his artistic talent. But Andy ignored that advice and instead took a series of go-nowhere jobs fixing roofs and laying cement. At 20 he fathered a son, Aiden, with his on-again, off-again girlfriend; the new financial pressure spurred him to get into hustling on Wichita’s streets, where there was easy money to be made in the methamphetamine trade. Tyler Barriss, 25, lived with his grandmother in a modest stucco home in the northwest Los Angeles neighborhood of Chatsworth. It wasn’t long before Andy got into serious trouble with the law. One night in October 2012, he was on his way to a drug deal, gun in tow, when the police tried to pull him over for having the wrong registration tag on his Honda Accord. Andy panicked and sped off, leading to a high-speed chase that ended with the Honda submerged in a residential swimming pool. He eventually served a year in prison, during which time he came to realize that the encounter with the police might have saved his life: If the deal had gone down, there was a good chance it would have ended in gunfire. Andy was alarmed to think he’d come so close to abandoning his mother, who depended on him to help her eat right, take her medications, and care for her grandchildren. Andy pulled back from the streets after his prison stint, then left them for good when his girlfriend gave birth to his second child, Danica, in March 2016. He got a job cooking burgers at a Sonic Drive-In to provide for the two kids, who lived with their mother. In his free time he practiced tattooing friends, with an eye toward someday working in a tattoo shop. He also found comfort in faith for the first time, regularly attending services at a small brick church run by an ex–gang member who is also a Christian rapper. In early 2017, Andy and his mother went looking for a new house to rent. Andy’s favorite was a Victorian in a seedy neighborhood west of downtown. Lisa was put off by the fact that a flock of blackbirds had taken advantage of some broken windows to colonize the attic; the avian trespassers struck her as an ill omen. But Andy loved the old house and dreamed of building a firepit in the backyard, while Lisa liked that her grandchildren’s high school was just a five-minute walk away. That March, the Finches moved into 1033 West McCormick Street. Though it looked decrepit, the house stayed warm enough when the next winter hit in December. Three days after Christmas, the outside temperature dipped into the mid-20s after the early sunset. Wearing shorts and a gray hoodie, the 305-pound Andy splayed out on the living room couch to fiddle with his phone. His niece Adelina, who was 17, and his mother were relaxing in their bedrooms; two of their three other housemates were home too. At 6:27 pm, Andy thought he heard a noise outside. He knew the kids’ friends often drove through the alley on the west side of the house, and he got up to see who might be dropping by to visit. He couldn’t tell much by looking out the foyer’s narrow windows, however. So he opened the front door. Though the Wichita City Hall closes at 5 pm on weekdays, a civilian employee of the police department works the night shift to field whatever calls come into the building. The one he received at 6:10 pm on December 28 came from a soft-spoken man who he thought said something about his mother hitting his father with a gun. The employee tried to transfer the call to 911, but the connection got lost in the process. The caller, whose number bore a local 316 area code, rang City Hall again at 6:15 pm, and again the transfer to 911 failed. On the third try the call went through, and the 911 operator picked up at 6:18 pm. She asked the caller for his address. “Um, I’m at one, zero, thirty-three West McCormick Street,” the man replied. “I just shot my dad in the head. ’Cause he was arguing with my mom, and it was getting way out of control.” “Is that a house?” the operator asked. “Yeah, it’s a house. My mom and my brother are really scared right now, so I’m just pointing a gun at them and holding them in the closet right now.” “And what’s your name? What’s your name, hon?” “Ryan.” The caller went on to say that he hadn’t meant to kill his dad and that he was now thinking about lighting the house on fire and committing suicide. Seconds after he made that last statement, the line went dead. By 6:24 pm, several Wichita police officers were already on the scene—not members of the department’s SWAT unit or anyone trained in hostage negotiation, but rather patrolmen who’d been in the vicinity when the initial radio alert went out. No one informed them that the alleged hostage-taker had first contacted City Hall rather than 911, an irregularity that suggested something might be amiss. Two of the officers glanced up at a second-story window and saw what they thought was the silhouette of a person bobbing up and down; one of them remarked that it could be someone performing CPR. A pack of officers soon began to creep toward the front porch from the east; three of their colleagues positioned themselves directly across West McCormick Street, about 40 yards away, so they could provide cover fire if necessary. The cops’ hastily concocted plan was to make contact with the hostage-taker by using a public-address system. But before the sergeant with the PA could make his first announcement, the wooden front door to the house cracked open. Andy Finch emerged, pushed the exterior screen door ajar, and took a small step onto the porch. Blinding white lights were trained on Andy’s body as voices yelled at him from multiple angles to raise his hands. Andy did as he was told, but then he lowered at least one of his arms toward his waist—perhaps because he was instinctively recoiling from the sudden assault of light and sound, or perhaps because he was bewildered to find himself in a very different situation than what he could have possibly imagined. Andy’s inability to become a human statue amid disorienting circumstances sealed his fate. An officer named Justin Rapp, who was across the street and viewing the scene through his rifle’s nonmagnifying scope, made a snap judgment: The figure on the porch had to be reaching for a weapon. Rapp fired a .223 round that nicked the edge of the partially open screen door, then ripped through Andy’s chest, puncturing his heart and knocking him backward into the house. Adelina Finch rushed down the stairs to find her uncle bleeding on the foyer floor. As she tried to comprehend the surreal sight, the police stormed the home. They hustled her, Lisa, and their housemates out a side door to the sidewalk, where they were handcuffed and made to wait in the 24-degree chill as the police searched for the nonexistent family of “Ryan.” No one told them a thing about Andy’s condition. (The Wichita police refused to respond to multiple requests for comment about that night or its aftermath.) As the police tore through the house, flipping over dresser drawers and the plastic tubs that contained Lisa’s knickknacks, Tyler Barriss once again called the Wichita City Hall and asked to be connected to 911; he couldn’t dial the number direct from Los Angeles. Unaware that the swatting had already gone monstrously awry, Barriss told a slightly more detailed version of his story: He had shot his father in the head with a black handgun, and he was forcing his mother and little brother, Alex, to stay in a closet in their one-story house. “Yeah, I’m thinking about, um, ’cause I already poured gasoline all over the house, I might just set it on fire,” he said. When the information from the new 911 call was relayed to the officers at 1033 West McCormick Street, the gravity of their error began to dawn on them. There was no scent of gasoline; the house had two stories, not one; and the police hadn’t found a black handgun or any other weapon on the person of Andy Finch, who was declared dead at St. Francis Hospital at 7:03 pm. This video contains graphic language and footage showing a man being shot. Viewer discretion advised. Shane Gaskill, the gamer who allegedly dared Barriss to swat him, appeared to be in a triumphant mood when he messaged Barriss at 7:50 pm Central time, court records show. “This shit has me dying,” he wrote. “They showed up to my old house retard.” Gaskill and his family were former tenants at the West McCormick Street residence; they’d been evicted a year earlier and had moved to another part of town. Barriss scrambled to save face. “You gave an address that you dont live at but you were acting tough lol,” he replied. “So you’re a bitch.” Gaskill wasn’t fazed. “Anyways good job,” he wrote, “but you failed the mission because I trolled the fuck out of you guys.” Before signing off, he advised Barriss to delete a tweet he’d made on his @SWAuTistic account—a screenshot of the direct messages in which Gaskill had given him the wrong address. Barriss declined. Gaskill’s smugness didn’t last long. Over the next two hours, news of the fatal shooting on West McCormick Street—the first time a swatting had resulted in a death—spread across TV channels and social media nationwide. When Gaskill wrote back to Barriss at 9:51 pm, he was clearly in a panic: “Me you and Bape need to delete everything. This is a murder case now.” Instead of covering his tracks, Barriss tweeted out a nonchalant admission of what he had done: “That kid’s house I swatted is on the news.” Barriss was behind a nationwide wave of bomb threats targeting high schools attended by some of his fellow Halo players. His goal was to give them a day off class. When the online mob took to Twitter to shower @SWAuTistic with abuse, Barriss defended himself in all caps. “I DIDNT GET ANYONE KILLED BECAUSE I DIDNT DISCHARGE A WEAPON AND BEING A SWAT MEMBER ISNT MY PROFESSION,” he wrote. But his attempt to split hairs only inflamed his critics. “Imagine being 50 years old and having to live with yourself knowing you swatted and got someone killed cause you lost a videogame,” read one of the more poignant and less profane replies. The next day, as the story of Andy Finch’s death became a global sensation, Barriss sought out even more attention. He agreed to be interviewed on DramaAlert, a YouTube show with more than 4 million subscribers that normally shares gossip about internet celebrities like Jake Paul, RiceGum, and Lil Tay. During the audio-only interview, the show’s host, Daniel Keem, pressed Barriss to offer some sort of apology to the Finches, and he became increasingly frustrated as Barriss—who identified himself only as SWAuTistic—kept steering the conversation back to the “numerous people” who’d played roles in the catastrophe. “This whole situation’s just sad, dude,” Keem said as he moved to wrap up the call. “I can’t believe you’re not more remorseful.” “I am,” Barriss said. “The only thing I wasn’t going to take responsibility for was killing someone, because I didn’t kill anyone. Now I didn’t say that I have absolutely no responsibility in, uh, regarding this individual. Which admittedly I do, unfortunately. And it really sucks being connected to this incident in any fucking way. If I could rewind I would because this is all stupid.” Hours after his DramaAlert appearance, Barriss was arrested at the library near Exposition Park that had served as his de facto headquarters. He hadn’t been hard to locate: Wichita’s police had quickly found a tweet in which someone had outed @SWAuTistic as Barriss by posting a 2015 Los Angeles Times story about the KABC-TV bomb threats. Given the incident’s unprecedented nature, gamers felt no compunctions about breaking their tradition of omertà. Some people who’d been tracking Barriss’ malicious deeds questioned why he’d been allowed to act with impunity for so long. Barriss had been frank about his crimes as they’d escalated in frequency and ambition, but law enforcement had seemed in no rush to prevent him from weaponizing the country’s emergency services with fake information. One Twitter user said he’d alerted the Dallas police to Barriss’ activities on December 10, right after the second bomb threat at the Call of Duty tournament. “@DallasPD ignored this and 2 weeks later this same person swatted someone and a father was murdered,” he wrote. “This death could have been prevented on so many levels.” (A Dallas police spokesperson says the incident was turned over to the FBI but declined to say when that occurred.) As she awaited questioning at the police station downtown, where she, Adelina, and her two housemates had been taken, Lisa Finch was desperate to know what had become of Andy. She hadn’t seen him bleeding in the foyer—the police had led her straight from her first-floor bedroom to the side door—so she was still hoping for the best. When the detective in charge of her interrogation finally entered the room where she was being held, she blurted out a simple question: “What about my son?” When the detective told her that Andy had died, Lisa’s reaction was an eerie sense of calm. Now I have a mission, she thought, to bring as much trouble as I can to the Wichita Police Department. A few days later, amid the mess the police had left behind at 1033 West McCormick Street, Lisa heard a knock at the house’s side door. The visitor was Gordon Ramsay, Wichita’s chief of police, who had come wearing civilian clothes. He and Lisa sat opposite one another in the ransacked living room. Ramsay offered his condolences and gave Lisa a business card with his personal phone number written down the side. Then he asked whether she’d like to join him in watching the officers’ bodycam videos of Andy’s final moments. Lisa was gobsmacked by the tone deafness of the chief’s offer: Why would I want to watch the footage of my son being shot by a cop, with a cop? A friend of Lisa’s soon put her in touch with a prominent Chicago attorney, Andrew Stroth, who was keen to help her take on the WPD. Stroth had recently ditched a lucrative career in sports and entertainment law—his clients had included elite athletes such as Dwyane Wade and Michael Vick—to build a new firm dedicated to representing victims of police brutality. He primarily works with African American families whose stories rarely receive much attention, even in their own towns; the death of the white Andy Finch, by contrast, was front and center on every cable news network. But Stroth was disturbed by the apparent egregiousness of the Wichita Police Department’s conduct—particularly the fact that the unarmed Andy had been shot in his home—and he agreed to take Lisa’s case and file a civil-rights lawsuit against the city. As Stroth pieced together the complaint, which he would eventually file in late January, prosecutors in Wichita were figuring out what to do about Tyler Barriss, whom they had extradited to Kansas. Marc Bennett, the district attorney for Sedgwick County, considered prosecuting Barriss for felony murder, since Andy had been killed during the commission of another crime. But after much deliberation he ultimately settled on involuntary manslaughter as the most fitting charge. The homicide indictment did little to assuage either Lisa or her growing legion of supporters in Wichita, who couldn’t fathom why there’d been no repercussions for the police officers involved in the shooting. Wichita police have long been viewed with suspicion by the city’s communities of color, who believe they are policed with a much heavier hand than their white counterparts. The city is 76 percent white, but of the 17 people reportedly killed in police shootings in the city since 2010, seven of them, or 41 percent, have been black or Hispanic. Andy’s death, however, disquieted people who hadn’t previously thought ill of law enforcement. “A lot of white people in Wichita, you have these police shootings where there’s a black victim and—I’m just being honest here—they think ‘Oh, well, they probably deserved it for some reason,’ ” says Levi Henry, a Wichita political consultant who works with progressive candidates and campaigns. “But here there’s a white father, and for a lot of white people in Wichita—white dads—they’re like, ‘That could be me.’ ” The signs of popular discontent were small at first: “Justice for Andrew Finch” flyers, illustrated with a clenched fist, taped to lampposts downtown, or a Facebook group that directed members to email local politicians. But by February, citizens in "Arrest WPD officer Justin Rapp" T-shirts were becoming fixtures at the City Council’s weekly meetings. With Lisa usually looking on from the front row of the chambers, the activists used the council’s open-microphone policy to express their anguish. “We are scared of those who are supposed to protect us. We are angry that our questions are being ignored,” a resident named Kathy Camden said at the February 6 meeting, calling for Ramsay’s resignation and the prosecution of Rapp. “We are sickened by the hypocrisy of those we hold to a higher standard not being held responsible for their own actions. We are demanding justice, demanding it for Andrew.” In March, Lisa’s supporters considered demonstrating outside the arena that was hosting first- and second-round games of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. But they worried that potential allies might be turned off by the confrontational optics of a street protest, especially one that interfered with a beloved sport. (“I mean, it’s still Kansas,” notes one close ally of the Finch family.) They instead got their point across by renting four electronic billboards, which they programmed to greet basketball fans with a stark message in red and black LEDs: "Andy Finch is dead. If you believe in justice, it's time to file charges." Despite the public pressure, DA Bennett announced on April 12 that he wouldn’t prosecute Rapp. “This shooting should not have happened,” he wrote in a 42-page report on the case. “But this officer’s decision was made in the context of the false call. To charge [Rapp] would require evidence—not 20/20 hindsight—that it was unreasonable for him to believe in that moment that the man who came to the door posed a risk to the officers near the house … There is insufficient evidence to overcome self-defense immunity under Kansas law.” Lisa tried to resume her sermon. She found, however, that her microphone had been cut—a last-ditch effort to get her to sit down. She kept talking anyway. Distraught by Bennett’s decision, Lisa spent the next five days polishing a speech she intended to deliver at the April 17 City Council meeting—the meeting where she came to the lectern dressed in a gray hoodie, a sweatshirt very much like the one Andy had worn on the night of his death. Once she started speaking that morning, she had no intention of sticking to her time limit. After her philosophical preamble about the transformative nature of grief, Lisa pivoted to picking apart Bennett’s report. She noted, for example, that Rapp’s partner had stated that he thought Andy was trying to retreat into the house—not reach for a weapon—when he lowered his arms. “What was the reason to shoot?” she asked. “How was anyone able to think about anything, especially Andy?” At that point, Wichita mayor Jeff Longwell tried to intervene. “Lisa, can you wrap it up right quick?” he said from his seat at the center of the council’s dais. “You’ve gone over five minutes.” Lisa paused for a beat as she absorbed the mayor’s dismissive words. “My time has been taken away from me, sir,” she growled back. “I have no time, no leisure time, no time to enjoy anything. This is my time.” And on she went with her speech, lambasting Rapp for being too quick to pull the trigger, questioning why it had never occurred to the police that Andy might be a hostage being used as a human shield, and meditating on the government’s constitutional obligations to its citizens. (“The concept of due process goes back to 1215 AD, to clause 39 of the Magna Carta …”) Her thoughts were often jumbled or repetitive, but such messiness is perhaps to be expected of someone trying to talk her way toward catharsis after losing a child. At the 21-minute mark, Mayor Longwell again tried to coax Lisa away from the lectern, offering her face-to-face time in his office if she would yield the floor. Lisa turned to her supporters in the audience: “Do you think I need to wrap it up?” “Hell no!” they shouted, and Lisa tried to resume her sermon. She found, however, that her microphone had been cut—a last-ditch effort to get her to sit down. But she kept on talking for another five minutes, even though her words were barely audible. Once Lisa was finished, four of her supporters took turns at the lectern. All simmered with anger over what they characterized as the municipal government’s indifference to their grievances. “We hear nothing from you—no comments, not even a kind word to the victim’s mother, who is also a victim,” one activist said. “We can barely get you to look up from your computers and your phones to give us the attention we deserve.” When offered the chance to respond, the city manager stated that the police department was in the midst of reviewing its policies and training methods. Mayor Longwell then tried to end the discussion, telling the restive audience, “We’ve always said we appreciate participation.” Lisa and her supporters rose in unison to walk out of the meeting. When they were nearly to the door, Brandon Johnson—the only African American member of the City Council—called out: “Ms. Finch?” Lisa stopped to listen. “I just wanted to acknowledge you and extend my sympathies to you,” Johnson said. “I know that my words may not mean a whole lot, but I wanted to acknowledge you and thank you for your courage and your strength to continue to fight for change.” For the first time that day, the activists applauded for someone other than their own. Andrew Finch, who died at 28, got into trouble with the law as a young man but pulled back from the streets after the birth of his second child. He worked as a cook at a Sonic Drive-In. On May 22, Tyler Barriss appeared in Sedgwick County District Court for the preliminary hearing in his manslaughter case. He wore an oversize gray suit that made him seem even more cartoonishly slender than usual. His frail appearance conveyed no hint of the defiant swagger he’d expressed on April 6, when he’d gotten access to a jail computer and exploited a Windows 10 vulnerability to connect to the internet for three hours. “How am I on the internet if I’m in jail?” he’d written on his @GoredTutor36 Twitter account. “Because I’m an eGod, that’s how. All right, now who was talking shit? Your ass is about to get swatted.” The surprise of the hearing came when officer Justin Rapp took the stand. He stated that he had never actually seen a weapon in Andy Finch’s hand—he had just thought that Andy was reaching into his waistband for a gun, and so he’d fired to protect his fellow officers. That admission seemed to contradict what appears in Bennett’s 42-page report. (“I believe that I see a, a gun in his hand,” the report quotes Rapp—identified as Officer #1—as saying.) Rapp also testified in court that he’d never heard of swatting before that fateful night on West McCormick Street. On the same day as the preliminary hearing in state court, a federal grand jury in the District of Kansas indicted Barriss, Casey Viner, and Shane Gaskill for an array of crimes including cyberstalking (Barriss only), wire fraud (Barriss, Viner, and Gaskill). Then, on May 24, federal prosecutors in Washington announced that Barriss had been charged with phoning in bomb threats to both the FCC and the FBI in December 2017. In late September, Barriss was transferred into the custody of the US Marshals, who moved him to a detention center in Newton, Kansas, about 25 miles outside Wichita. It was there that Barriss learned that he would have to face a third federal case: On October 24, prosecutors in the Central District of California charged him for many of the bomb threats and swattings he’d allegedly carried out in 2015 and 2017. Barriss’ federal public defender has requested that this case be transferred to the District of Kansas, a move that would require Barriss to plead guilty to the California charges. With plea negotiations apparently underway on the federal level, the state manslaughter case could be delayed or even dismissed.1 Bennett, who is overseeing Barriss’ prosecution in Wichita, describes the case as grim for all the parties involved: “There are no happy outcomes here for anyone,” he says. But he also believes the death of Andy Finch is an important cautionary tale that has already made American police officers more wary of being hoaxed. He points to a January swatting in Overland Park, Kansas, during which the cops kept a safe distance from the victim’s house until they could establish contact with the people inside and sort out the facts. An Overland Park police spokesperson later said that the officers took such a careful approach because the Wichita incident “was in the back of our mind.” Authorities nationwide are now intent on reducing not only the potential lethality of swattings but also their volume. The aggressive prosecution of Barriss seems designed to deter others who might be tempted to seek swatting’s buzz of power—a stratagem that has made Barriss fatalistic about his future. “Well, a life sentence is dangling over my head,” he wrote to me in one of eight letters from jail. “But assuming I get out, I’m just going to try and live a modest, normal life.” Forging a Relationship With the Internet’s Most Hated Swatter Lisa doesn’t much care what happens to Barriss. “This person, I don’t want to know him, I don’t want to understand him,” she says. “Have you ever seen pictures of his eyes? There’s no light there, no shine there, there’s nothing there. I would liken it to darkness.” But not everyone in the Finch family is so committed to shunning Barriss. In January, Andy’s devout younger brother, Jerome, felt compelled to write to Barriss in jail. “The letter was an invitation to let the Lord Jesus Christ into the situation, to bring grace and to begin the process of healing,” Jerome says. “And even for that grace to extend to Tyler, because he’s going through a lot too.” When Barriss responded, he expressed what seemed to be a grudging sliver of remorse: “I cannot say that I don’t feel a level of guilt for what happened to your brother.” But he also tried to argue that he’d been powerless to resist Gaskill’s goading. “A kid on Twitter was claiming to live at 1033 W. McCormick and was begging to be swatted,” he wrote. “I mean BEGGING.” Reminding friends to vote on Election Day used to be the extent of Lisa’s political involvement. But she now finds it therapeutic to engage in other ways. In February, for example, she went to Topeka to testify before the state legislature, which passed a bill—the Andrew T. Finch Act—that toughens the penalties for swatting; it stipulates a maximum sentence of 41 years in prison. (Governor Jeff Colyer signed the bill into law in April.) But it is the police, not swatters, who are the primary focus of Lisa’s activism. She still keeps tabs on the weekly City Council meetings, where her supporters continue to agitate on her behalf. In June a close friend of hers recited the lyrics to N.W.A’s hip hop classic “Fuck Tha Police” in front of Mayor Longwell and the council before leading a walkout. And in May, Lisa drove 1,200 miles to Washington to speak at a Capitol Hill rally against police violence. She did so alongside other mothers whose children were killed by cops—a group of women who refer to themselves as “sisters in a sorority we never wanted to pledge.” Lisa was deeply moved by the experience. “The people that I’ve met, I hate the circumstances that we’ve met under,” she told the crowd that had assembled in the shadow of the Capitol’s dome. “But you. Are. Family. Because nobody else understands what we’re going through.” There are days, however, when Lisa wakes up so dejected that she can barely move. In her gloomiest moments, she becomes overwhelmed by the incomprehensibility of the events that collided to doom her eldest son. “My daughter died in a car wreck,” she says. “And that’s—‘acceptable’ is not the word, ‘normal’ is not the word. But people die in car accidents all the time. But how Andy went out …” She has yet to figure out a satisfactory way to complete that sentence. But when her mood brightens, Lisa revels in discussing all the things she still wants to do to ensure that Andy didn’t die in vain. She has vague and fanciful designs, for example, on working to pass federal legislation that will somehow increase police accountability and transparency. And she dreams of winning more than just money in her federal civil-rights lawsuit: She also wants the city’s downtown park, Riverside Park, to be renamed in Andy’s honor, and for its centerpiece to be a memorial with an inscription that reads: “Donated by the Wichita Police Department.” Contributing editor Brendan I.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Authorities believe alleged gunman Robert Bowers acted alone and was driven by his hatred of Jews; David Lee Miller reports from Pittsburg on what more is being learned about the suspect. The victims of the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh included a grandfather, a husband and wife, and two brothers, officials and family members revealed as new details about the alleged gunman behind the deadly rampage were released Sunday. The Tree of Live victims were identified as Joyce Fienberg, 75, of Oakland; Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township; Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill; David Rosenthal, 54, of Squirrel Hill; Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg; Sylvan Simon, 87, of Wilkinsburg; Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill; Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill; and Irving Younger, 69, of Mount Washington. President Trump ordered flags at federal locations throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. In a proclamation, Trump declared: “I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, October 31, 2018. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.” U.S. Attorney Scott Brady called the massacre an “unspeakable and hateful crime" during a news conference, adding that alleged gunman Robert Gregory Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people during the shooting rampage. A gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing multiple people. Here’s what you need to know about the tragedy. One of the first victims to be identified by family members was 71-year-old Dan Stein, who once served as the president of the New Light Congregation, which holds services at the Tree of Life Synagogue where the shooting took place. “He was very active and he did everything,” Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “He was there every Saturday for services.” Stein recently became a grandfather and was remembered as someone always willing to help others. Daniel Stein, 71, was among those killed in the massacre.

Bernice and Sylvan Simon were married and were also among the dead in the rampage, he added. A friend of Melvin Wax told the Associated Press that the retired accountant was a "sweet, sweet guy," and a pillar of the New Light Congregation that rented space on the lower level of the synagogue. "He was such a kind, kind person," Myron Snider, chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee, told the AP. "When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them.

But most of the time." Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," said Snider, a retired pharmacist. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person."

((Andrew Stein/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP) Jerry Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician, was known for his uplifting demeanor, according to former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus. In an email sent to his former coworkers on Sunday, Claus passed along his condolences to Rabinowitz's family, saying "he was truly a trusted confidant and healer." The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a retired nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning and sustained critical injuries to his chest, he said. Daniel Leger was seriously injured in the shooting. (Facebook) “I don’t think it really quite struck home," Paul Leger told the Tribune-Review. "This is something like on TV.” Pittsburgh police said in an arrest affidavit made public early Sunday that Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. Bowers was being treated for his injuries when he said Jews were "committing genocide to his people," and that he wanted them all to die. Bowers walked into the synagogue during Sabbath services on Saturday morning armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns before opening fire, killing 11 people and wounding six. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. WHO IS ROBERT BOWERS?

Puskar)) Robert Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said it may take up to a week to process the crime scene. Bowers has an initial appearance in federal court scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Monday. "This was a large, complex crime scene and much work remains to be done," he said at a news conference. A search of Bowers' home in Baldwin has been conducted, but officials have not disclosed what was discovered inside. There is also nothing to indicate that Bowers had any accomplices, he added. "We don’t know why he picked this synagogue," Jones said. Former FBI special agent Maureen O’Connell weighs in. The attack took place just before 10 a.m. in the residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Peter Hart, who has lived a few blocks from the synagogue for just over three decades, told Fox News on Saturday said it's "a very tight community," and the rampage was "a shock." "It’s not that Pittsburgh has no crime, it’s not that, but among the safest neighborhoods is the neighborhood that this happened in," Hart told Fox News.

Tobias, Newark Advocate, via USA TODAY Network) On Saturday, a Pennsylvania man was accused of shooting 11 people to death at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in what is being considered the worst attack on Jews at worship in American history. Before the attack, the suspected gunman posted a message on Gab, a fringe social media network launched in 2016. His use of Gab has thrust the service into the spotlight. Here's what you need to know about Gab: Gab was launched in 2016 as an alternative to traditional platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. During that time, Twitter had suspended several accounts associated with the "alt-right" movement on the same day it vowed a crackdown on hate speech. The suspensions pushed many people to Gab, which has fewer restrictions on what content users can post compared with Twitter and other social media. "Gab’s mission is to put people and free speech first," the service's guidelines say. "We believe that the only valid form of censorship is an individual’s own choice to opt-out." The relaxed rules opened the door for content such as anti-Semitic posts and conspiracy theories. In August, according to The Verge, Microsoft threatened to stop hosting the social network over a pair of anti-Semitic posts, which eventually were removed. Gab's rules say it prohibits activities such as posting illegal pornography, engaging in any illegal activity using Gab, or "calling for the acts of violence against others, promoting or engaging in self-harm, and/or acts of cruelty, threatening language or behavior that clearly, directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user or individual(s)." Before entering the synagogue, an account appearing to belong to suspect Robert Bowers, 46, posted a message on Gab: "I can't sit by an watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I'm going in." His profile also featured multiple anti-Semitic comments and conspiracy theories, including one referenced in his last post claiming the organization HIAS, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was bringing "invaders in to kill our people." More: Who is Robert Bowers? Accused Pittsburgh synagogue shooter left anti-semitic trail In a statement, Gab said it was "saddened and disgusted" by the Pittsburgh attack. "Gab took swift and proactive action to contact law enforcement immediately," the service said in a statement. "We first backed up all user data from the account and then proceeded to suspend the account." PayPal spokesman Justin Higgs said the payments service canceled Gab's account and had been in the process of ending its account before the shooting. "The company is diligent in performing reviews and taking account actions," Higgs said. "When a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action." On Twitter, Gab said payment processing service Stripe and hosting provider Joyent were going to ban the service. Representatives from Joyent could not be immediately reached for comment. In a statement, Stripe said the company can’t comment on individual users for privacy reasons. BREAKING: @stripe is likely going to ban us. We gave them plenty of documented and detailed evidence.

For this, we have been no-platformed from:@stripe@paypal@joyent In a matter of hours. This is direct collusion between big tech giants. @realDonaldTrump ACT! In a statement, Gab said the behavior from Bowers and other users isn't unique to its service. "Criminals and criminal behavior exist on every social media platform."

(Photo: NEIL STREBIG, York Daily Record via USA TODAY Network) The man accused of killing 11 people in a shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue was armed with an arsenal of weapons and a virulent hatred for the unsuspecting targets who had gathered to worship in the heart of the local Jewish community. Court documents provide glimpses of suspect Robert Bowers and the 20 minutes of bloodshed Saturday at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the city's affluent Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Mayor Bill Peduto, at a news conference Sunday, promised that the city would emerge stronger from its "darkest day." "We are a resilient city," Peduto said. "We have been knocked down before, but we have always been able to stand back up because we work together." More: These are the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre More: What we know now: Pittsburgh synagogue massacre Bowers, 46, allegedly burst into the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the affluent Squirrel Hill neighborhood, shouting anti-Semitic epithets as he opened fire on the congregants. His extensive armaments included a Colt AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and three Glock .357 handguns. At least three of the weapons were purchased legally, the Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed law enforcement official. The gunshots pierced Saturday morning quiet in the neighborhood on the city's east side. Marcy Pepper, a member of the synagogue until this year, told USA TODAY she heard the gunshots from her home. “How do you walk in there again, and walk by that spot?” Pepper said. E. Joseph Charney, a member of the synagogue since 1955, was in the synagogue waiting for the morning service when he heard a loud noise downstairs. A man entered the doorway, then Charney heard gunshots. “I looked up and there were all these dead bodies,” Charny, 90, told The Washington Post. “I wasn’t in the mood to stay there.” Charney fled, hiding with others in a storage room full of boxes. A short time later he slipped out of the synagogue to safety. “At first I felt numb, then thankful,” he told the Post. “I don’t need to tell you how terrible this has all been.” Bowers shot and killed 11 worshippers and wounded two others before being confronted by police, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said. Four officers were injured, including three shot by Bowers, Brady said. More: A people raised in violence had found peace in Squirrel Hill More: Suspect charged with 29 counts in synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh The criminal complaint says Bowers made statements "evincing an animus towards people of the Jewish faith." Bowers told one law enforcement officer, in substance, that "they're committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews," according to the complaint. Bowers repeated comments regarding genocide, his desire to kill Jewish people, and that Jewish people needed to die, the complaint adds. Federal authorities have said that police engaged the suspect as he attempted to flee the synagogue, driving Bowers back inside. The suspected gunman ultimately surrendered to officers after he was wounded multiple times, authorities said. “The officers prevented additional loss of life,” FBI Special Agent Bob Jones said. Bowers had been posting anti-Semitic rants on social media. Minutes before entering the building, he apparently posted to Gab, a fringe website favored by white nationalists. "I can't sit by an watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I'm going in," the post said. Bowers was charged with 29 criminal counts, including 11 federal hate-crime charges. Eleven counts of using a firearm to kill carry a maximum penalty of death, though no decision had been made about the death penalty would be sought. He is scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate Monday. The Anti-Defamation League called Saturday's attack the deadliest against the Jewish community in U.S. history. The attack prompted increased security, including a police presence, at synagogues across the nation. Peduto, however, brushed off comments from President Trump that armed guards at the Tree of Life would have prevented the carnage. "The approach we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those who are looking to express hatred through murder," Peduto said. The names of the victims, who ranged in age from 54 to 97, were released Sunday: Joyce Fienberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, brothers Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54; Bernice Simon, 84, and her husband Sylvan Simon, 86, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69. Rabinowitz was a physician who worked at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, where some of the wounded were taken after the attack. "The UPMC family... cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz," the hospital said on a Twitter post. "Jerry was above all one of the kindest physicians and human beings in our community." Karl Williams, chief medical examiner for Allegheny County, said he had notified the families of all the victims. "The families are in shock and grieving, please be respectful of their needs, their time and space as they deal with this tragedy," Williams told the media. Police Chief Scott Schubert said one officer was treated for his injuries and released Saturday. Another was expected to be released from the hospital today. UPMC said one officer remained hospitalized in critical condition. Schubert lauded his officers for running into the danger, and he issued condolences to families of the victims. "We have a strong relationship with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh," Schubert said. "I just want to say that we grieve with you." Contributing: Ryan Miller, USA TODAY.

A Pittsburgh Steelers logo with one of the hypocycloids changed to a Star of David, on a banner at Heinz Field for Sunday's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) One man created a special twist on the Pittsburgh Steelers logo after a mass shooting unfolded at a synagogue in the Steel City. Tim Hindes, a full-time graphic designer and marketer, told Fox News: "I wanted it to be a symbol of remembrance, but more so, to be a message of hope. That we're together." Hindes called the creation of the logo -- which includes the Star of David -- his "proudest moment to date." He also shared the story behind the design in a lengthy Facebook post. Hindes said he helped some friends move into their home before he looked on his phone — and saw there had been a shooting “at a synagogue a mile away from where we were packing.” “My heart sunk,” he admitted. “Unfortunately, it wasn't because of the shooting, but because (I had feared) it was fueled by hate.” Hindes explained that one of his friends recently had been the target of anti-Semitic verbal abuse. “I had been disturbed by these events all week long and it seemed that I was seeing these same remarks now being played out in horrific fashion in front of me,” he wrote. At one point, he said, he started to doodle. PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING VICTIMS IDENTIFIED AS BROTHERS, HUSBAND AND WIFE KILLED IN 'UNSPEAKABLE AND HATEFUL CRIME' “Before it was the logo of a globally popular football team, the three diamonds were the seal of a product which helped develop the foundation of many cities across the globe--steel,” Hindes wrote. “Like Pittsburgh and its residents, steel is strong. It was a perfect basis for an image of hope.” He added that it “was natural” for his take on the logo to feature the six-pointed star. “The Jewish community is a thread throughout Pittsburgh's foundation and an important and diverse part of my fantastic city,” he shared. Hindes also wrote about the strength of Pittsburgh’s residents, who he said “don’t get rattled easily.” PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE SUSPECT TOLD OFFICERS 'I JUST WANT TO KILL JEWS,' AFFIDAVIT SAYS “This fortitude was instilled in our community by our pierogi-pinching grandmothers,” he said. “We were strong before this tragedy. A tragedy like this just makes us stronger. Just like you can't break steel, you can't break the resiliency of a Pittsburgher. We are stronger than hate.” Hindes concluded the post by saying he's praying for those killed, along with their families and the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. “I hope this small symbol demonstrates that you are not alone in your mourning and that we all love you,” he wrote.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  In the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a synagogue in his city that left 11 people dead and six others wounded, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto balked at President Trump’s statement that the massacre could have been prevented if the house of worship had employed an armed guard. “I don’t think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or our schools filled with armed guards,” Peduto said during an appearance on NBC News’ “Meet The Press.” Peduto added: “I think we’re dealing with an irrational person who acted irrationally and trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern. We should try to stop irrational behavior from happening at the forefront and not try to create laws around irrational behavior.” The Pittsburgh mayor’s comments come a day after the president's remarks, in regards to the mass shooting, that gun control "has little to do with it," but added "if they had protection inside, the results would have been far better." "This is a case where, if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately," Trump said. "Maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him, frankly. So it's a very, very -- a very difficult situation." Saturday’s mass shooting has reignited the debate over gun control in the final weeks before the midterm elections. In previous mass shootings, Trump has at times said he would consider tightening gun laws but overall has called for more armed guards in places such as schools. "The world is a violent world," Trump said before a campaign trail speech in Illinois. "And you think when you're over it, it just sort of goes away, but then it comes back in the form of a madman, a wacko. ... They had a maniac walk in and they didn't have any protection and that is just so sad to see, so sad to see." The president on Saturday evening also announced that he will travel to Pittsburgh soon. Trump called the shooting "an assault on humanity," and asked Americans to "unite to conquer hate." In a pair of tweets, Trump said, "All of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries." "This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate." The Associated Press contributued to this report.

The gathering included prayers and singing in memory of those killed and wounded.(Oct. 27) AP The flag flies half-staff at Heinz Field before the Pittsburgh-Cleveland game to recognize the 11 people shot and killed in Tree of life synagogue. (Photo: Philip G. Pavely, USA TODAY Sports) PITTSBURGH – Steelers fans packed into the lots surrounding Heinz Field, tailgated – tossing footballs back and forth, consuming savory foods and cold beers – and then filed into the stadium, clad in black and gold, just like they would any other day. They waved their terrible towels as players took the field during pregame introductions. A few pink breast cancer awareness towels littered the fray. A handful of fans held signs. “Just married,” read one. “This sign has as many Super Bowls as the Browns,” read another. “It’s my birthday,” read a third. But not until the stadium announcer called for a moment of silence before the national anthem to honor the victims of the shooting at a synagogue in nearby Squirrel Hill did anything suggest the day was different for the Steelers and their fans. On Saturday, a gunman killed 11 people and injured six more in the attack. Players and fans bowed their heads and stood in silence for seven seconds before the game against the Browns. Many people throughout the Pittsburgh area — including family members, friends and members of the synagogue — have replaced their Facebook profile photos with a Stronger Than Hate graphic, a play on the Steelers' logo. In the reworked version, the top-most of three four-pointed stars is replaced by the six-pointed Star of David. Sunday morning, Steelers team president Art Rooney II issued a statement Sunday morning which read, "On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our support and condolences to the families of the attack on peaceful citizens worshiping at The Tree of Life Synagogue. Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community. With that in mind we will ask everyone to join in a moment of silence and prayer prior to our game this afternoon.” Asked if the tragedy would put a damper on the day, McKeesport, Pa., resident Jim Kumf told USA TODAY Sports before entering the stadium, “I hope not. We’ll be fine. This is happening all the time. You hate to say you’re getting used to it, but it really is happening everywhere unfortunately.” Steelers wide receiver Ryan Switzer, who wore a shirt that said "love thy neighbor" that included several denominations, said after his team's 33-18 win Sunday he had been waiting for a time to wear the shirt to express the message.

(Oct. 28) AP Pittsburgh Steelers logo with Star of David at game between the Steelers and the Cleveland Browns, Oct. 28, 2018, Pittsburgh. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) I was sitting at Shabbat services at my synagogue, Congregation Beth Israel in Charlottesville, Virginia, when a fellow congregant whispered in my ear that there had been a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. My heart sank. As the day unfolded, and the scope of the tragedy at Tree of Life synagogue came into focus, like all Jews and most Americans, I felt a flood of emotions come over me — sadness, worry, frustration and anger. Mostly frustration and anger. How could this keep happening over and over again? I am the president of the only synagogue in Charlottesville, where just more than a year ago neo-Nazis marched through the University of Virginia chanting “Jews will not replace us,” and where the next day they rioted in our streets only a block from our temple, killing one person and wounding dozens more. Since then, we have had no choice but to be vigilant and prepared. The co-chair of our Security Committee, who was also at services Saturday, immediately stepped outside to speak with the armed security guard — a fixture at our synagogue for the past 15 months — to let him know what had happened and ask him to be on high alert. And at the end of Shabbat services, which included a bar mitzvah, our two rabbis and other senior staff and congregation leaders planned our response: extra armed security for our religious school Sunday morning, asking the Charlottesville Police Department for additional patrols around the temple, drafting a letter to notify our congregants of what we were doing to ensure their and their children’s safety and, perhaps most important, scheduling a prayer service for us to comfort one another and express solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters in Pittsburgh. When I stood on the steps of my synagogue just over a year ago on another Shabbat morning and watched as neo-Nazis marched by, most of them armed, some with pistols, some with rifles, some of them carrying swastika flags, and some of them shouting “heil Hitler” and other anti-Semitic slogans, it was surreal. I was not surprised by the knowledge that there is anti-Semitism in America — I’m not naive — but that it could be displayed so brazenly and even proudly in the streets of an American city was frankly shocking. More: This time shooting hits a synagogue in Pittsburgh Five lessons of Charlottesville one year later: ADL director Veteran: Unite the Right white supremacists violate every principle I defended in uniform I’d like to say that I am, again, shocked at the violence now perpetrated against Jews in Pittsburgh, but I am not. Given what I saw in the streets here, it now seems that it was an inevitable tragedy, a straight line from the events in our small town in August 2017; to President Donald Trump's assertion of “very fine people on both sides”; to the demonization of George Soros and other, so-called and unnamed “globalists” with the use of time-worn anti-Semitic conspiratorial tropes that they are secretly pulling strings to undermine the standing of white culture; to Saturday’s horror. Despite all that, based on our experience here in Charlottesville, there will be another side to this story as well, one that will unfold for the Jewish community of Pittsburgh over the coming weeks, months and years as they struggle to cope with their profound grief and find their way toward some semblance of healing. It will occur in relative obscurity, after the news trucks and reporters have left. Given the magnitude of Saturday’s loss, empty spaces will, of course, always remain in the hearts of the Pittsburgh Jewish community. But if their experience is anything like ours, they will also see that millions of Jews around the world are standing in solidarity with them, ready to help them with anything they might need, and they will feel the warmth and strength of what it means to be a part of that worldwide community and the unbreakable bonds that connect us to one another. If their experience is anything like ours, they will see their local neighbors, people of all religions, of all races and of all nationalities, stand with and hold them close to protect them, because as Americans and as human beings they share the grief and pain of the Jewish community in their midst. And if their experience is anything like ours, they will, ultimately, find their way to a future based on the knowledge that our people and our religion have endured for more than 3,000 years, grounded not in fear, frustration and anger, but in the living expression and practice of our eternal and immutable shared values of compassion, decency, tolerance, humility, lovingkindness and justice.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-patrols-synagogues-20181027-story.html---split---Los Angeles police increased patrols around synagogues and other places of worship Saturday in the wake of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We are monitoring the situation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania very closely and communicating with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners,” the LAPD tweeted. “Right now there is no apparent connection to Los Angeles.” “However, out of an abundance of caution you will see extra patrols around houses of worship today. Remember if you see something...say something.” Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted a similar message of caution, saying “we are reaching out to Jewish community leaders. We mourn with #TreeOfLife community today.” Authorities in Pittsburgh said there were 11 fatalities in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the center of the city’s Jewish community. Four police officers were also shot. The suspected gunman was in custody and identified as Robert Bowers, 46, law enforcement officials said. The incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters. A law enforcement official told CNN that the shooter made anti-Jewish comments during the incident. Amanda Susskind, Los Angeles regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said anti-Semitic incidents were up by 57% nationwide in 2016-17. Still, she said the shooting surprised her. “It never stops being shocking and horrifying when something like this happens,” she said. Speaking to reporters, President Trump suggested that if the synagogue had had armed protection, “maybe it could have been a very much different situation." Susskind said security can be helpful but isn’t the only way to protect places of worship from harm. "Frankly, if someone is coming in with guns blazing, it’s hard to say whether that would make a difference,” she said. “Synagogues struggle with balancing wanting to be open to the community and protecting congregants. It's a tough, conflicting thing.” Meanwhile, the Interfaith Solidarity Network, a group comprised of L.A.-area faith-based leaders seeking to inspire solidarity and interfaith dialogue – issued a statement Saturday about the shootings. “The ISN condemns the shooting as a xenophobic act of violence stemming from ongoing national divisive rhetoric and policies, and stands in solidarity with the victims of this heinous and racist act,” the organization said. “The ISN also calls on all faith-based leaders across the country to step up efforts toward building bridges of tolerance, peace and unity. The ISN plans to hold an Interfaith Solidarity March on Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. to foster understanding and unity through shared values. The mile-long march will begin at Temple Aliyah, 6025 Valley Circle Boulevard, in Woodland Hills, proceed to Presbyterian Church, 5751 Platt Avenue, and end at Ezzi Masjid Mosque, 5701 Platt Avenue. 12:10 p.m.: This article was updated with new information from local officials. 10:00 a.m.: This article was updated with new information from LAPD.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-sheriff-tattoo-liability-20181027-story.html---split---The image on the deputy’s calf depicted a skeleton in an officer’s uniform, wearing a cowboy hat and clutching a smoking rifle. Jason Zabala said he was inked by an artist who worked at a Sunset Beach tattoo shop and was the 140th person to get the same design. The tattoo, he said, was a proud mark of camaraderie among his fellow peace officers. But years later, a judge would order Zabala and another Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy to answer questions about whether they were members of a clique and allow their tattoos to be photographed as part of a wrongful-death lawsuit. The county paid $1.5 million to settle the case last year. Zabala denied he was part of a clique. The Sheriff’s Department is paying a growing price for its failure to find a solution for an issue that decades of watchdog reports and lawsuits have highlighted as a problem. The tattoos and questions about cliques are being used to challenge deputies’ credibility in court. Officers who are sued over allegations of excessive force have been compelled to answer questions about their ink and allow it to be photographed. “What goes around comes around,” said Merrick Bobb, who was a civilian monitor of the Sheriff’s Department for 22 years. He said the persistence of deputy cliques demonstrates a failure of management. “This is bound to remain an issue as long as the deputies continue to do it,” he said. Few police agencies in the nation have received as much public scrutiny over tattoos and alleged cliques. Similar stories of officer cliques have surfaced in Oakland, New Orleans and the Los Angeles Police Department, but the accounts date back several years and rarely involved exclusive membership. It remains unclear how pervasive the cliques are. Some deputies defend tattoos as fostering morale, arguing that they don’t signify an outlaw culture. Some have also said they have a free-speech right to wear them. The Sheriff’s Department, however, has continued to face fresh allegations of misconduct attributed to branded groups. Just this month, three sheriff’s deputies and a sergeant were placed on leave in connection with an off-duty fight that some deputies say was a dispute over membership in the Banditos, an East Los Angeles deputy club. Watchdog panels in 1992 and 2012 exhorted the Sheriff’s Department to root out gang-like deputy groups. Then-interim Sheriff John Scott said in 2014 he would share the results of an investigation into claims of bullying by the Banditos, yet the probe has remained confidential. In July, Sheriff Jim McDonnell launched what he said would be a comprehensive study of alleged deputy cliques. The inquiry came after The Times revealed that a Compton station deputy involved in a fatal shooting testified that he and as many as 20 of his colleagues have matching skull tattoos. On Thursday, a judge presiding over a wrongful-death lawsuit involving Compton station deputies said the department must reveal whether it’s identified all of the deputies at the station who have the identical tattoos. Members of the department’s civilian oversight commission Thursday also expressed frustration they had received little information about McDonnell’s inquiry. McDonnell said in a statement that his organization has taken “a very strong posture” to hold employees accountable, including recently hiring a second constitutional policing advisor to promote reforms. “We are continuing to assess any potential issues that may arise related to employee conduct, as well as personal and professional choices that impact our organization. We have the same concerns as all of law enforcement, the military, and the private sector about how to balance the constitutional right of free expression with what may, or may not be, an indicator of something more serious,” he said. For years, James Real watched as the lawmen traveled to his Sunset Beach tattoo parlor to be branded with the same design. The Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies would come in groups, sometimes socializing over pizza as they watched one of their own go under the needle, said Real, the owner of American Beauty Tattoo. An artist in his shop etched the matching motifs of a skeleton wearing a cowboy hat, adding a number in sequential order to each one — more than 100 in all. The number on Zabala’s tattoo was 140. The skeleton imprinted on his lower left leg was uniformed with a star-shaped badge, appearing next to a tombstone bearing the logo of the department’s Century station, Zabala said in a 2016 deposition that was reviewed by The Times. Zabala was deposed as part of a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the family of Terry Laffitte, who was shot by deputies in the back of the head and the leg as he lay face down in his backyard in 2013. Prosecutors said Laffitte punched Zabala’s partner and was resisting deputies while holding a revolver when Zabala shot him. The district attorney’s office determined the shooting was lawful. But Laffitte’s family alleged in court documents that Zabala and the other deputy escalated the encounter by violently dragging Laffitte to the ground after pursuing him for riding a bike without a light. The family’s lawyers claimed in their lawsuit that the deputies were part of a clique. Zabala said in depositions he was not part of a department gang. He said the tattoo, with its Old West style, honored the Sheriff’s Department’s founding in 1850, and he claimed that skeletons are “an icon of the peace officer.” “It signifies that all police officers are the same. There’s no race. There’s no gender. There’s no color. There’s no bias. It’s just everyone is the same underneath,” Zabala testified. He said he got the ink two or three months before the shooting of Laffitte. Zabala is now a gang enforcement deputy at the Carson station. He did not respond to requests for comment. It’s far from clear whether deputy tattoos or involvement in cliques have any direct role in the outcome of court cases. A Times review found more than $7 million in county payouts over the last decade in lawsuits claiming excessive force by deputies known to have matching tattoos as well as to settle a case alleging harassment by an inked deputy gang. Of that amount, $5.5 million was paid out in the last two years. Those sums are relatively small compared to the total amount the county spent in Sheriff’s Department litigation payouts over the last 10 years — at least $182 million. Watchdogs say deputies should be more aware of the legal consequences of having matching tattoos. “It makes any lawsuit extremely more complicated and increases potential liability for the county,” said Michael Gennaco, who headed the Office of Independent Review, which monitored the Sheriff’s Department, for 13 years. John Sweeney, the attorney in the wrongful-death lawsuit who elicited the admission by a Compton deputy about his tattoo, said lawyers suing the Sheriff’s Department would be silly not to depose deputies over whether they are inked. “One hundred percent of the time, I ask that question,” Sweeney said. Earlier this year, the county agreed to pay $2.5 million tied to a separate wrongful-death case involving Zabala. He was one of several deputies who fired a total of 34 rounds at Johnny Martinez, a schizophrenic man, in 2014. Prosecutors, who found the shooting was justified, said Martinez had swung a knife at officers. Some deputies have admitted that their tattoos correspond to cliques. Charles McDaniel said under oath in 2013 that his skull ink belonged to the Regulators associated with the Century station, according to a deposition reviewed by The Times. He said the tattoo signified an attachment to “friends, social group, camaraderie,” but he denied knowing about any deputy clubs that honored members who broke people’s bones — an allegation lodged against a group of deputies at Men’s Central Jail. In 2009, McDaniel was a floor sergeant at the county lockup when deputies he supervised were accused of repeatedly beating and shocking an inmate with a stun gun, leaving the man with a fractured leg and extensive injuries. A civil court jury found McDaniel liable for negligence but blamed other deputies for excessive force and battery in the case. The inmate, Tyler Willis, was awarded $290,000 — with $100,000 of the total ordered to be paid out of former Sheriff Lee Baca’s personal funds. McDaniel, now a lieutenant in the department’s custody division, did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyers argued as part of the court proceedings that he did not participate in the use of force and was not implicated in wrongdoing merely by being a supervisor. The only policy in the Sheriff’s Department about tattoos says they should remain covered while deputies are on duty. The department often notes that 1st Amendment concerns may prevent officials from crafting stricter rules barring tattoos. “It seems to me the government would have an uphill battle banning tattoos,” said Eugene Volokh, a 1st Amendment law professor at UCLA. He said California labor law also prohibits employers from interfering with an employee’s political activities, which covers a broad array of behavior that could include being part of a group. Gennaco, the former Sheriff’s Department watchdog, said the county’s lawyers have resisted past efforts to institute more restrictive policies. “It’s very difficult to undo [decades] of culture,” he said. For years, that culture may have been bolstered by the department’s denials about deputy cliques. After the Kolts Commission completed a wide-ranging investigation of the Sheriff’s Department and recommended in 1992 that officials conduct an inquiry and severely punish deputies displaying gang-like behavior, the agency dismissed the idea. “The department is confident there are no racist deputy gangs or cliques within the organization and therefore disagrees that an internal investigation is appropriate,” said Sherman Block, who was then sheriff. The department was more responsive after the Citizens’ Commission on Jail Violence issued findings about widespread mismanagement in the department in 2012. At the recommendation of the panel and other reform efforts, the department began training new deputies about destructive cliques and rotating jail assignments more regularly in order to prevent clubs from forming. Some deputies still quietly complain — as the jail violence commission pointed out — that captains and other department leaders know who the clique members are within the agency and allow them to operate. One deputy, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, said some of “the ink,” as tattooed officers are called, are hard-chargers who drive up the arrest rates at their stations even if it means violating search-and-seizure laws. “They belong to a clique, but yet they’re out there trying to put gangs away off the streets. I just find it a little hypocritical, if you ask me,” the deputy said. Another deputy has openly claimed that the cliques try to enforce unfair rules among their own colleagues. Guadalupe Lopez accused several male officers at the East Los Angeles station of being part of the Banditos, a group that she said wore tattoos of a skeleton in a sombrero and bullied female deputies into submitting to sexual advances. She claimed in a lawsuit in 2014 that after she complained about verbal abuse and hazing by her colleagues, she suffered retaliation including having eggs thrown at her car and finding a rat under it. At least four of the deputies she complained about were suspended for a few days over a range of violations including inappropriate conduct, using derogatory language and hazing. Investigators found that one of the deputies told Lopez, “Girls shouldn’t even be allowed to come into this job force,” and, “We’re going to have to regulate” you, according to an internal affairs report. Another disciplinary letter found that a different deputy told her, “If you don’t submit to the program, you’re going to have a problem.” The reports did not mention findings related to the Banditos or having tattoos. The county paid $1.5 million to settle Lopez’s case last year. She is no longer a deputy. The department has launched administrative investigations into questionable tattoos and cliques whenever the allegations have surfaced, especially if deputies were accused of violating policies, said a statement sent by Capt. Darren Harris of the Sheriff’s Department’s Information Bureau. At American Beauty Tattoo in Sunset Beach, Real said he was stunned by the number of deputies coming in for ink. It wasn’t uncommon for military members to have coordinated tattoos, he said, but Real said he felt that the identical ink on deputies was cause for concern. “It paints a very strong picture of a group of law enforcement agents that are basically unifying themselves in a way that resembles a gang,” he said.

An avowed anti-Semite walked into a synagogue and killed 11 people after screaming, “All Jews must die!” This was one week in American hate. Some of the bloodiest and most excruciatingly tense news stories in recent memory felt painfully similar to one another, unified under the same banner of racism, violent rhetoric and anger. The only difference between this week and the last is that a few of the angry, hateful people under that banner decided to go out and act on their hate. On Monday, packages containing apparent pipe bombs began to arrive at the doorsteps and offices of high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and former CIA Director John Brennan. The first showed up at a home owned by George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has been the right’s favorite punching bag, conspiracy catchall and boogeyman for decades. Five days passed, and more packages arrived. The news media pointed out that all of the victims were Trump’s public enemies, and that he’d prodded his followers to commit violence against some of them in the past. Conservatives ― including the president himself ― implied or outright stated that the bombs were a so-called false-flag operation committed by the Democrats. That, of course, turned out to be untrue. On Friday, police arrested Cesar Sayoc, 56, who was revealed to be a staunch Trump supporter and wild conspiracy theorist. His sticker-covered van suggests he committed his alleged crimes in the president’s name; some of the stickers on his van featured targets on the faces of his victims, while others were loving homages to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Trump, meanwhile, would go back to making fun of Soros by Friday night. But Sayoc also had plain old hate in his heart. His former boss revealed to HuffPost on Saturday that he looked up to the white supremacists of old ― despite flaunting his claimed Native American heritage, which the Seminole Tribe has denied ― and wished “to go back to the Hitler days.” Initially lost in that news cycle was a shooting at a Kroger in Kentucky on Wednesday. That two people died in a shooting at a grocery store wasn’t a huge surprise ― 96 people are killed by guns every day in America and hundreds more are shot ― but later it became clear that this particular shooting was a little different. Gregory Alan Bush allegedly shot a black man in the back of the head at the grocery store, shot him several more times as he lay on the ground, and then walked outside, where he shot and killed a black woman. There wasn’t an official motive on the books as of Saturday, but a witness who was armed at the time told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Bush uttered “whites don’t kill whites” as he passed by “nonchalantly.” Later it was revealed that he’d tried and failed to enter a predominantly black church minutes earlier. Suddenly, this regular American shooting story became a regular American hate story too. And then on Saturday, American hate came full circle. An anti-Semite named Robert Bowers allegedly walked into a synagogue in Pittsburgh, screamed “All Jews must die!” and then shot and killed at least 11 people and wounded more. Scans of Bowers’ social media activity ― mostly on Gab, a hub for the likes of violent neo-Nazis ― reveal that he despised Jews and subscribed to various conspiracy theories about a migrant caravan in Mexico. His anger and anxiety, fueled by the idea that Jews were bringing immigrants into the country to displace white people, ended in what’s being called the “deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” Bowers’ hate was the same as the others’. It was blind; it was given tacit endorsement through violent rhetoric coming from our pundits and our president; and it had a strong community in which to fester and grow. His act capped off a week in which hate showed what it is truly capable of in America. This story has been updated to clarify that the Seminole Tribe has denied Sayoc’s claims of Seminole heritage.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-synagogue-pittsburgh-20181028-story.html---split---They were brothers -- Cecil and David Rosenthal. And a married couple -- Sylvan and Bernice Simon. The youngest, David Rosenthal, was 54. The oldest, Rose Mallinger, was 97. They are among the 11 victims of a mass shooting in Pittsburgh whose bodies federal authorities said Sunday were found in various locations across three floors in the Tree of Life Synagogue, where three separate congregations were holding services at the time of the attack. The county medical examiner described finding ammunition “casings everywhere.” The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was formally arrested and charged late Saturday on 29 counts, including 11 counts of murder with a firearm, and several hate crime charges such as obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. The 22 murder charges are all punishable by death. The other seven charges are related to injuring officers. Bowers, who was shot and underwent surgery, remains in stable condition and under guard at a hospital, FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones told reporters at a news conference Sunday. “This is an awful, awful period for our Jewish community and especially for the families that have been affected,” said Jeffrey Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. "It’s real once you hear the names.” Police say at about 9:50 a.m. Saturday, Bowers opened fire on Sabbath services at the synagogue in Pittsburgh's historically Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, killing 11 people and wounding six more. Four officers were also injured. Three remain in the hospital. During the attack and subsequent firefight with officers, Bowers repeatedly stated his desire to kill Jewish people and made comments about genocide, according to the Department of Justice’s charging document, including, “They’re committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews.” The Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century, said Sunday that the mass shooting "was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history." Jones said authorities do not yet know why Bowers targeted the Tree of Life Synagogue or where and how Bowers obtained the AR-15 and three Glock .357 handguns used in the attack. Police barricades continued to block the streets surrounding the synagogue Sunday. Law enforcement is still checking with neighbors for video surveillance of Bowers and the scene before the attack, Jones said. Officers from multiple cities have traveled to Pittsburgh, Jones said, and law enforcement may need up to a week to fully examine and process the crime scene, he said. “This was a large, complex crime scene and much work remains to be done,” Jones said. Authorities searched Bowers’ apartment Saturday and his vehicle Sunday, Jones said, but he would not comment on what was found. The apartment is in Baldwin Borough, 12 miles from the synagogue. Bowers is scheduled to appear before a federal judge for the first time Monday afternoon. “We will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes," said U.S. Atty. Scott Brady. Bowers had a history of posting anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant statements on social media, including a post made moments before the first 911 calls were made Saturday. Dr. Karl Williams, chief medical examiner for Allegheny County, said three rabbis have worked with his staff to ensure the bodies are handled properly, but he could not say if the examinations would be completed so that they could be released for timely burial required by Jewish custom. President Trump has ordered flags on federal buildings to be flown at half-staff through Wednesday in “solemn respect” for the victims. He told reporters Saturday that "if there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him." Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the attack “one of the worst moments that we have experienced,” and pushed back on the president's comments that an armed guard would have made a difference. “We’re dealing with irrational behavior; there is no way that you can rationalize a person walking into a synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people. We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior. We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing,” Peduto said. “The approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder." Following are the names of the shooting victims released by authorities: -- Joyce Fienberg, 75, of the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh -- Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township, Pa. -- Rose Mallinger, 97, of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh -- Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough, Pa. -- Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill -- David Rosenthal, 54, (brother of Cecil), of Squirrel Hill -- Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg, Pa. -- Sylvan Simon, 86, (husband of Bernice), of Wilkinsburg -- Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill -- Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill -- Irving Younger, 69, of the Mt. Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh 10:40 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional details of the investigation. This article was originally posted at 8:40 a.m.

(AP) — A white man with a history of violence and mental illness was recorded on surveillance video apparently trying to get inside a predominantly black church in Kentucky before he went to a grocery store and fatally shot two African-Americans, police said. After releasing a photo of the suspect, authorities received a tip from an employee of the city of Jeffersontown who said he thought he saw Gregory Bush outside the First Baptist church prior to Wednesday’s shooting, city police chief Sam Rogers said. The video confirmed Bush’s presence, Rogers said. The church is headed by a black pastor and has a large African-American membership. Bush “appeared to try to gain access to the church,” Rogers said. The information came as news media outlets reported that Bush made a racial comment after the deadly shooting at a Kroger in Jeffersontown, a city of about 26,600 people on the outskirts of Louisville. Rogers said it was too soon, however, to say whether the shooting was racially motivated. “I can’t speculate on motive at this time,” the chief said at a news conference Thursday. “We are pursuing all avenues of the investigation no matter where that takes us or what it involves.” The FBI announced that it “is evaluating the evidence to determine if there were any violations of federal law.” Hate crimes are prosecuted under federal law. Rogers also said Bush apparently does have a history of mental illness, as news outlets have reported. An arrest report says Bush walked into the Kroger, pulled a gun from his waist and shot a man in the back of the head, then kept shooting him multiple times “as he was down on the floor.” The report says Bush then reholstered his gun, walked outside and killed a woman in the parking lot. Each victim died of multiple gunshot wounds, Rogers said. A man carrying a concealed weapon who happened to be in the parking lot challenged Bush, and police say the suspect then “began firing wildly” at him, putting other shoppers in the parking lot in danger. Neither man was hurt in that confrontation, Rogers said. Bystander video shows a white man in a distinctive neon-yellow shirt trying to drive away while an officer chases after him on foot. Many more officers converged on the scene and made the arrest just a few hundred yards (meters) from the store on Wednesday afternoon. Bush was jailed on $5 million bond Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of felony wanton endangerment. Ed Harrell was quoted by the Courier Journal of Louisville as saying he was waiting on his wife in the parking lot when he heard gunshots and grabbed his revolver. As he crouched down, he said he saw the gunman walk “nonchalantly” by with a gun by his side. Harrell said he called out to ask what was going on, and the gunman replied: “Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites.” Rogers said police “are aware of that statement and are evaluating any factors that may come into play with” it. He said he had “no direct knowledge” of whether there was more than one armed bystander at the scene. The local coroner’s office identified the victims as Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vicki Lee Jones, 67. Police said there didn’t appear to be any connection between Bush and the victims, or any link between Bush and the Kroger store. Stallard’s 12-year-old grandson was shopping with him in the store when he was gunned down, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf said Thursday. The boy was physically unharmed, but most certainly traumatized, the mayor said, adding, “He was there and cannot unsee what he has seen.” Stallard was the father of Kellie Watson, the chief racial equity officer for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. The mayor shared his outrage Thursday over what he called an “epidemic of gun violence” that “hit close to home.” “People getting shot at a grocery store, a school, outside a church. Can’t we all agree that that is unacceptable?” said Fischer, a Democrat running for re-election. Authorities removed computers and cellphones from the house where Bush lived with his parents. Bush’s criminal record shows he threatened his ex-wife and punched a deputy sheriff during a family court hearing years ago. He also was charged with assaulting his elderly parents in January 2009. An arrest citation said Bush’s parents were punched and choked, and they told police they were “terrified of (his) unpredictable behavior.”

---split---4.0---split---https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17847474/dr-disrespect-shooting-twitch-stream-investigation-trolls---split---Guy Beahm, best known as the boisterous PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds streamer Dr. Disrespect, abruptly stopped his Twitch broadcast today following what he says was an attempted shooting at his house. News of this apparent shooting spread primarily due to Beahm’s live stream, where he can be seen playing Call of Duty only to leave his station following an unknown noise. He breaks character and says, “someone shot at our house. Broke the fucking upstairs window. This is the second shot. Someone shot yesterday at our fucking house.” Before the broadcast ends, Beahm is visibly upset, and yells, “you pussy” at whoever perpetrated the apparent drive-by shooting. Details are scarce at the moment, but as Polygon reports, authorities in Beahm’s hometown in Southern California confirmed that this is the second report about a shot being fired at the home of someone matching Beahm’s description, and that a deputy was dispatched to investigate. The stream has since been renamed to say that Beahm is safe and that “proper measures are being taken.” Beahm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beahm, one of the personalities who helped popularize battle royale games online, has a long history of being trolled by his viewers. In the past, most interactions have been fairly low-stakes, albeit annoying for the mop-headed character: players will try to find him in-game, only to try to mess with his experience. The tactics range from naming themselves offensive things, to auditory assault, and even emote abuse. Beahm’s responses have varied from amusement to anger, at times even threatening to find harassers in real life. “They wouldn’t do anything to me in person, I’ll tell you that right now,” Beahm once said in a Fortnite live stream, in response to his trolls. “Nothing, nothing. That’s the beauty about all of this, ladies and gentlemen... You wouldn’t do anything if I were standing right next to you.” More broadly, internet personalities often have to deal with all sorts of harassment, from social media bombardment to having viewers “swat” them by calling in phony reports to the police. Earlier this year, a man by the name of Tyler Barriss was indicted after making a hoax call to 911 that resulted in the death of Andrew Finch at the hands of police who mistakenly believed Finch was dangerous. The motivation behind Beahm’s apparent shooting is currently unknown. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.
---split---4.0---split---https://apnews.com/b1c50ba4f0964df89a266e490aea6961---split---This image shows a portion of an archived webpage from the social media website Gab, with a Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018 posting by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. HIAS, mentioned in the posting, is a Maryland-based nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. (AP Photo) WASHINGTON (AP) — The man arrested in the mass shooting Saturday at a Pennsylvania synagogue appears to have made virulently anti-Semitic posts on a social media platform popular with far-right extremists, including one made shortly before the attack. Police have identified the suspect as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh. A man with the same name posted on the site Gab.com on the morning of the shooting that “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” HIAS is a Maryland-based nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history. President and CEO Mark Hetfield said he wasn’t aware of the shooter’s “obsession with HIAS until this morning.” The shooter opened fire at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, killing 11 people and wounding at least six others including four police officers. Bowers was wounded in a shootout with police and was reported to be in custody Saturday at a nearby hospital. President Donald Trump characterized the mass shooting as an anti-Semitic attack and law enforcement officials said they were investigating it as a hate crime. Bowers has no apparent criminal record. He was registered in Allegany County, which includes Pittsburgh, as an unaffiliated voter. Heavily armed officers responded to an apartment building in Pittsburgh on Saturday afternoon that may have been associated with Bowers. In a statement, Gab.com said it suspended the alleged gunman’s account Saturday morning shortly after his name was mentioned on police radio chatter. The company said it backed up the content of the account and notified the FBI. Gab has become an alternative to Twitter for users whose racist and harassing online behavior got them banned from the mainstream platform. The company said it disavows acts of terrorism and violence, but sees its mission as defending “free expression and individual liberty online for all people.” Gab founder and CEO Andrew Torba declined to answer emailed questions posed by an AP reporter. A post made on the site’s Twitter account on Saturday appeared to revel in the attention prompted by the killings, saying “We have been getting 1 million hits an hour all day.” The Associated Press reviewed an archived version of the posts made under Bowers’ name. The screen name @onedingo, used on the Gab account, matches email addresses listed for Bowers in online databases that contain the same “onedingo” moniker. In the description on his account, Bowers wrote “jews are the children of satan.” The cover photo featured the neo-Nazi symbol “1488.” The first two numbers refer to the white supremacist “14 Words” slogan, while “88″ stands for “Heil Hitler” since “H″ is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Among his recent posts, Bowers posted a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews, writing the caption “Make Ovens 1488F Again.” But in other posts he also featured memes containing false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust — in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished — was a hoax. Another post derided Trump for being “a globalist, not a nationalist” and added that “there is no #MAGA” as long as there is a Jewish “infestation,” using a slur for Jews. The same post also referenced QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory that started on the message board 4chan and has been spread by a fringe element of the president’s supporters. Bowers also recently posted a photo of a collection of three black semi-automatic handguns he titled “my glock family,” a reference to the Austrian firearms manufacturer. He also posted photos of bullet holes in person-sized targets at a firing range, touting the “amazing trigger” on his weapon. ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-laments-hate-our-country-after-synagogue-murders-says-armed-n925216---split---WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump lamented the "hate in our country" and condemned anti-Semitism after the killing of 11 people in a lone gunman's shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday and asserted that better security at the congregation could have prevented the massacre. "They had a maniac walk in and they didn't have any protection and that is so sad to see," Trump said at Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs before he departed for a campaign swing in the Midwest. "If you take a look at it, if they had protection inside the results would have been far better." Trump's suggestion was similar to his proposal after February's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that schoolteachers should be armed. He also placed the shootings in the context of a long series of violent acts nationally and globally. "It's a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world," the president said. "It's a violent world. You think when you're over it, it just goes away but then it comes back in the form of a madman, a wacko." Later, at a Future Farmers of America conference in Indianapolis, Trump said the nation and the world are "shocked and stunned" by the "anti-Semitic act" in Pittsburgh — one of several references he made to anti-Semitism. "You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don't seem to learn from the past," he said, noting that the shootings took place during a baby-naming ceremony at the synagogue. "There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America or anywhere." Trump arranged for a pastor and a rabbi to lead the conference in prayers. Aboard Air Force One, before he arrived in Indianapolis, Trump told reporters he was considering cancelling a "Make America Great Again" campaign rally scheduled for later Saturday in Illinois. But by the time he spoke to the FFA group, he had decided to go ahead with the political event. "At first, I was thinking 'I'll cancel' and then I said we can't let evil change our life and change our schedule," Trump said. "Otherwise, we give them too much credit, we make them too important." Comparing his decision to the reopening of the New York Stock Exchange following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S., Trump said he felt duty-bound to hold the rally. "You go with a heavy heart but you go," he said. "Not that I want to go. But I think, actually in reverse, (I) have an obligation to go." Trump urged Americans to "come together" in the wake of the shootings. But later in his speech, he took swipes at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In praising Republican congressmen, Trump said he wouldn't talk about their Democratic opponents. "I won’t tell you that they’re aligned with Nancy Pelosi," he said. "I’m going to be nice." And, as he often does at campaign rallies, he reminded the audience that Warren's recent DNA test showed that she has relatively little Native American ancestry — a point he has dwelled on as he has ridiculed her for identifying herself as Native American on university personnel forms many years ago. Before his rally in Murphysboro, Ill., Saturday night, Trump said that he planned to tone down his usual campaign event remarks. But his speech was full of attacks on familiar foils, including Warren, Pelosi and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. And he picked on a new target: Conservative journalist and pundit Bill Kristol, a frequent Trump critic. He called Kristol one of the "losers" who has opposed him and, at length, mocked the Weekly Standard editor at large for his inaccurate prognostications during the 2016 campaign. "Some guy named Bill Kristol," Trump said. "He called it wrong from Day One." Police arrested the suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin, a borough south of Pittsburgh, and he was charged with 29 federal counts Saturday night, officials said. Four police officers were injured in the shooting, according to Wendell Hissrich, the city's public safety director, who spoke at a news conference. Trump also said that the death penalty should be more swiftly applied to mass murderers. "I think they should stiffen up laws, and I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue," he said. Asked by reporters about his close relationship with the National Rifle Association, Trump stressed his view that having armed guards at the synagogue might have made a difference — and said it might be necessary to have them at all houses of worship in the United States. "I hate to think of it that way," the president said. "It's certainly an option." He said that he will travel to Pittsburgh but declined to elaborate on when he'll make the trip. Vice President Mike Pence also addressed the murders during an appearance in Las Vegas. "What happened in Pittsburgh today was not just criminal, it was evil," Pence said, adding praise for the "swift response" of law enforcement. "There is no place in America for violence or anti-Semitism." Pence asked all Americans to pray for those killed or injured in the shooting and their families. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-chicago-police-20170521-story.html#nt=barker&bn=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It---split---Chicago police officials have announced policy changes intended to cut back on questionable shootings and other uses of force that have haunted the department for years. The changes, made after months of revisions, will tighten Police Department rules that experts and advocates have criticized as too permissive of unnecessary uses of force. The policy changes — expected to take effect this fall — represent a milestone for a department upended nearly 18 months ago by the release of video of a white officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. The revised rules, however, do not go as far in some respects as the rules proposed by Police Supt. Eddie Johnson in October, when the department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel faced more intense federal scrutiny amid the immediate fallout over the video. The final version of the department's main use-of-force policy substantially resembles the scaled-back proposal Johnson made in March after rank-and-file police complained that his first proposal was too extreme. In one key change, the policy holds that an officer can't shoot a fleeing suspect unless that person presents an imminent threat to police or others. The rule that has been in place says an officer can shoot any person fleeing after committing or trying to commit a felony using force. The new policy also calls on officers to use their new deescalation training to try to defuse incidents. But the adopted language is less strict than what Johnson first proposed. Officers have to try deescalation only "when it is safe and feasible to do so." Johnson announced the new rules Wednesday at an event at police headquarters designed to show unity among his command staff, rank-and-file officers and residents. Johnson was also joined by activist William Calloway, who helped force the release of the McDonald video. On stage during questioning by the media, Calloway greeted Johnson with a handshake and said, "What's up, Supe?" He credited the protests over the McDonald shooting with creating change in the department. "This is a big win for us, that our voices were heard," Calloway said. But he added the caution that it won't be clear how effective the rules are until they are in place. The policies are yet another point of disagreement between top department officials and the Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents rank-and-file officers and whose contract with the city expires this year. Kevin Graham, elected union president last month, released a statement decrying the "anti-law enforcement climate" in Chicago. Graham has opposed the idea that the department needs outside oversight or tougher discipline. "Three Chicago police officers have been shot in the last two weeks. The reality is that many offenders do not want to go to jail and they become resistant or combative with officers. These violators determine the level of response by officers," Graham said. "For these reasons, we do not believe that extensive changes should be made to the current use of force policy. Nevertheless, we are always willing to discuss new measures with the superintendent that [ensure] the safety of our officers and [that] of the public," the statement read. In a break from tradition for a department that has done little to train officers on policy changes, all of the approximately 12,000 officers will receive both computerized and in-person training on the new use-of-force rules, Johnson announced. Officer discipline has been rare and often light in Chicago, and oversight officials aiming to strengthen accountability have sought changes to use-of-force policies widely criticized as too permissive. More specific rules could give disciplinary authorities stricter standards to apply to officers who use force in questionable circumstances. The department's force policies drew intense focus after Emanuel was forced in November 2015 to release video from the year before of Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police with a knife in his hand. Furious protests followed, and the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the department. Emanuel, meanwhile, made changes aimed at getting ahead of federal authorities. One of his early moves was to propose new rules on the use of force. Hinkle writes for the Chicago Tribune.

The 20-year-old was withdrawing from his siblings and cousins, whom he had long considered his closest friends. He would laugh out loud for no apparent reason. He told doctors in Tulsa, Okla., that something was "taking over" his brain. One day last year, Colbert abruptly boarded a Greyhound bus to Southern California. Days later, police say, he walked up to a woman and her 4-year-old daughter as they were returning home from buying groceries and fatally shot them. The killing of Carina Mancera and her daughter, Jennabel, stunned the downtown Long Beach community and baffled investigators for months. Colbert was eventually linked to the crime through DNA. But authorities have not identified a motive for the slayings or said whether he knew the victims. Prosecutors describe the attack as an ambush, alleging Colbert hid before shooting the mother and daughter. Whatever the motive, Colbert had been struggling with mental illness for some time, isolating himself from his loved ones and using a dangerous synthetic drug in the years before the shootings, according to a review of medical records and court documents and interviews with Colbert's relatives. Despite this history, Colbert, now 23, is acting as his own attorney in a case in which prosecutors could seek the death penalty. During recent court hearings, he has denied involvement in the shootings and raised bizarre conspiracy theories in his defense. At one point, he claimed the victims he is accused of killing are still alive. He has not raised insanity as a possible defense. Colbert's relatives and several defense lawyers have said he is incapable of representing himself. On Monday, a judge is expected to decide whether Colbert is mentally competent to stand trial. The description of Colbert stalking a Long Beach street with a shotgun makes little sense to Yolanda Colbert. Her son was never violent or troubled, she said, but a 2014 diagnosis of mental illness was part of a downward spiral, one that may have sparked his move to California and turned him into a man she barely recognizes now. "He was just talking out of his head.… We're a very close family and he just kept saying that things were out to get him and the CIA was after him and stuff like that," she said. "He wasn't himself." Growing up in Tulsa, Colbert was a bit of a loner, with simple pleasures and simple aims, relatives said. He made good grades in high school, and he was on the football and wrestling teams. Far from a social butterfly, Colbert focused on family, spending most weekends with his siblings and cousins, playing video games or hanging around the house, said his younger sister, Breyan. Colbert hoped to become a dentist, and he started working as a dental assistant after high school. He was fired in 2013 after failing a drug test for using marijuana, his mother said. "I think that kind of broke his spirit right there," Yolanda Colbert said. Months later, Colbert grew withdrawn and paranoid, expressing concern that something was "taking over" his brain, according to his family and medical records reviewed by The Times. In October 2014, he spent two weeks at a mental health facility in Tulsa, where he was diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, meaning he was presenting symptoms of schizophrenia but not for the six-month period necessary for a formal diagnosis, records show. He admitted to near daily use of marijuana and some use of "K2," also known as "spice," a synthetic form of marijuana that can lead to psychotic episodes and violent outbursts. The drug can also exacerbate underlying symptoms of mental illness, said Michael Levine, the chief of the division of medical toxicology at USC. It is unclear how often Colbert was using spice, but doctors in Oklahoma feared he had downplayed how frequently he was smoking it, records show. Colbert was released after 13 days at the facility, and doctors said he was not having suicidal or homicidal thoughts at the time, according to a medical report. Medication prescribed to Colbert kept the symptoms at bay for a while, though his sister said he struggled to accept his diagnosis. He did not like taking the medication, and was unable to find a new job, relatives said. Colbert stopped taking the medication early in 2016, his mother said. The symptoms soon returned. Yolanda Colbert said she sought a court order to have her son resume treatment. Colbert was not found to be a danger to himself and was allowed to remain out of treatment, she said, and the decision to try to force him into a mental health facility opened up a rift between mother and son. "He was mad at me so he wasn't talking to me," she said. "He was basically isolating himself. Just distancing himself from his family." Colbert boarded a California-bound bus in Tulsa on Aug. 3, 2016, and arrived in Los Angeles the next day, police said. His mother assumed her son was traveling west to look for work. Breyan said her brother had always wanted to go to California, but didn't give a reason for this specific trip. He didn't know anyone in the state, she said. On Aug. 6, Carina Mancera, 26, was returning to her Long Beach home just north of downtown after a trip to the grocery store with her 4-year-old daughter, Jennabel Anaya, and her longtime boyfriend, Luis Anaya. As they walked from their car, a man wearing "all black" stepped out from behind a concrete sign and opened fire, according to testimony Anaya gave at a March hearing in Colbert's case. As his girlfriend and daughter fell to the street, Anaya said, he briefly locked eyes with the gunman. "When I tried to look at him, he shot at me," a tearful Anaya told reporters the morning after the killings. The final shot missed, and the gunman fled, Anaya said. Seconds later, Anaya raced toward his girlfriend and their daughter, stumbling into a horrific scene. Mancera died almost instantly, court records show. Jennabel lay near her mother, bleeding and screaming. One of the girl's arms had been "blown off," Anaya testified. He put the child on the phone with her grandmother, desperate to comfort her, but Jennabel died a short time later at a hospital. The shooting left investigators and those close to the victims scratching their heads. Anaya and Mancera had been dating for five years and were well-liked in the neighborhood, friends said. Police dismissed any suggestion that the attack was linked to drug or gang activity. A Long Beach homicide sergeant described the case as a "whodunit." Two months later, police released surveillance video of a man lurking in the area and riding a Blue Line train with luggage on the night of the shooting. They described him as a "person of interest," but didn't know who he was or whether he was still in California. In some of the videos, a long narrow object could be seen protruding from the man's bags. Investigators now believe it was the nose of the murder weapon: a shotgun. By this point, Colbert was in county jail. Los Angeles police had arrested him on suspicion of car theft on Aug. 27, though those charges were later dropped, court records show. Yolanda Colbert said she traveled to Los Angeles to visit her son after he was arrested, and found he had been placed on suicide watch. "I don't want you to see him like this," a public defender told her. The defense lawyer raised doubts as to Colbert's mental health in the car theft case, but he was found competent to stand trial in November, records show. Days later, he was charged with two counts of murder in the Long Beach shootings. DNA found on a shotgun shell at the crime scene linked Colbert to the killings, according to court records. I don’t believe these people are actually dead because I said this is like a Hollywood movie and I’m not an actor and I don’t want to play this game.” As his case moves toward trial, Colbert's mental health has become a central issue. A lawyer hired by his family pleaded with the court to block Colbert from acting as his own attorney. Last month, prosecutors filed a motion asking a judge to determine whether or not Colbert is capable of representing himself. In the motion, prosecutors referred to Colbert as a "gray-area defendant," who might be competent to stand trial, but not capable of legally defending himself. A judge in April ordered Colbert to undergo a mental health evaluation. In recent months, Colbert has appeared confused and unnerved during a series of pre-trial hearings. At several points, he has asked judges for advice on how to proceed, over admonishments that the court cannot aid in his defense. During his preliminary hearing in March, Colbert did not call any witnesses, and entered only one item into evidence: the bus ticket proving he traveled from Oklahoma to California days before the shooting. He also countered the prosecution's claim that he brought the murder weapon from Oklahoma, claiming he pawned a shotgun back home to obtain bus fare to California. Mostly, he has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Colbert has repeatedly insisted he is being framed. He has made several references to the 1997 crime drama "Gang Related." The movie, starring James Belushi and Tupac Shakur, centers on a pair of corrupt police officers who frame a homeless man for the murder of an undercover federal agent. During the March hearing, Colbert made his boldest and strangest claim: that the mother and daughter he is accused of killing are still alive. "I don't believe these people are actually dead because I said this is like a Hollywood movie and I'm not an actor and I don't want to play this game," he said, according to a transcript of the hearing. Jim Preis, an attorney specializing in mental health law who now serves as executive director at Mental Health Advocacy Services in Los Angeles, said Colbert's prior diagnosis would not automatically preclude him from being found competent to stand trial. A defendant's ability to stand trial can change over time, he said. A judge would need to determine that Colbert understands what is going on in the courtroom and is capable of assisting in his own defense in order to determine he is fit to stand trial. If Colbert is allowed to stand trial, that does not necessarily mean he is competent to represent himself, Preis said. A separate hearing could be ordered to determine if Colbert can act as his own attorney, Preis said, adding that a judge would need to believe Colbert is capable of "organizing and presenting his own defense." In March, Colbert filed a rambling, handwritten note asking for the case to be dismissed. "I have substantial evidence of a theory of a setup, of staged circumstances," he wrote.

That marked a huge drop from the 38.3 percent the CDU won at the last Hesse election, in 2013. The center-left Social Democrats ... Democratic donor Tom Steyer on Sunday denounced as anti-Semitic a now-deleted tweet from Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, that said Steyer and two other wealthy donors were trying to buy the November congressional elections. McCarthy's tweet, posted on Tuesday and deleted the next day, was captured in images on media sites. It referred to financier George Soros, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Steyer, all billionaires who donate heavily to liberal causes. All three have Jewish family backgrounds.

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts shrugged off U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of his decision to replace starting pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning of the World Series on Saturday, calling his critical tweet "one man's opinion". Roberts elected to take Hill out of the game with one out and one runner on base despite Hill having only given up one hit, a move that backfired as the Dodgers bullpen was battered in a 9-6 loss to the Boston Red Sox. "Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings," Trump wrote in his tweet. "It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is... Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD), hurt in a regional election in Hesse on Sunday, are planning a new roadmap for their national government with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, party leader Andrea Nahles said.

Asked if he was afraid, he told The Times magazine: "I let go immediately. I knew it was going to be there, because I smoked for England for 54 years. It was, 'God, of course I've got cancer of the lung. But I haven't got it anywhere else.' I knew I was strong enough not to let it be anywhere else in my body." Ronnie's lung ...

---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-synagogue-needed-armed-guard-stop-arming-society/story?id=58803241---split---On the day after a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, city officials responded to President Donald Trump's suggesting that the house of worship should have had armed guards. Pittsburgh City Council member Erica Strassburger told ABC News "This Week" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz that although an armed guard "could have saved lives" at the synagogue, putting guns in the hands of more people isn't the answer to violence in the U.S. "If you think about it ... yesterday it was at a synagogue, it might be at a school, but the next time it could be at a grocery store or at a public market," said Strassburger, who represents the neighborhood where the shooting occurred. "Where do we stop with arming our entire society and feeling as if we can’t be safe anywhere? I just don’t see that as the answer." City Council member Corey O’Connor, who also represents the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the massacre happened, agreed that having armed guards at every venue isn’t a solution. “That’s not the community we want," O'Connor told Raddatz. "We don’t want people having armed guards at every door you walk into.”   Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also responded to the president's remark about the need for armed guards, saying at a press conference Sunday that what's needed instead is to make sure people "looking to express hatred through murder" don't have access to guns.   "We're dealing with an irrational behavior," Peduto said at the news conference. "We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior. We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior in the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing." The mayor continued, "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder."   President Trump on Saturday strongly condemned the shooting in Pittsburgh as "evil." Early in the day, just a few hours after the shooting, the president said, "It’s presumed that this is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately ... Maybe nobody would have been killed except for him. So it’s a very, very difficult situation." When a reporter asked if all synagogues and churches should have armed guards, Trump said, "I hate to think of it that way ... It’s certainly an option." The president has also in the past called for arming teachers as a way to prevent school shootings. After a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in February killed 17, Trump told a conservative conference, "When we declare our schools gun-free zones it just puts our students in far more danger."     Arming staff at the school would be "a major deterrent," he said. The massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday killed 11 people and injured at least six more, including four police officers who responded to the gunfire. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, who has been arrested and charged, had allegedly posted anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant messages on social media, including one post that said, “Jews are the children of Satan.”

The gathering included prayers and singing in memory of those killed and wounded.(Oct. 27) AP Sukanya Srinivasan, 46, watches as hundreds gather during a vigil outside the Jewish Community Center. A Squirrel Hill resident since 1997. "Squirrel Hill is so inclusive, you’d never imagine something like this to ever happen here," said Srinivasan. (Photo: Neil Strebig) PITTSBURGH – It has become a refrain every time something like this happens. “I never expected something like this happening here,” Greg Stalfa said as he sipped a beer at the Squirrel Hill Café, a neighborhood bar just a few blocks where something like this happened. Something like this was the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday morning that left 11 dead and six wounded – including four police officers. The Anti-Defamation League believes this to be the deadliest attack on Jews in the nation’s history. “This is a great neighborhood,” said Stalfa, a supervisor with the state Department of Labor and Industry who grew up on its tree-lined streets. Mark Esper, a waiter sitting one stool down, said, “This is probably the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh. You could lie down on the sidewalk at 2 o’clock in the morning and nothing would happen to you.” Across Forbes Avenue from the café, thousands gathered to mourn and stand vigil, holding candles, praying, singing, weeping, consoling one another. Story continues after these videos from Pittsburgh Support truth: Subscribe to YDR.com Ruth Fauman-Fichman, a retired archaeologist, hugged a woman wearing a hijab, who consoled her by saying how shocking the mass shooting was and how it wasn’t the kind of thing you expected to happen here. Fauman-Fichman, whose mother escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and whose 93-year-old aunt is a Holocaust survivor, responded, “It can happen anywhere. It happens every day.” Squirrel Hill, just east of downtown Pittsburgh, is believed to have been named by in recognition of the abundance of gray squirrels in the area. The neighborhood evolved into one of the city’s more affluent sections, the streets lined with single-family homes. Carnegie Mellon and Chatham universities are located there and many of the faculty live in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, Mister Rogers, the soft-spoken voice of tolerance, love and understanding, called the neighborhood home. Squirrel Hill’s identity developed in the 1920s when Eastern European Jews moved into the neighborhood, which soon developed into the city’s center of Jewish culture. Half of Pittsburgh’s Jewish population – about 50,000 people – lives in the neighborhood. It is, many residents said, a tight-knit community. The Tree of Life Synagogue has long been at the center of the neighborhood’s religious and cultural life, its history dating to the late 1800s. “Traditionally, the neighborhood has been a Jewish enclave,” said David Tessitor, who was walking a friend’s greyhound, Chelsea, by the synagogue Saturday evening. “But it’s very diverse.” A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Tessitor said, “The more it happens, the more it happens.” He believes that hatred and violence have always been with us, but that our current culture, one in which the president of the United States denounces people and cozies up to white nationalists, “sets a very scary tone.” Still, Tessitor, a community organizer and political activist, said, “This kind of thing just doesn’t happen here.” Anti-Semitic violence has occurred in Squirrel Hill. On April 17, 1986, a 24-year-old rabbinical student from Toronto, Neal Rosenblum, was shot five times and killed while walking to his in-laws home on Shady Avenue. He had been in town only seven hours when he was gunned down. Steven Tielsch of Penn Hills was arrested in 2000 and eventually convicted of third-degree murder in what prosecutors described as a hate crime. Many in Squirrel Hill's Jewish community still remember Rosenblum’s murder. Now, though, they have a more terrible memory to take its place. Residents gather outside of the Sixth Presbyterian Church located at the corner of Murray and Forbes Ave. in Pittsburgh PA during a candlelight vigil mourning the victims of Tree of Life synagogue shooting on Saturday, October 27, 2018. (Photo: Neil Strebig) David Knoll, a 40-year-old real estate broker, was walking down the street from the synagogue, talking to his 9-year-old son, trying to explain to the child what was happening, why people were crying. Earlier Saturday, Knoll and his family had been locked down in the synagogue while police sought the gunman and secured the neighborhood. It was scary for Knoll. It’s hard to imagine how scary it was for his son. “You have to explain that there are bad people out there,” Knoll said. “It doesn’t happen every day and there are many more good people out there than bad people.” He took a breath. “It’s terrifying,” said Knoll, whose grandparents lost most of their family in the Holocaust. “It’s not the first time it’s happened in our history, going back thousands of years. But it’s not just a Jewish thing. Some people have to hate other people, whether it’s Jews, or Muslims, or African-Americans. The man who did this did this because he hates Jews. He’s not the first and, unfortunately, he won’t be the last.” The intersection of Forbes and Murray, outside the Jewish Community Center and across Murray from the Sixth Presbyterian Church, was jammed, people of all faiths gathering in a chilly drizzle to stand vigil. Tammy Thompson, wearing a traditional hijab of her Muslim faith, embraced her friends. “I have a lot of friends in the community,” said Thompson, who runs an anti-poverty program in the city. “These people are like my family.” She hugged a friend and said, “Anything that hurts one of us, hurts all of us.” Fauman-Fichman told the story of Rabbi Morris Adler. She grew up in Detroit and there was a deeply disturbed young man who lived across the street. Her father tried to get him help. The rabbi tried to counsel him. On Feb. 12, 1966, the young man, Richard Wishnetsky, then 23, walked into Temple Sha’arey Zedek and in front of about 1,000 worshipers, shot the rabbi five times before turning the gun on himself. Fauman-Fichman was 9-years-old when it happened. “Violence in a synagogue is not anything unusual to me,” she said. Hours later, in front of the Tree of Life, 14 bouquets of flowers had been placed along a row of hedges. Across the street, a group of Orthodox rabbis prayed.

(Photo: Jeffrey Becker, USA TODAY Sports) A 46-year-old man is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday in the deadliest attack on Jewish Americans practicing their beliefs in U.S. history. The mass shooting left 11 dead and six others wounded, including four police officers. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, carried an arsenal of weapons during the spree including one assault rifle and three handguns. He was taken into custody after being wounded in a shootout with police at the scene. Those killed Saturday included middle-aged brothers, an elderly husband and wife and a grandmother nearing 100. Before the attack, Bowers posted on Gab, a fringe social network whose relaxed rules have opened it to anti-Semitic posts. Such posts, along with bomb threats and assaults toward Jewish Americans, have become increasingly common in recent years, data show. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called Saturdays shooting rampage at a synagogue it the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." (Oct. 28) AP Vice President Mike Pence denied that President Donald Trump's habit of attacking opponents contributed to the shooting that left 11 people dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday or the bombs that were mailed to a number of political figures last week. "Look, everyone has their own style. And frankly, people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences," Pence told NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard Saturday when asked if he has ever suggested to Trump to tone down the rhetoric. "But I just don't think you can connect it to threats or acts of violence, Vaughn. And I don't think the American people connect it." President Donald Trump is responding to what he's calling the "devastating" shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying: "It's a 'terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country." (Oct. 27) AP The Boston Red Sox stood on the brink of a World Series crown Sunday after two epic weekend games. After the longest postseason game in Major League Baseball history Friday, in which the Dodgers kept hopes alive with a 3-2 win in 18 innings, the Red Sox rallied on Saturday to take a 3-1 advantage in the series. President Donald Trump criticized Dodgers manager Dave Roberts for his pitching moves in the loss. In Sunday's Game 5, Boston will start David Price over Chris Sale. The Dodgers counter with Clayton Kershaw, who has 23 postseason starts but a 4.28 career postseason ERA. President Donald Trump took to Twitter following Game 4 of the World Series to question Dodgers manager Dave Roberts' decision-making. USA TODAY Despite roadblocks, the migrant caravan continues to inch closer to the capital of Mexico City and ultimately the U.S. border. Rows of police impeded the migrants’ path Saturday, prompting hours of negotiations to inform caravaners of an offer involving temporary work visas. Successful applicants would also receive health benefits and could enroll children in school. An assembly of caravan participants voted to reject it and continue toward the border. The Trump administration is reviewing options to restrict or block the migrants' ability to enter the country, including denying asylum. The group is still more than 1,000 miles away from the border and moving slowly. As a migrant caravan moves north through Mexico, others seeking asylum in the U.S. are already camped along the border waiting for their chance to make it across. Asylum seekers wait for weeks just to submit claims to U.S. officials. (Oct 25) AP Two winners, from Iowa and New York, will split the estimated $687.8 million jackpot, according to Powerball.

Rabbi Shumley Boteach, Father Jonathan Morris and Dr. Qanta Ahmed react to the deadly attack on the Tree of Life synagogue. President Donald Trump mourned the dead and forcefully condemned anti-Semitism after a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting shows anti-Semitism is a serious problem in America that must not be ignored. The shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue where I prayed for years continues the long history of anti-Semitism. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the pipe bomb mailings are rooted in hatred. A police official says there are "multiple casualties" in a shooting near a synagogue in Pittsburgh. President Donald Trump on Saturday condemned the "wicked act of mass murder" at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying anti-Semitism "must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears" and speculating that the death toll would have been curbed if an armed guard had been in the building. After the Pittsburgh synagogue attack we must fight anti-Semitism and improve security measures.

Trump decided to go ahead with both events, but he did joke at the convention for young future farmers that he almost canceled for another reason ― a bad hair day.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/religious-leaders-synagogue-shooting-squirrel-hill-pittsburgh_us_5bd4a96be4b0a8f17ef84a4f---split---Religious leaders and groups have begun to publicly respond to the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday morning. The shooter killed eleven people and injured six people, including four police officers who were injured. The shooting will be prosecuted as a hate crime, with the FBI leading an investigation, Pittsburgh police have said. Law enforcement officials have identified a suspect, Robert Bowers, who has been taken into custody. There were multiple fatalities and six injuries. 4 of the six injured were Police Officers, three of whom were shot. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt released a statement calling it the “deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” “Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh,” the statement said. We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States. Our full statement: https://t.co/NdyGjtGaM7 The shooting occurred at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha congregation in the residential Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Rabbi Alvin Berkun, rabbi emeritus of Tree of Life Or L’Simcha, described Squirrel Hill as “an amazing neighborhood” in an interview with ABC News. “It’s dominated by the Jewish Community Center four blocks away, dominated by kosher stores, kosher bakeries, all kinds of Jewish gift shops, book shops ... number of synagogues,” he said. Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh CEO Jeffrey Finkelstein, who is not a member of the Tree of Life congregation, told CNN in an interview “this should not be happening.” "This should not be happening, period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighborhood." Jeff Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, reacts to the deadly shooting at a local synagogue. https://t.co/AX4pnFjBr5 pic.twitter.com/J3HAbnOLWj “My heart goes out to all these families ― this should not be happening, period,” he said. “It should not be happening in a synagogue, it should not be happening in our neighborhood here in Squirrel Hill.” When asked to address the fact that the shooting will be investigated as a hate crime, Rabbi Chuck Diamond, former rabbi of the Tree Of Life Or L’Simcha, told local CBS affiliate KDKA that he works to teach “tolerance to all people.” “There’s hate in this world, but we have to have tolerance, and I try to teach tolerance to all people, even if they disagree with you,” he said. “There’s different ways to observe God, and there’s different paths to take, but we just have to try to be tolerant. Because of the hate, we have to fight hate by doing good things.” Diamond also noted that he had feared something like this would happen “because of the world we live in.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also released a video statement on Twitter mourning the deaths Saturday. I was heartbroken and appalled by the murderous attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue today: pic.twitter.com/NBMO31lMU2 “I was heartbroken and appalled, by the murderous attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue today,” he said. “The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh, we stand together with the American people, in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.” Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Saturday in solidarity with the Jewish community. “We condemn this heinous and cowardly attack on a house of worship, offer heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of all those who were killed or injured and express our solidarity with the Jewish community during this time of shock and grief,” said program director Zohra Lasania. CAIR-Pittsburgh chapter President Safdar Khwaja added: “This barbaric attack on our neighbors, with whom we share our city and have visited and dialogued multiple times, is deeply disturbing and horrifying. Such an act of terror affects all of us.”
---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/synagogue-shooting-shows-spread-anti-semitism-far-right-225317069.html---split---Before opening fire on a synagogue full of people in Pittsburgh on Saturday, killing 11 and injuring six others, including four police officers, suspected gunman Robert Bowers reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die!” The 48-year-old Bowers, who was taken into police custody after the shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue, is believed to have acted alone in what the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said is “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” “It is simply unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning, and unthinkable that it would happen in the United States of America in this day and age,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement Saturday. “Unfortunately, this violent attack — the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the United States since 2014 — occurs at time when ADL has reported a historic increase in both anti-Semitic incidents and anti-Semitic online harassment.” The earlier incident referenced by Greenblatt was the 2014 shooting, by a former Ku Klux Klan “grand dragon” and neo-Nazi, at two Jewish community centers outside Kansas City that left three people dead. Since then, organizations like the ADL and others observed a dramatic rise in anti-Semitism in the United States. In its annual Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents, the ADL reported nearly 2,000 cases of harassment, vandalism and physical assault targeting Jews in 2017 — 57 percent more than the year before. It was the largest single-year increase since the organization first began tracking such data in 1979, and it marked the highest number of anti-Semitic incidents on record since 1994. In particular, anti-Semitic incidents in schools and college campuses nearly doubled in 2017 for the second year in a row, contributing in part to the overall spike last year. Some of the incidents in the ADL report came from the left, in the form of “references, accusations and conspiracy theories” directed against Jews over “purported support for Israel.” “Without a doubt, we’ve seen an increase in anti-Semitic incidents,” said Adam Hertzman, director of marketing for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. Hertzman told Yahoo News on Saturday that “in general, Pittsburgh has been one of the safest cities, in terms of the Jewish community, in the United States,” but the city has not been exempt from this national trend. Two years ago, he said, the Jewish Federation hired a Jewish Community security director in response to the rise in such incidents, which has included the dissemination of neo-Nazi literature and imagery, such as swastikas. “Largely it has not been incidents of violence,” he said, adding that that is “one of the reasons we’re more shocked at this situation,” referring to Saturday’s shooting. In another recent study published on Friday, the researchers with the ADL found a significant increase in online attacks targeting Jewish politicians, journalists and others in the lead-up to next month’s midterm elections. The report found that both robot and human-run accounts were responsible for anti-Semitic tweets, leading researchers to conclude, “Both anonymity and automation have been used in online propaganda offensives against the Jewish community during the 2018 midterms.” Bowers appears to have participated in his trend. Among other social media networks, the suspect in Saturday’s shooting was active on Gab, a site popular among white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists. Bowers’s account was quickly deactivated shortly after his name was made public, but a link to his archived profile offers a glimpse at the kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric he posted, beginning with the line “jews are the children of satan” in his user bio. Two of his most recent posts, including one apparently posted this morning, refer to HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid to refugees in the U.S. According to a statement published on Medium, Gab administrators said they had suspended Bowers’s profile once they were alerted to a verified account matching the name of the suspected shooter, first backing up the user data on Bowers’s account and then alerting the FBI to its existence. “We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served,” they wrote, adding, “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” The statement attempts to dispel negative perceptions of the Gab community, insisting that the social network’s “mission is very simple: to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people.” But Bowers’s views are common on Gab. Many of the anti-Semitic posts found in Bowers’s archived feed had been reposted from the accounts of other Gab users. The ADL study on anti-Semitism leading up to the 2018 midterms also suggested a link between the rise in such attacks and the election of President Trump. Prior to the 2016 election, “anti-Semitic harassment and attacks were rare and unexpected, even for Jewish Americans who were prominently situated in the public eye,” states the report. “Following his election, anti-Semitism has become normalized and harassment is a daily occurrence.” One of the most frequently attacked individuals is George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who was among the targets of pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and members of the media earlier this week. A Florida man who identifies as a Trump supporter was arrested Friday in connection with the attempted bombings. Bowers, judging from his postings, was not a fan of Trump, whom he evidently considered insufficiently tough on foreigners, writing, “Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist. There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation.” Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are observant Jews. Following initial reports of Saturday’s shooting, Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, speculated to Yahoo News about what the gunman — whose identity was unknown at that point — might have in common with Cesar Altieri Sayoc, the suspect arrested Friday in the attempted mail bombings. “Once again, we’ve seen people … who are motivated by extremist ideas and ideologies willing to be engaged in violence,” said Beirich. “We have way too much domestic terrorism emerging from white supremacists and far-right extremists,” she continued, adding that while “that’s been going on for a long time, it doesn’t help when Trump stokes these things.” Trump has faced criticism for his response to the mailings of the pipe bombs, which were sent to high-profile critics of the president and frequent subjects of his own attacks. After initially suggesting that Saturday’s deadly events could have been avoided “if they had some kind of a protection inside the temple,” Trump later struck a more sympathetic tone at the annual Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis, where he condemned the shootings as “pure evil” and referred to them as “an anti-Semitic act.” “You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don’t seem to learn from the past,” he said, before launching into another denunciation of globalists.

Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, police said in the affidavit, which contained some previously unreported details on the shooting and the police response. The nation’s latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square. “In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence,” he said. He prayed for God “to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values.”   President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue “had some kind of protection” from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again “dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.” Calling the shooting an “evil anti-Semitic attack,” Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation’s political climate. “When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,” said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. Little was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. Authorities said it appears he acted alone. Worshippers “were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,” said Bob Jones, head of the FBI’s Pittsburgh office, though he cautioned the shooter’s full motive was not yet known. Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, pledged that “justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.” The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community. The synagogue door was unlocked on the Sabbath “because people are coming for services, and the bell would be ringing constantly. So they do not lock the door, and anybody can just walk in,” said Marilyn Honigsberg, administrative assistant for New Light. “And that’s what this man did.”   Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But security was a concern, he said, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. Zachary Weiss, 26, said his father, 60-year-old Stephen Weiss, was inside the synagogue but was unharmed. Weiss said his father told him that he and Tree of Life’s rabbi helped congregants take shelter and follow the active shooter response training they’d received months earlier. Stephen Weiss made it out of the building and used a janitor’s cellphone to call his family at home. The attack, his son vowed, “will not define our congregation and will not define our city.” ___ Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina, and Lauer reported from Philadelphia. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Mark Gillispie and Gene Puskar in Pittsburgh, Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo in Washington, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania.

Last December, the Justice Department sent a letter to the Census Bureau asking for the hotly contested question to be included on forms for the upcoming national head count. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, responded in March by approving plans to add the question. But days after the Census Bureau received the Justice... Robert Bowers, the suspect in the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, surrendered to police, and officials say he is in fair condition at Allegheny General Hospital with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities say that while Bowers' motive remains unknown, "we believe he was acting alone." Eleven people were killed in the attack, and six were injured. "We're in the early stages of this investigation," Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, told reporters during an afternoon press conference. "Over the next several days and weeks, we will look at everything in the suspec... On Aug. 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was gruesomely lynched in the small town of Money, Miss. He was a boy from Chicago, visiting his relatives. Although the case is now 63 years old, a recent book has spurred the Department of Justice to reopen the investigation into his death. Duke professor Tim Tyson has written civil rights history books that have brought national acclaim.

Sonny Fortune, a saxophonist whose powerful sound and assured yet questing style made him a steadfast presence in jazz for more than half a century, died on Thursday in New York City. He was 79. The cause was complications from a stroke, said his longtime booking agent, Reggie Marshall. Fortune had been at Mount Sinai Hospital since suffering a series of strokes in September. Principally known as an alto saxophonist, Fortune also had an authoritative voice on soprano, tenor and baritone saxophones, as well as clarinet and flute.

In a span of less than 24 hours this past week, the Trump administration took two seemingly contradictory actions that could have profound effects on the insurance marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act. Health analysts say that at least one of the efforts, coupled with previous changes initiated by the administration, could help transform the insurance market to be much more like it was before the 2010 federal health law took effect — when regulation, coverage and consumer protections varied widely across the United States. The week's first move came on Monday morning, when Trump's... President Trump and Senate Republicans are remaking the federal courts in their own image. Prior to the Trump administration, there was plenty of tit for tat in the escalating partisan wars over judicial nominations. But these tactics were aimed at blocking nominees. Since Trump was sworn in, however, the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges, casting aside long-existing practices and traditions that ensured some consensus in picking the judges who sit on the federal courts of appeal. Gone, for all practical purposes, is the tradition that prevente... Before authorities apprehended suspect Cesar Sayoc in connection to the series of mail bombs, the case prompted all sorts of speculation and conspiracy theories. The bombs were all sent to high profile critics of President Trump "It is a high probability that the whole thing is set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats," said talk radio host Michael Savage, "and to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border." "Republicans just don't do this kind of thing," Rush Limbaugh said on his program. "Remember every mass shooting there is, the Democ... Updated at 11:15 p.m. ET The man arrested Friday in the suspicious packages case was motivated to threaten and harm at least 13 Americans on the political left, according to a criminal complaint released by the Department of Justice. Cesar Sayoc allegedly placed 13 improvised explosive devices in envelopes and addressed them to political figures across the United States, prosecutors said. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the items Sayoc is accused of sending were "not hoax devices," and had the potential to do harm to recipients or others who might have come across them in the mail.

When I went trick-or-treating as a kid, there were always certain neighborhoods that would go all out. Imagine fog machines, giant spiders that suddenly moved when you walked by, pop-up clowns that refused to stay down when you hit them, bone-chilling screams triggered by reaching for candy in a bowl, the works.

Updated at 8:55 p.m. ET President Trump welcomed the arrest of a suspect behind a series of homemade pipe bombs Friday, just hours after he appeared to cast doubt on the threat posed by suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and CNN. The mixed messages were characteristic of Trump's whiplash week, in which he toggled between calls for national unity and partisan attacks on the news media.

At least three people, including the suspected gunman, were killed at a video game competition at the Jacksonville Landing. “The real issue we need to talk about right now is gun control,” he said. Gaffney also mentioned a fatal shooting that took place in the city after a high school football game Friday night. “My question I’m asking to America, I’m asking to Jacksonville, I’m asking to the state of Florida: What are we going to do about guns?” he said. “I really think we’ve got a gun problem in America. I think we’ve got a gun problem in Jacksonville.” Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), who has been criticized for not doing enough to address gun violence in the state after a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland earlier this year, tweeted Sunday afternoon that he was heading to Jacksonville to meet with local authorities. He also said President Donald Trump had offered “federal resources.” Scott made no mention of gun violence or gun control. Heading to Jacksonville now to meet with local law enforcement. State law enforcement is currently providing assistance. Just spoke with @POTUS regarding the shooting at the Jacksonville Landing. He offered any federal resources needed to respond. FDLE and the Florida Highway Patrol are currently assisting local law enforcement.

Then Golden State went out and reminded everybody the Warriors still are great, building a lead just big enough to hold off the Nets’ spirited rally. Brooklyn fell behind early, and saw a fourth-quarter comeback fall just short in falling 120-114 at Barclays Center on Sunday. “I think they’re on their way,” Golden State general manager Bob Myers told The Post before the game. “I think they’re on the way.

Nathan Eovaldi had fallen out of the Yankees rotation for two weeks in July 2016, and as a way to get back, the righty worked with pitching coach Larry Rothschild on a cutter. He returned to the rotation for five starts in which he held opponents to a .198 batting average before his elbow gave out and he needed his second Tommy John surgery. Eovaldi said he thought the addition of the pitch was just about to have him take off for the Yankees — as the inclusion of the cutter has enabled him to become a dominant force. So does his former manager. “I thought he was on the cusp of being really ... The best defense Tua Tagovailoa has faced is 80th-ranked Arkansas State. The top passing defense he’s seen is 25th-ranked Louisville, whose numbers are inflated because of how frequently the Cardinals trail. Only two of his Power 5 opponents, Texas A&M and Ole Miss, are over .500. This isn’t to suggest the dynamic sophomore is a product of a soft schedule. Or that he needs be tested. Remember, he led the Crimson Tide to the title last year by tearing apart Georgia after sitting virtually all of the season. But this year, the left-handed dynamo has not been challenged. He has rarely seen a f... Eli Manning split the uprights, his pass fired directly through the hands of Evan Engram, his pass-catching tight end. It was fourth down and the Giants had a chance to make something happen — until Engram allowed the ball to breeze between his white gloves.

New York could shave billions of dollars in bloated construction costs by overhauling a single antiquated law, according to GOP gubernatorial candidate Marc Molinaro.

CHICAGO — Sometimes, when you’re talking about a rookie quarterback in whom you’ve largely invested your immediate and long-term future, you need to take a step or two back and realize: If the growing pains are merely a dull ache, and not a sharp agony, then maybe you’re doing all right. That’s what Sam Darnold was Sunday in a 24-10 loss to the Bears: He was all right. He was 13-for-25 passing, he threw a touchdown pass (capping a drive on which, by rights, he probably should have been intercepted), and he built a QB rating of 75.8.

Look: The Jets are what they are. They are not a contender. They are not a playoff-caliber team. Could they reverse the 3-5 mark they take into the midway point and finish 8-8? Possible, but doubtful. They are a 5-6-7 win team that is now 2-10 on the road the past two seasons and sometimes looks like a JV team wandering into the varsity game when they wander free from New Jersey.

Throw chairs at them? We’re sitting ducks here.” Moscowitz, who boasts a black belt in karate and was an NYPD cop for nine years, founded a group called the International Security Coalition of Clergy, which sought to arm Jews in synagogues out of fear jihadists would attack them.

Grades from the Jets’ 24-10 loss to the Bears on Sunday: Offense The Jets barely had a pulse on offense for most of the day. They went three-and-out on six of their first eight possessions and only crossed the 50-yard line twice in the game. Injuries left rookie QB Sam Darnold (14-of-29, 153 yards, 1 TD, 75.8 rating) without many options to throw to. The rushing game was nonexistent, averaging 2.4 yards per carry.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/horrific-crime-scene-pittsburgh-synagogue-203803649.html---split---It was “a very horrific crime scene” inside the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday after a gunman burst in during Sabbath services and shot more than a dozen people, according to the city’s top law-enforcement officer. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve been on some plane crashes,” Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said, his voice breaking. “It’s — it’s very bad.” Police sources told reporters that a man, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, yelled, “All Jews must die!” before opening fire, killing 11 people, presumably worshippers, and wounding six others, including four police officers, during a rampage that lasted approximately 20 minutes. None of the victims was a child. Bowers was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with police and arrested. He is expected to face federal hate-crime charges. Stephen Weiss, a resident of Squirrel Hill, was attending the services scheduled from 9:45 a.m. until noon on Saturday. He told the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette that he could hear the loud gunfire, which sounded like an automatic weapon, as he ran to the basement, where he found other Tree of Life members sheltered in place. “It sounded like a loud crash in the hallway,” Weiss said. Michael Eisenberg, the former president of Tree of Life, told ABC7 Eyewitness News that he was getting dressed just before 10 a.m. so that he could attend morning services. The synagogue’s vice president called to tell him that there was an active shooter and to ask if he could check out what was happening, he said. “I tried heading up Shady Avenue to the building, and it was entirely blocked off — 20 or so police cars, policemen with rifles drawn, aimed at the building; they quickly told me to get away,” Eisenberg said. “Just a surreal vision for me. I still can’t process it.” Rabbi Chuck Diamond was surrounded by reporters from several media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had worked at Tree of Life until about a year ago and that the synagogue has had active-shooter drills in the past. But there was no security in place on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. “On Shabbat there’s no security. I have to tell you I always in the back of mind [thought] something like this might happen because of the way of the world today,” Diamond said. He continued, “As a Jewish professional and with what’s going on in the world, even though we’ve been fairly safe here in Pittsburgh, it’s just something that’s in the back of your mind.” Aaron Martin, an investigative reporter for WPXI, a local television station, conducted an emotional interview with a man who had close ties to the synagogue and whose father-in-law was inside the synagogue when the gunfire started but escaped to safety. “My father-in-law was inside. I got married in that place. This is crazy. This is unbelievable. People have to stop hating. It has to stop,” he told Martin. Fred Rabner, a member of the Tree of Life, described the synagogue as a “close-knit community” in an interview with CNN. He said everyone was calling one another to see whether their loved ones were harmed. “Everyone is just shaken up and upset,” Rabner said. “It’s awful, it’s just awful.” Danielle Manko, 32, a woman who lives across the street from the shooting suspect’s most recent listed address, told Yahoo News, “He’s usually never there.” “I haven’t seen him in probably, like, three weeks maybe,” she said. “They kept to themselves is pretty much what they did.” Federal investigators have already classified the mass shooting as a hate crime. The Anti-Defamation League said it is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington released the following statement in response to the shooting in Pittsburgh: “The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum strongly condemns the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and sends its deepest sympathies to the victims and families of those who were callously murdered. “Before opening fire, the alleged perpetrator reportedly yelled, ‘All Jews must die!’ The Museum reminds all Americans of the dangers of unchecked hatred and antisemitism which must be confronted wherever they appear and calls on all Americans to actively work to promote social solidarity and respect the dignity of all individuals.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News:

The survey firm YouGov recently asked the question of nearly 3,000 people in the US: 76% of Americans chose Thanksgiving, 19% Halloween, and 5% were not sure. But the differences across age groups were stark. While only 9% of people 55 or older chose Halloween, 33% of 35-44 year-olds like the spookier holiday more, the most of any age group. The survey didn’t ask why these younger adults chose Halloween. Perhaps it is the fun of dressing up kids, or fo... For the past six years, as a brutal civil war has reduced swathes of Syria to rubble, no visitors have set foot in the National Museum of Damascus. Today (Oct. 28), the museum finally re-opened its doors to tourists. The move is a sign that “Damascus has recovered,” Syrian minister of culture Mohamed al-Ahmad told reporters and visitors, according to Associated Press. “The opening of the museum is a genuine message that Syria is still here and her heritage would not be affected by terrorism.” Much of Syria’s rich cultural history has been destroyed during its civil war. The ancient city of ... The CPTPP is ready for takeoff. The trade deal was recently ratified by Canada, and Australia says it will do the same soon. Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Singapore have already ratified it. With six countries on board, the pact with provisionally go into effect. The CPTPP is the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a similar deal that included the US. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the TPP soon after he was elected. During his presidential campaign, Trump referred to the TPP as the “greatest danger yet” to the US economy, and has declared a preference for bilateral trade ... There’s no foolproof way to know if someone’s verbally telling lies, but scientists have developed a tool that seems remarkably accurate at judging written falsehoods. Using machine learning and text analysis, they’ve been able to identify false robbery reports with such accuracy that the tool is now being rolled out to police stations across Spain. Computer scientists from Cardiff University and Charles III University of Madrid developed the tool, called VeriPol, specifically to focus on robbery reports. In their paper, published in the journal Knowledge-Based Systems earlier this year, th... As details emerge about the horrific shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, Americans are looking for concrete actions they can take to help those who were directly impacted by the event. Here are some ideas: Donate funds You can donate directly to the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh through its website, using a credit card or debit card, or to a number of crowdfunding projects that have been launched, including this verified GoFundMe effort. The money raised will go towards physical repairs to the building and to the survivors and victims’ families. Two Muslim-American educa... Last night (Oct. 27), a helicopter crashed outside the Leicester City soccer team’s stadium in England. According to a report from Reuters, the helicopter was carrying Thai businessman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who is the owner of the Leicester City team. Four other were people on the helicopter, according to Reuters, including Srivaddhanaprabha’s daughter, two pilots, and one person who has not been identified. There has been no confirmation of whether Srivaddhanaprabha and the others died in the crash, but fans have gathered at the stadium to pay their respects. Srivaddhanaprabha is the f... Sometimes it seems like people really suck, to put it bluntly. We struggle with ourselves and others. We don’t handle difficult situations graciously. We’re deceptive, trying to appear generous, nice, and polite to hide mean-spiritedness. And when we aim to please, it’s often out of greed or weakness. But do not despair. There’s a way to discern your own flaws and what makes others monstrous, learn through observation, and turn it all around so that you’re neither awful nor miserable—and neither a pawn in other people’s schemes nor subject to their weaknesses. With this discernment, argues ... One of my favorite anecdotes from a few years back is of the Nairobi Uber driver who asked this New Yorker, “Do they have Uber in the US?” Since then, I’ve encountered many drivers from Lagos to Cape Town and noted how quickly ride-sharing has spread in some of the big African cities, although not without its challenges. It’s also been interesting to see the rapid rise of Airbnb as a much-needed alternative in some of Africa’s largest cities which have a shortage of affordable international standard hotels. Again, what seemed unlikely just a few years earlier has made a notable impact. Uber... This coming Friday (Nov. 2), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is scheduled to hold a major event at the the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It looks like two of WWE’s biggest start won’t be there. According to a report from Newsweek, the wrestlers John Cena and Daniel Bryan are refusing to fight in the Saudi Arabian capital. Their refusal comes after the death of the Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. The Saudi Arabian government claims that Khashoggi was killed in a fistfight, but many observers believe it was a... US president Donald Trump claims to be surprised that anti-Semitism still exists. “This was an anti-Semitic act,” he said after the shooting that killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age.” Such disbelief, from a man who has long usedanti-Semitic code words to fire up his base, defies credibility. It also reflects a widespread tendency to minimize the hatred that Jewish people face. After neo-Nazis marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, shouting, “Jews will not replace us,” there was an unnerving lac... This week Chinese president Xi Jinping ordered the Southern Theatre Command, responsible for monitoring the South China Sea and Taiwan, to boost its military capabilities to prepare for a possible conflict, according to a Hong Kong newspaper. During a visit to the region on Thursday (Oct. 25), Xi said it was necessary to “concentrate preparations for fighting a war,” reported the South China Morning Post, citing a transcript of Xi’s speech from state broadcaster China Central Television.“We need to take all complex situations into consideration and make emergency plans accordingly.” State n... Social isolation takes a heavy toll on those who suffer from it, both in health and overall well-being. An effort to quantify the cost of loneliness in the US also found that among Americans aged 65 or older, social isolation costs the US government nearly $7 billion in additional health care costs per year. People of any age can be socially isolated, of course, but the risk of losing contact with friends, family, and community members becomes greater as a person ages. For some in later life, social networks can shrink after losses and life changes: retirement, the death of friends and love... On Oct. 26, US authorities charged Florida resident Cesar Sayoc with sending 13 explosive devices to prominent public figures, including former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. The internet immediately uncovered Sayoc’s social media accounts, which were promptly suspended. Sayoc’s tweets were a hodgepodge of anti-Democrat memes, and included attacks on many of the folks he targeted: Obama, Clinton, billionaire philanthropist George Soros, representativeDebbie Wasserman Schultz, as well as Oprah Winfrey, former NFL starColin Kaepernick, and Parkland shoot... For a certain segment of the millennial generation, Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” is much more than a catchy tune. The pop anthem came out in 2012, when millennials were in their late teens and early-to-mid 20s, and for over a year, it was inescapable. It played during commutes, parties, and workouts, and, really, everywhere else you went that year. If you’re a millennial, probably can’t help but mentally return to the days when you first heard “Call Me Maybe” when it comes on in 2018. For Gen-Xers, though, Jepsen’s song may be catchy, but it won’t trigger the nostalgia of, say, “Right... When president Emmerson Mnangagwa campaigned in July for Zimbabwe’s presidency, he promised to be a business friendly leader, and to return his country’s economy to twentieth century times of plenty and prosperity. But Mnangagwa has already shown himself incapable of jettisoning the state centrist, rent-seeking predilections of his predecessor. A “big-bang” sharp break with Zimbabwe’s recent past is essential to reassure consumers and capitalists. Yet Mnangagwa and his cronies have so far rejected anything forward-looking and sensible. Mnangagwa’s administration is struggling to overcome th... Witches are having a major moment. As well as this weekend’s release of the witchy horror movie Suspiria, a slew of witch-themed TV reboots are in the works (see: Charmed, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Bewitched). Starbuck’s unveiled its “Witch’s Brew” Halloween frappucino this Halloweeen week. The population of practicing witches and Wiccans in the US has seen an astronomical rise. And social media has conjured up a kind of Instagrammable witchiness that has been identified by market trend-spotters as “mysticore” or “chaos magic.” The modern incarnation of witch culture in the #MeToo era ... What’s a person to do when bad news abounds? Taking to the streets or signing up for a campaign isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. If you’re not the activist type but still want to find a way to help humanity, Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami has a satisfying answer. Speaking at a New Yorker magazine event in New York on Oct. 6, Murakami explained that, in 2011, he was struggling with the question of what to do about others’ suffering, from the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US to people hit by natural disasters in Japan. He concluded that the best he could do was continue to write... When you hear “beauty pageants” you probably think of human women (and men) competing. However, a series of pageants on the Arabian Peninsula celebrate the beauty of the dromedary, or one-humped camel. Interest in camel beauty competitions has grown since the boom of oil production during the 20th century, as camels became associated with status and wealth. These pageants have become massive. In 2017, some 30,000 camels competed in the King Abul Aziz Camel Festival in Saudi Arabia, which has a prize pool of around $32 million. The winners in six categories each get roughly $5.3 million, alo... In the pantheon of flavor, sour is probably the most perpetually underutilized building block to deliciousness, at least in Western kitchens. It’s often what makes the difference been an OK meal and a great one: Good cooks speak of “lightening up” a rich savory dish with a squeeze of lemon or spritz of vinegar, and tartness is often the missing element in overly sweet desserts. That same burst of acidic brightness is as crucial in the cup as it is on the plate. Cocktails missing an acid component read as heavy and flat—which is why bars go through so much citrus. Before lemons and limes wer... Dungeons & Dragons is staging a comeback in the culture it helped create. The ultimate vestige of old-school nerd-dom, D&D was originally published in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was popular well before tabletop games, comics, and computers, and invited players to invent their own worlds of magic and monsters that could change at the players’ whim. More than 40 years later, D&D has one again emerged in pop culture: Actor Joe Manganiello boasts a prodigious D&D cave, Anderson Cooper is obsessed with the game, and D&D underpinned the most recent season of Netflix’s Stranger Things... My sister once tried to distract an angry dragon by inquiring after its relationship with its parents. This move brought equal parts confusion and hilarity to a session of Dungeons & Dragons, the role-playing game my four siblings and I were playing. (D&D created the blueprint nerd culture still follows today.) Most of the year we are rarely in the same continent, let alone the same place, so playing games when we are together is our way of feeling connected and remembering we are a team. Table-top board games affirm human bonds through face-to-face interaction, which is liberating in an ag... A gunman has killed multiple people, and shot at least 12, including three police officers, at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday (Oct. 27). The suspect has been named as 46-year-old Robert Bowers. While we don’t yet know his motives—authorities are treating the attack as a hate crime—we do know that this tragedy is the culmination of years of rising anti-Semitism in the US, both off and online, that has ramped up ahead of the November midterm elections. According to a report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish civil-rights group, the midterm elections have been ... Law enforcement has named 46-year-old Robert Bowers as the man behind a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that left at least four dead and six injured, including four police officers.

You may have never heard of PM2.5. But if you plan to continue breathing, it should at the top of your vocab list. PM2.5 is the technical term for fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. It’s the smallest unit of air pollution, the kind spewed out of wildfires, car exhaust, and power plants that burn fossil fuels. It’s small enough to invade human airways and slip into the bloodstream. Exposure to PM2.5 air pollution has detrimental effects on the heart and lungs. It hits babies and the elderly hardest, and exposure in the womb has long been associated with an... The London Tube has some hot spots. Crowds and increasing temperatures within the underground train system’s cars have led to almost 3,600 instances of fainting—or cases where passengers felt faint—between January 2016 and May 2018. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers referred to the data as “alarming.” Most of the faintings occurred on morning commutes, between 8am and 9am. King’s Cross St. Pancras, the rail network’s busiest station, had over 850 faintings during that 28-month time period, according to the BBC. The stops at Green Park and Liverpool Street had the se...

The long history of US-Saudi relations has had many moments when the US might have struck back at the kingdom. A web of common interests has kept that from happening. By Emily Tamkin Now that Saudi Arabia has conceded that Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's murder was a premeditated plot carried out inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the question becomes how the killing of a permanent US resident by representatives of an allied nation might affect the longterm relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States. If past is prologue, the answer to that question is: not much... "My mom saw my piercings as soon as the X-ray popped up and the doctor and I started laughing hysterically." By Tanya Chen OK, so since you clicked on this story, here's what you need to know: Sydney Allen, 20, of Clearwater, Florida, quietly got her nipples pierced back in June as a birthday gift from her sister. They both decided to keep the piercing a secret, and to definitely keep their parents from knowing. Allen told BuzzFeed News her mom is "a bit conservative on appearances and hates tattoos and piercings." "Since I don't usually have my shirt off I thought it would be a very easy s... A tearful on-air apology and email to staff did little to quell the controversy that even prompted public condemnations from her colleagues. By Michael Blackmon Charles Sykes / AP After little more than a year of failing to live up to ratings expectations amid a raft of on-air stumbles, NBC has canceled Megyn Kelly's morning show just days after her on-air defense of blackface created a crisis at the network. "Megyn Kelly Today is not returning," and NBC spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News Friday. "Next week, the 9 am hour will be hosted by other TODAY co-anchors." Kelly's att... “I see the weapon, and now I'm in fear of my life,” Derek Partee recalled of the encounter. By Otillia Steadman A black Republican campaign volunteer was allegedly threatened and harassed by two white men and a white woman at a polling station in North Carolina on Wednesday. Derek Partee, a retired police detective from Nassau County, New York, wrote on Facebook that the group of harassers “called me a Nigger, Black piece of shit and he exposed his weapon.” “They said something about being a Republican and I said I'm a Republican. 'We don't give a fuck what you are nigger. You want some of ... By Lauren Strapagiel Have we ever stopped to consider what a damn shame it is that most Halloween decorations only go outside? What if you want to bring the spooky indoors? Well great news because it turns out some people put up HALLOWEEN TREES. The images on the van are Republican-leaning, including ones of the GOP logo, Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and another sticker that reads, "CNN SUCKS." By Mary Ann Georgantopoulos WPLG-TV via AP Authorities in Florida have confiscated a white van covered in pro-Trump stickers and decals in connection to the arrest made regarding the suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and critics of the president. The van, which was outside AutoZone in Plantation, Florida, was covered with a blue tarp and towed away. It is unclear if the van belongs to the individual arrested Friday morning... Sayoc was arrested in Plantation, Florida, after a series of 13 pipe bombs were sent to prominent Democrats and critics of the president. By Tasneem Nashrulla and Ellie Hall and Zoe Tillman Authorities arrested a suspect in Florida on Friday in connection with the series of pipe bomb packages addressed to several prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump this week. The suspect was identified as Cesar Altieri Sayoc, a 56-year-old man living in Florida, authorities said. Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts store in Plantation, Florida. At least 13 explosive devices were sent o... The move comes after the company suspended 652 fake pages, groups, and accounts in August for “coordinated, inauthentic behavior” associated with Iranian and Russian political influence operations. By Ryan Mac and Charlie Warzel and Kevin Collier Facebook announced on Friday that it removed 82 groups and accounts for “coordinated inauthentic behavior” originating from Iran that targeted users in the United States and United Kingdom. The company could not find any present ties to the Iranian government and was unable to say who was responsible for the accounts and pages, which posted divisiv... The story was also promoted in a Facebook ad, which is not supposed to happen. By Craig Silverman A Twitter employee has gone viral on the platform after sharing a fake story from a fake news website. Twitter designer Dan Saffer racked up tens of thousands of engagements for a tweet about a hoax story from ThereIsNews.com, a site run by a group based in Spain that call themselves the Comedy Factory. The site's "Legal Warning" describes it as "a humor site whose purpose is entertainment. The content of TIN is fiction and does not correspond to reality." The same group also operates two popul... Sources say both Amazon and Apple are taking retributive measures against the outlet that alleged they were hacked by China. By Joseph Bernstein Amazon pulled its fourth-quarter advertisements from Bloomberg's website, a move some within the media giant think is retribution for Bloomberg's controversial story alleging that Chinese spies hacked into the online retailer's servers. According to a source in a position to know, Amazon's digital media buyer, Initiative, informed Bloomberg's sales staff on Oct. 16 that it would cancel its ad buys for the fourth quarter due to budget cuts.

On Tuesday, Melania Trump invited 30 sixth grade students from Digital Pioneers Academy to join her and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the White House Family Theatre as part of her 'Be Best' campaign in National Bullying Prevention Month. During their visit, she showed the film Wonder, a 2017 movie about a boy with Treacher Collins syndrome, which creates facial deformities, that has an anti-bullying message. A spokesperson for the First Lady told The Hill: The movie celebrates ... Following the news of the horrific shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, a crowdfunding campaign started by two Muslim groups has raised more than $40,000 for the victims. Incredibly, the campaign reached its $25,000 goal in a few short hours and is now nearing $50,000. The fundraising page reads: The Muslim-American community extends its hands to help the shooting victims, whether it is the injured victims or the Jewish families who have lost loved ones. We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. The fundraise... If you thought 2018 would be the year that all white people would realise that darkening their skin to dress as a black person is racist, you’d be wrong. A London tube passenger spotted wearing “blackface” on the tube. The woman can be heard saying “It’s a bit racist that you put black make-up on”, trying to calmly point out the various ethical issues with Halloween costumes like this. When confronted by the passenger, the man shrugged and asked “Why not?” The video was posted to Twitter with the caption “It’s 2018? How is this still happening?” It’s 2018 ? How is this still happening ? pic... Each year when people celebrate Halloween, problematic costumes are a depressingly regular feature. This year, a dad has said he regrets dressing himself and his son in Nazi costumes. A picture of Bryant Goldbach and his son was posted online and has been sparking outrage, with the father dressed as a Nazi and his son as Adolf Hitler. Goldbach says he originally did it for historical purposes but now acknowledges the costume was in poor taste. He said: I think it was in bad taste for me to let my child to wear that, probably for me to wear that. It didn't occur to me. I thought it was a bad... President Trump is known for his weird habits, such as his now legendary sideways handshake. Love him or loathe him, he's never afraid to do things a little - or a lot - differently. In very serious breaking news, it's emerged that the president, the leader of the free world, doesn't seem to know how to use an umbrella. This earth shattering revelation was revealed as Trump boarded the presidential plane, Air Force One. Before entering the aircraft, he paused, before leaving his open umbrella at the door. The umbrella was left, eerily hovering open outside the air craft for all to see. loo... The world is still reeling from the news of the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The aftershocks of the shooting, in which a gunman killed 11 people after shouting that Jews "need to die", have been felt across the world. Unfortunately, with a figure as divisive as president Trump, many Americans are in the position of having a leader who they simply don't trust to act appropriately in important moments such as this. To many, Trump proved this once again as he made a speech to the annual Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis. There had been whispers that his spee... The Vancouver Police Department Canine Unit releases a K9 calendar each year and this installation has not disappointed. These brave four-legged officers are in the calendar in an effort to raise money for cancer research and a local children's hospital. This year, the release of the 2019 calendar is attracting eyeballs (and donations) from around the world. Feast your eyes on these truly good dogs: The 2019 Vancouver Police dog calendar is now for sale. It features members of the @VPDCanine & their four-legged partners in their best poses as they work to keep the city safe. Proceeds from ... Most people know that all art is subjective. But that doesn’t stop everyone from thinking they’re a critic. Recently, Reddit user I-Have-A-Headache got their own share of this irritating part of human nature. After getting back into art after studying biology, the artist became fascinated with exploring the female form. She has shared an exchange with a supposedly refined art collector, who took offence to the subject matter of her work. When he realised a piece of her work featured female masturbation, he continually low-balled her, reducing the price and labelling it “inappropriate”. Dumb... From Hurricane Maria to Charlottesville and high school shootings, president Trump's responses to horrific events have frequently drawn criticism. After the news broke that a gunman had opened fire in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the president's reaction has been widely condemned. If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better That's what the president said after learning about the shooting, in which the gunman allegedly shouted that Jews "need to die". The decision to pander to what is essentially a talking point from the National Rifle Association - that the answer to... Earlier this month Kanye West made headlines around the world following his bizarre meeting with Donald Trump at the White House. He said many odd things during his discussion with the president including rants about 'Superman' and 'hydrogen planes.' It was all very strange and nobody was quite sure what to make of it but despite everyone seemingly having their say no one has heard what his in-laws, the Kardashian's thought. In an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the mother of the family, Kris Jenner attempted to shed some light on how she felt about he son-in-laws controversial sup... Earlier this year The Simpsons was dogged by accusations of perpetuating stereotypes of Indian-Americans in the character of Apu. The convenience store worker had been in the show since 1990 but a failure to progress his characteristics had seen viewers in 2018 brand Apu as racist and problematic. The show and its creators had clumsily tried to address the accusations but now they have seemingly decided that they would rather not engage with any further discussions around Apu by announcing that he will be axed from the show. Speaking to Indie Wire, producer Adi Shankar, who was working on a... Hold the front page! A cat just walked down the catwalk in Turkey - and people can't get enough. Footage has emerged of the sassy feline strutting her stuff on the aptly named 'catwalk' during Esmond International Fashion Show in Istanbul, Turkey, on Friday. Speaking to The Dodo about the unexpected attendant at the show, fashion designer Goksen Hakki Ali commented: Everybody was in shock After footage of the feline was posted onto Instagram, it quickly went viral, with over 100,000 views: View this post on Instagram Ahahahahahah #catwalk #real #vakkoesmod A post shared by H (@hknylcn) on ... A teacher in the US state of Iowa is under investigation after being photographed wearing blackface at a Halloween party. It is thought that Mega Luloff, who is a teacher at Walcott Elementary, was impersonating the character LaFawnduh from the 2004 movie Napoleon Dynamite. In the images which were shared online, the 32-year-old is seen wearing a black wig as well as having black makeup on her arms, face and neck. Her photograph has since been removed from the school's website, while NAACP officials are calling on the Davenport School District administrators to fire the teacher. Betty Andre... On Friday, 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of sending 'explosive devices' to leading Democrats and CNN. A van that belonged to the Florida native was also ceased by the authorities, with the vehicle being adorned in numerous stickers supporting Donald Trump as well as attacking his opponents. Footage of the van began airing on all major news networks but a viral tweet sent by screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer, claimed that Fox News were censoring the stickers during their coverage. Fox News is blurring out the stickers on the van. Fox News is blurring out the stickers on the... Right-wing commentator Candace Owens is being criticised on Twitter after she deleted a tweet promoting a conspiracy theory relating to the recent bomb scares in America. The 29-year-old who can count Kanye West as one of her fans chose to remove a post that she shared on Wednesday claiming that the packages sent to leading Democrats and CNN were not sent by conservatives. She added that she found the fact that the bombs were sent during the midterm elections campaign was 'suspicious.' Picture: Twitter This was before 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc was arrested on the suspicion of mailing at least... The American political commentator Rochelle Ritchie has claimed that Twitter failed to act after she was sent threats by Cesar Sayoc, who has been arrested in connection with the 'explosive devices' sent to critics of Donald Trump this week. Ritchie, who has previously worked as the press secretary for the House Democrats, has stated that she received threatening messages from Sayoc earlier this month, after making an appearance on Fox News on October 2. Although Sayoc's Twitter account has now been suspended, Ritchie had taken screenshots of the messages that he sent to her and in a tweet ... This week numerous 'explosive devices' have been sent to critics of Donald Trump, including Barack Obama, Robert De Niro and Hillary Clinton. In times like this, you would hope that even her strongest of critics would show some sympathy. That wasn't the case at a Republican rally in Wisconsin where crowds chanted "lock her up" just hours after the device was sent to her and Bill Clinton's home in New York. It was a similar sight in the White House on Friday, where young conservative supporters of Trump chanted "CNN sucks" just days after the news network was also a target in the bomb scares... It should come as no surprise to you that being a mother is an extremely difficult and an oftentimes underappreciated job. One woman has decided to literally illustrate her frustrations to show her husband and it's an amazing sight. Meet Mattea Goff, she's married to Kris and they have two children, Seleste, 5, and Aurora, 5 months old. On Thursday 11 October, Mattea was struggling to find the best way to convey how stressed and exhausted she is to her husband, as he was struggling to understand just why she was so cranky in the morning. That's where the idea of drawing the problem came abo... Barack Obama returned to the political arena on Friday to lend his support to Democrats running for office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Speaking to the masses, the former president was on his typical charismatic form and didn't pull any punches when referring to Donald Trump and the Republicans. You may recall an article from the New York Times which was published on Wednesday which claimed that Chinese and Russian spies are routinely eavesdropping in on calls that Trump makes on his iPhone. Trump has already denied this and claimed on Twitter that he only uses government phones and that the ar... At the risk of mansplaining, it's probably a safe bet to say that everyone who experiences periods knows they're not fun. Another thing which is no doubt infuriating is the apparent lack of education, or pure ignorance, when it comes to tampons and female hygiene in general. Half of the world's population needs to use feminine hygiene products a week each month, every single month, for nearly 30 years. Which of course is a pricey bill to foot, considering how these products are inexplicably taxed to hike the price instead of being considered as a basic necessity. One particular story was sh... Avengers 4 is fast approaching and the fan theories just won't stop coming. After Avengers: Infinity War left us with a monster cliffhanger as to the fate of our beloved superheroes and people have been going wild, trying to figure out how the good guys will come back from this and beat Thanos after he wiped out half of the population of the universe. A new fan theory coming out could make a lot of sense and it regards none other than Mr Nick Fury himself. If you recall, in Infinity War before being dissolved into some sort of human dust, Fury sends a message on a mysterious pager-esque dev... President Donald Trump’s presidency has been blighted by serious and chilling blunders. From taking two days to condemn white supremacists following Charlottesville, to mocking alleged sexual assault survivor Dr Christine Blasey Ford, most people would think that there’s no way he could go any lower. But, as has become the norm, they’d be wrong. Following the news that Democratic Party politicians including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, alongside Trump critics including Robert De Niro and news network CNN, were targeted by postal explosives, the president took to Twi... Although most people would like to think that they have empathy for others, it's rare to see acts of compassion actually take place in public. When they actually happen, they are sometimes small favours or acts of solidarity. Other times they can be acts of such heartwarming sensitivity that they leave you speechless. That brings us to this viral story of two men who decided to help out an older woman who they had noticed was paying for the petrol for her car with change. They reached out to her and gave her a handful of cash to make her situation a little easier. The astounded woman breaks... Twitter might have helped to give us president Trump and Brexit, but there’s life in the blue bird yet. Today Channel 4’s official Twitter account has done something than millions of people in the UK would love to do: it told Piers Morgan to “go f*** himself”. Yes, that’s right, in the below tweet, the pioneering TV channel didn’t hold back in letting one of Britain’s most loathed man know how it feels. Dear @PiersMorgan. Hope you're having a wonderful morning. Why don’t you go and f**k yourself. #SU2CRewards, — Channel 4 (@Channel4) October 26, 2018 But all is not quite as it seems. The tw... A 16-year-old black girl has appeared on an episode of the US talk show Dr Phil insisting that she is caucasian. The girl, named Treasure, believes that she is a white person and that she is superior to other black people. She appeared on the show with her mother and brother, who had contacted Dr Phil, in the hope that his expertise in psychology could help her out of fears in regards to her mental well-being. In a clip played before she spoke in front of the live studio audience, Treasure explained why her appearance, specifically citing the natural straightness of her hair, is a key indic... In a time when the news seems bleak, thank goodness for gay penguins. That’s right, the cute-o-meter is about to be broken by the news that same-sex penguin couple, Sphen and Magic, have successfully incubated an egg together at the Sydney aquarium. Apparently this came about after the pair discovered they were "absolute naturals" as parents. The egg was kindly donated by another couple who had one too many. The egg was fostered to Sphen and Magic from another couple who had two, and did not have the resources to look after both 👍 — Sea Life Sydney Aquarium (@Sydney_Aquarium) October 26, 2... As we've documented numerous times on indy100,racism in America is rife and it doesn't appear to be getting any better. Hate speech directed at black people and white people idly calling the police on minorities for absolutely nothing is almost a daily occurrence now. Now it appears that people who aren't white can't even go for a drive in a car with their children without suffering abuse. A video shared by Twitter user Santiago Mayer shows a woman, who is said to be a friend of his mother, being subjected to a string of racist insults and references to her appearance, while waiting at tra... Trans activist and reality star Caitlyn Jenner has ended her support for president Donald Trump over his assault on trans rights. The Olympic gold medalist, who supported Trump over Hillary Clinton and even attended his inauguration ball, said she had "remained hopeful" that she could work with Mr Trump's administration. But in an op-ed for the Washington Post, she admitted that she had got it wrong, admitting her position had been a "mistake". She wrote: The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president. The president has caused international outcry a... Vaccinations seem like a no brainer when it comes to protecting your children from disease, but there are no shortage of debates between anti-vaxxers and rational people in the world. It's such a simple concept that even Benjamin Franklin, who was alive in the 1700s, was a staunch supporter of vaccinations. The founding father lost his son to smallpox in 1736, which caused him to pen a message in support of vaccination, which resonates even now. In the message, he was urging parents to inoculate their children - and despite the underdeveloped and basic science that existed in the 18th centu... Justin Bieber has done a lot of things to upset people, including getting really bad tattoos and telling people not to take photos of him. But people think he's gone too far this time. In the midst of a chaotic week, when he and his new wife Hailey Baldwin were seen arguing in public with her father, Bieber sat down on a park bench and ate a burrito. However, the way he chose to eat the burrito has caused some hysteria online. 'What do you mean?' We hear you ask. Well, take a look at this picture. Justin Bieber eating a burrito sideways. Enough said. Now, we aren't aware of any instruction... The president of Southampton University Students' Union has caused controversy after saying that a “mural of white men”, which pays homage to WW1 heroes, should be painted over. Reported by the BBC, Emily Dawes said on Twitter, in a now-deleted tweet: Mark my words - we're taking down the mural of white men in the uni senate room, even if I have to paint over it myself. The mural in question was painted by Sir William Rothenstein in 1916. It remembers students who lost their lives in the war and were unable to complete their degrees. The mural depicts a fallen soldier collecting his honorar... A 70 year-old man who was filmed racially abusing a passenger aboard a Ryanair flight has broken his silence. David Mesher was filmed calling 77 year-old Delsie Gayle a an “ugly black b******” and telling her not to speak to him in a foreign language on the flight. The footage sparked calls for a boycott of Ryanair after the airline appeared to take little action against Messer. Gayle, who’s husband died not long ago, even had to move seats on the flight from Spain to London. This racist white man refused to sit next to an elderly black woman on a Ryanair flight. He called her an "ugly blac... Michael Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing Stormy Daniels in her bid to sue Donald Trump, managed to put his foot in it on Thursday. Big time. During an interview with Time magazine, the 47-year-old commented on who the Democrats should put forward as their presidential nominee in 2020. Now, there are plenty of good candidates currently working for the Democrats including Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kamala Harris and even, at a stretch, Michelle Obama. If you wanted to go down the celebrity route, you could mention names like Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne Johnson - ... Elon Musk is a 47-year-old South African business magnate, philanthropist, entrepreneur, CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla, and has a net worth of $20.7 billion. Some of his ventures include trying to send humans to Mars, launching a car into space and building a battery that can bower South Australia.

The title of Avengers 4 is being kept as a closely guarded secret, but that hasn't stopped people speculating what it might be. There have been suggestions that it might be called Avengers: End Game,but another title that is being thrown around the internet is Avengers: Annihilation. This may or may not have been the title that Mark Ruffalo revealed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon a few weeks ago, but it's a theory that is gathering speed. Directors Joe & Anthony Russo have stated that the name of the film was not uttered by any characters in Avengers: Infinity War, but it is possibl... Most people will tell you that getting a period isn’t always convenient. Depending on what a person is wearing, leaks can appear. While there’s nothing wrong with this completely normal bodily function, for teenagers it can be particularly uncomfortable. Most of the time, embarrassing period stories normally revolve around a person being the subject of unfair ridicule. It’s certainly rare that teenage boys come to the rescue in tales of awkward periods. But as a recent Reddit post revealed, it does happen. When a male classmate noticed his female peer’s stain on the bus, he did the humane t... Just when you thought you'd seen everything at a wedding, someone manages to go and set fire to the happy couple. Yes, this is the moment two adrenaline junkie brides set their dresses on FIRE after walking down the aisle. April Choi, 32, and Bethany Byrnes, 28, enlisted guests from their wedding parties to torch the gowns while they were still wearing them. Don't worry though, as although the dramatic footage shows flames engulfing their dresses, the garments were specially altered to make the trains detachable Picture: Sherry Schons / SWNS The same-sex couple - who are both variety entert... Most parents will have a moment in their lives when they will have to tackle playground bullies making their kids unhappy. More often than not, a stern talking to with parents can sort out problems, but sometimes it takes a different tactic – as one Houston dad recently found out. Too often, the cycle of abuse repeats itself. Hurt people deal with their emotions by bullying others. This is why, when Aubrey Fontenot heard his eight-year-old son Jordan was getting bullied by another boy at school named Tamarion, he decided to empathise After receiving permission from the supposed bully’s fami... This might come as a shock to you but Donald Trump supporters aren't big fans of his former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Yet, you would hope that on the day an explosive device was sent to her and Bill Clinton's home in Chappaqua, New York, they might show a little compasion. After all, an assassination attempt is nothing to laugh at. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case. At least not at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, where Trump devotees revived the old chant of "lock her up" as senator Leah Vukmir delivered a speech. Tonight: Trump crowd chants "lock her up" after bomb maile... On 23 October, Hollywood A-lister and expert troller Ryan Reynolds celebrated his 42nd birthday. While you sit there and wonder how someone could possibly look that good at that age, allow us to distract you from a mini-crisis of confidence with a small scrap between Deadpool and Wolverine. Well, not exactly the two superheroes, but the actors who play them - Mr Reynolds and Mr Hugh Jackman respectively. On the day of Reynolds' birth, Jackman wished him many happy returns on Twitter, but not before giving him a little dig about which of them is the nicest of the two. Because I’m told that I... Rami Malek has stepped into the shoes of pop icon and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury for his latest on-screen role. But Bohemian Rhapsody has so far been plagued by controversy. After trailers emerged, the film faced criticism as it appeared to erase the AIDS crisis and Mercury’s sexuality. Director Brian Singer has also faced allegations of sexual abuse in recent years, which he strongly denies. Given the negative vibes surrounding the film, you’d think its actors would be poised to put this right during their promotional appearances. However, the promo tour appears to have gotten off to a... The US midterm elections are just around the corner and, as always, their political debates are beginning to heat up, with jibes aplenty being thrown around. We've already seen some pretty outrageous stuff so far, including the campaign ad from David Brill, which featured possibly the best twist of all-time. Now we have probably the quickest takedown of a politician by an opponent when Florida gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis squared off. A particularly tense moment in the debate occurred when DeSantis was asked about his connections to David Horowitz, a radical conse... Chelsea Handler is known for her epic putdowns and super quick wit. But the comedian is now using her platform to address an important and serious cultural issue: white privilege. Handler stopped by Ellen to promote a new project with Netflix that explores her privilege as a white woman. She described to host Ellen DeGeneres how, following the 2016 presidential election, she began reading texts by black authors and exploring the benefits that her white skin has given her. She told DeGeneres how this made her “feel gross”, before discussing her discomfort at the fact that 53 per cent of whit... Following the discovery of the bombs sent to the homes of Barack Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton, as well as the New York office of CNN, you would expect a strongly worded statement from Donald Trump on Twitter. After all, it's not like he's ever lost for words on the website. Yet before the president could release his statement, his vice president Mike Pence sent out this tweet condemning the attempted attacks. We condemn the attempted attacks against fmr Pres Obama, the Clintons, @CNN & others. These cowardly actions are despicable & have no place in this Country. Grateful for swift r... The volatility and division of American politics has reached disturbing new lows, with packages allegedly containing explosives being sent to president Obama, George Soros, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and the offices of news network CNN. Of course, given president Trump’s frequent attacks on the recipients of the devices, people are assuming the explosives were sent by someone who thinks they are working in his best interests. Whether it's "lock her up" chants about Hillary Clinton, taking two days to condemn white supremacists who murdered a woman in Charlottesville, praising a Montana congr... Yesterday, a series of explosive devices and suspicious packages were discovered at homes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as the New York offices of CNN. A similar device was also found at the home of billionaire philanthropist George Soros and other leading Democrats. The FBI is searching for suspects and have warned that other packages may still be undiscovered. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has labelled these attempts as "an act of terror" and, while it was fortunate that nobody was hurt, it does bring into further question the rhetoric that Donald Trump has promoted as... Yesterday, Tommy Robinson, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, walked free from court after his contempt case was referred to the attorney by a judge at the Old Bailey. The 35-year-old far-right 'journalist' has become something of a figurehead in recent months for those that agree with his politics, many of whom waited outside the court and cheered when the outcome was confirmed. Robinson, who is the founder and former leader of the English Defence League, had been imprisoned in August for breaking reporting restrictions at Leeds Crown Court in May where the Huddersfield grooming gang were on trial... It’s as bad as it sounds. A white couple decided to create a weird photo shoot for their wedding, complete with fake Congolese militia. The bizarre photos feature a white bride in a whole host of awkward poses including being held at gunpoint by a black soldier and walking down a dirt road with little black children following. Another had the bride standing in front of a crowd of Congolese adults and children with the caption: “Just cruising thru the ghetto in Congo in a wedding dress." A different photo has a close up shot of what looks like her diamond wedding ring curled around an AK47 w... U2 aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea but you've got to hand it to Bono and his commitment to promoting his own ego. The Irish rockers aren't strangers to making political statements either and, at a concert in London on Tuesday night, Bono decided to share his thoughts on Brexit. Before they played the topical song 'Get Out Of Your Own Way,' Bono opted to address the crowd at the 02 Arena and share his thoughts on Britain's decision to leave the EU. The 58-year-old said: We’ve just been touring all across Europe and whatever you think about it, all we heard about from Madrid to Berlin to... A doctor in America shared the reason why he always tries to find the Facebook profile of a recently deceased patient - and it'll pluck at your heartstrings. Doctor Louis M Profeta, an emergency physician at St Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, says he checks the profiles of those who have died so he can remain compassionate when he breaks the devastating news to their loved ones.

News has dropped of a well-known businessman who has successfully filed an injunction against a newspaper to prevent it from reporting allegations of sexual and racial abuse of staff members at his British companies. After an eight-month investigation into the ‘bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman’, The Telegraph was prevented from revealing details about the person in question thanks to a so called 'gag order'. Five employees of companies that the unnamed person owns, referred to only as 'ABC' in court documents, came forward with allegations of ‘discre... Nobody should ever have to celebrate their birthday alone, but that's sadly what happened to one unlucky boy in Tucson, Arizona. Six-year-old Teddy was hoping to spend his special day with 32 of his schoolmates at a Peter Piper Pizza restaurant, but not a single one turned up. His mother, Sil Mazzini, had already been told by a few parents that their children wouldn't be able to attend, but the sight of Teddy sitting by himself on a huge table is enough to break even the coldest of hearts. Mazzini sent the picture to local journalist Nick VinZant who asked the folks on Facebook to make Tedd... A five-year-old-boy was bullied for wearing red nail varnish, so his big brother and dad decided to paint their nails too. Aaron Gouveia’s son Sam likes wearing nail varnish and had been wearing it for a while, until one day in school when he was bullied for it. In tears, he came home and wanted to take it off, and that’s when his father talked to him about it. The former journalist, who has a Twitter account called Daddy Files, recalled the story on the social media platform. He began: "Sam is my middle child & he’s a terror. A 'boy’s boy' as so many (not me) would say. He’s rough and tumb... We haven't even seen the trailer or know anything about Avengers 4, but it's safe to assume one thing: Chris Evans will no longer be Captain America. A few weeks ago, the 37-year-old posted an emotional tweet hinting that his time as the super soldier had come to an end, following the conclusion of filming on the next Avengers movies. Officially wrapped on Avengers 4. It was an emotional day to say the least. Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor. To everyone in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in the audience, thank you for the memories! Eternally grateful. —... In the lead up to Halloween, Megyn Kelly had a segment on her 'Today' show on which she posed the following question: What’s wrong with blackface? During the segment, titled ‘Halloween Costume Crackdown', the NBC show host conversed with fellow journalist Jenna Bush Hager, NBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff and Melissa Rivers about donning blackface for Halloween. The entire panel was white. "What is racist?" Kelly quipped. When I was a kid, that [blackface] was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character. The rest of the panel attempted to softly explain why wearing blackface i... This is probably the most unlikely description of a suspect that you'll ever read, but a man barring a resemblance to 'Ross from Friends' is wanted by Blackpool Police. That's right a Ross Geller lookalike - or, should we say, David Schwimmer lookalike - is wanted in connection with a theft from a Blackpool-based restaurant on 20 September. Almost as soon as this CCTV picture was posted of the man, everyone began to notice his striking resemblance to the 51-year-old actor who starred in Friends between 1994 and 2004. that’s ross gellar, sir pic.twitter.com/xbahPYb4wh — 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚... Business and technology entrepreneur and Brexit supporter, Sir James Dyson, has confirmed that his forthcoming electric cars will be built in a new manufacturing facility. In a beautiful bit of irony, this factory won't be in Britain. It won't even be in Europe. It's being built in Singapore, a decision based on the Asian nation's geographical location to "high growth markets". Dyson, best known for their bag-less vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, has confirmed that the facility will be ready by 2020. Chief executive Jim Rowan said in a memo to staff: Dyson's growing automotive team is maki... Kendall Jenner’s latest Vogue cover has landed in her in the middle of a cultural appropriation row, prompting the magazine to apologise for styling her hair in an ‘afro’ way. The November 2018 issue of the fashion magazine shows the 22-year-old model in a cream and white patterned dress, with her hair styled in a big brushed-backwards way, reminiscent of the 1960s. Critics argue that a white model should not be modelling a black hairstyle.

The human brain is an incredible instrument – our most powerful organ. Being able to process information unlike other species has allowed us to build civilisations across the world and even take our first forays into space. But that doesn’t mean our brains are always on point. Regardless of how clever we are, we all get confused sometimes over things that seem easy. Optical illusions – such as “the dress” – are a perfect example of this. Another famous optical illusion, entitled “My Wife and My Mother-in-Law” can supposedly reveal how old a person is. In the photo, people can either see a y... Melania Trump's communications director Stephanie Grisham is calling for a boycott of the rapper TI after he released a steamy new promo video featuring a fake Melania stripping off in the Oval Office.

Another day, another misguided tweet from someone in the British media. Following the protests in London for a second referendum on the UK’s relationship with the European Union – supported by the Independent as part of its Final Say campaign – Twitter has been flooded with opinions on the biggest peaceful protest since the Iraq war marches. Presenter and columnist Adam Boulton has put his foot in it, with a tweet that many people interpreted as encouraging riots. Stop the War, Countryside Alliance, Trump, People’s Vote massive marches don’t change government policy. Riots do. — Adam Boulto... If you'd like to see the reality of how Donald Trump's poisonous politics are impacting people's day-to-day lives, then sadly you won't have to look too far. A woman was been groped on a Southwest Airlines flight from Houston to Albuquerque on Sunday by a man who reportedly invoked the fact that Donald Trump 'gropes' women as his defence. The woman, only described in the complaint as C.W, said she was asleep in her seat when she felt her 'clothes move', and a hand touching her from behind along the 'bra line'. Federal prosecutors say that the man was 49-year-old Bruce Michael Alexander fro... Far-right Tommy Robinson supporters couldn’t get any weirder, surely? Well, unfortunately for everyone with a working brain and a pair of ears, this assumption is false. On the heels of Robinson’s latest court battle, his supporters have written a song – to the tune of Leonard Cohen’s 'Hallelujah' – which celebrates Robinson. It was tweeted by Ezra Levant, a Canadian Robinson fan who associates closely with fellow anti-Islam and anti-immigrant cheerleader Katie Hopkins after she was fired from consecutive media platforms in the UK. Tommy Robinson fans: You are all Snowflake cucks Also Tommy... The Trump administration gets scarier by the day. And the president's latest admission is no less terrifying - he's nailed his colours to the mast and said that he's a 'nationalist'. Speaking to the packed out rally in Houston, Texas, ahead of the midterms and to support the Republican candidate Ted Cruz, he said: A globalist is a person who wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what, we can't have that. ... You know what I am? I’m a nationalist. Use that word. The crowd reportedly broke out into choruses of 'USA' in response. Nationalism h... Animal rights charity PETA are no stranger to fanning the flames of controversy to prove a point. The latest dispute to engulf the organisation relates to milk, the dairy industry and white supremacy - we bet that’s not how you expected that sentence to end. PETA tweeted a link to an article entitled “What does drinking milk have to do with white supremacy?” The link was accompanied by the quote “Cows’ milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists. One more reason to #DitchDairy”. Cows' milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists. One more reason to #DitchDairy. https://... Remembrance Day is nearly upon us, and millions of people across the country will be choosing to wear red poppies on their clothes as a symbol of respect for the military personnel who have sacrificed their lives in conflicts. The red remembrance poppy is an artificial flower that's been used since 1921 to commemorate those who died fighting in the war, and in the run up to Remembrance Day on 11 November, someone in Sailsbury has thought it's appropriate to create a Christmas tree out of them. Taking to Twitter, BBC Wiltshire posted a photograph of the tree, accompanied by the caption: Pop... It's sad isn't it, you know, when you can no longer be racist, homophobic, transphobic, or misogynist in public without being blasted by the 'PC police'? Well, the latest victim of this seems to be that 'sexist' advertising campaign for Yorkie, the chocolate bar, that stated "it's not for girls". Earlier this month, Kleenex announced that it would be changing the branding of its tissues from 'Mansize' to 'Extra Large' after a barrage of complaints that the branding was 'sexist'. Taking to Twitter to reveal the change, Kleenex tweeted: We recently made changes to our Mansize branding and wi... Another day, another disturbing video clip from Trump’s America. Hot off the heels of the Trump administration’s reported plans to legislate trans identities out of existence, his supporters are still as besotted with him as ever before. But a new clip, tweeted by a US journalist, displays the startling loyalty of Trump’s supporters. When a journalist asked MAGA hat-wearers at a Trump rally which topics they were excited to hear the president talk about, their answer was astonishing. They responded: It doesn’t matter what he says, we’ll support it. What do you want to hear Trump talk about?... Former Tory MP Stewart Jackson has provoked outrage after he called the stepfather of a sick child 'a pathetic cretin' on Twitter. The ex-Peterborough MP, and former chief of staff for David Davis while he was Brexit Secretary, was responding to a Twitter user who had posted a photograph of his ill stepson in a hospital bed, draped in the EU flag.

We've all been there - we're in a heated row with our partner, or they're making more and more demands on us, and we quite simply would love to just not respond to them and look the other way.

According to a new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers have argued that there are certain times in lower income relationships when ignoring your spouse's demands is the right thing to do. Lead author Jaclyn M. Ross said in a statement: Consider this example: A wife requests that her husband ask for a raise at wor... Although it is often unavoidable, the thought of using a public toilet is enough to give some people sleepless nights. For some people, one of the ways of getting around this potential exposure to god knows how many germs, is to line the seat with toilet paper. However, an expert has stated that doing this might not be the best idea as you could be putting yourself at risk to even more bacteria. You're probably asking 'How is this possible?' Surely paper can't possibly carry as many germs as a dirty toilet seat? Well, according to Dr Philip Tierno, the way toilet seats are designed means th... Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have a chequered past, to put it mildly. Now, the president has come up with a catchy new nickname for his one-time rival: 'Beautiful Ted'. Trump shared his new nickname for the Texas senator with reporters as he headed to Houston to support the Republican in his efforts of re-election in the midterms. Speaking to ABC News chief Jonathan Carl, he said: To me, he's not 'Lyin' Ted' anymore—he's 'Beautiful Ted '. He then added: I call him 'Texas Ted'.

Depending on your political viewpoint, Caitlyn Jenner’s politics is either her strong point or her weak spot. But either way, her political beliefs are complex to say the least. After supporting Donald Trump in the 2016 election, even after he called Mexicans “rapists”, mocked a disabled reporter and was heard bragging about touching women without their consent, it seems Jenner has finally hit her limit. On her reality show, Jenner even said she thought Trump would be good for women’s issues. But as the penny has started to drop, Jenner has changed her tone. She recently stated that Trump h... That's a lot of water. A spectacular video shows the moment 450,000 gallons of water is released onto a rocket launch pad in order to cool it down after a rocket launch.

They call it the 'Ignition Overpressure Protection and Sound Suppression water deluge system' and it shot the water 100 feet into the air. The goal of this release is to reduce the extreme amount of hear and energy that becomes generated by a rocket launch. Nasa said: The test is part of preparation for la... A white woman has been filmed racially abusing a family from Guatemala in a Virginia restaurant, demanding that they speak Spanish. The family who was visiting a relative in the state were approached by the unnamed woman in a branch of Andy's restaurant in Lovettsville, Virginia, where she demanded to see their passports. In a video, the woman can be seen shouting at the family and demanding that they stop speaking Spanish as it is 'disrespectful' to speak another language in the US. The family, who have asked to remain anonymous were quoted as saying by NBC Washington: She asked for passp... In financially uncertain times such as these, it always feels like the good guys are the ones who bare the brunt.

It's not every day that you get into a fight with a shark and live to tell the story but that's exactly what a man from Australia did last week. 51-year-old Paul Kenny was enjoying a spot of Saturday morning surfing at a nudist spot at Samurai Beach in Port Stephens, New South Wales when a shark latched onto his arm. The miner of Bateau Bay received 20 stitches in his right bicep from what he suspects was a bronze whaler shark. However, the confrontation appears to have been started by Kenny, after he accidentally headbutted the animal. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, he said: I went...

The woman, has has not been identified, was caught on camera spouting racial insults at two men of colour outside a bar in Missouri.

The Trump administration is looking into a law that would effectively erase recognition of trans and nonbinary gender identities, according to the New York Times. The memo being circulated says the Department of Health and Human Services would make changes to Title XI definitions of gender, to only recognise male and female sex, ignoring any other identity. The effects of such a policy would be utterly devastating to over 1 million Americans as it would seek to eradicates the identities of those whom identify as transgender, while also strictly defining gender as 'unchangeable'. In response... This year has seen several US politicians confronted in public due to their association with the Trump administration. Both Sarah Sanders and Scott Pruitt have been accosted by members of the public and now we can add Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to that list.

There were also threats of physical abuse. This racist white man refused to sit next to an... The Trump administration is considering stripping transgender and nonbinary people of official recognition by defining gender as determined by genitalia at birth. According to a report by the New York Times, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently circulating a memo that would set up a strict, legal definition of sex under the federal law that states no citizen can be discriminated against on their gender, which is assigned at birth. The law could impact the lives of 1.4 million transgender and nonbinary Americans as it effectively eradicates the identities of those whom id... There’s few things children love more than toys.

In an article, she explains how she got "fed up" of cleaning and re-arranging her children’s stuff, so she packed them all up and threw them away.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By Campbell Robertson, Sabrina Tavernise and Sandra E. Garcia PITTSBURGH — After walking into Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue and shooting 11 congregants, the authorities say, Robert Bowers turned his weapons on the police. Barricading himself on an upper floor, Mr. Bowers engaged in a desperate shootout that left him and four police officers wounded. When the police finally took him into custody and his wounds were being treated, Mr. Bowers told a SWAT team officer that he “wanted all Jews to die,” according to a criminal complaint filed in the case, because of his belief that Jews “were committing genocide against his people.” A picture was beginning to emerge on Sunday of Mr. Bowers, whom federal officials charged with 29 criminal counts, included obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs — a hate crime, which can carry the death penalty. He also faces state charges. Saturday’s synagogue massacre — the worst in the Jewish community in the United States in decades — has shaken the nation at the end of an exhausting and bitter political season. Here in Pittsburgh, it broke the heart, but not the spirit, of a vibrant Jewish community — the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, where residents grieved for the victims on Sunday. “It’s beyond terrible,” said Carl Solomon, 81, who was on his way to shul at New Light Congregation on Saturday morning when he saw a police officer with a rifle exit a car. Three congregations — Tree of Life, Dor Hadash and New Light — were all holding services in the building at the time of the shooting. [Read more about the shooting suspect, who frequently reposted anti-Semitic content on social media.] Mayor Bill Peduto called the attack the “darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history” but vowed that the city would move forward. “We know that we as a society are better than this,” he said. “We know that hatred will never win out, that those that try to divide us because of the way we pray, or where our families are from around the world, will lose.” The dead included eight men and three women, the authorities said. The oldest victim, Rose Mallinger of Squirrel Hill, was 97. Two brothers, David and Cecil Rosenthal, ages 54 and 59, were the youngest. A husband and wife, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, ages 84 and 86, of Wilkinsburg, Pa., were also among the dead. All were beloved members of the community. Rabbi Donni Aaron, who held musical services at Dor Hadash for years, described Cecil Rosenthal as a tall, kind man who had developmental disabilities and was well-known in Squirrel Hill for his sunny disposition. She said he attended art classes for children at the Jewish Community Center. “He was murdered because he was Jewish,” she said. “He was murdered because he was a big target, and maybe because when everyone hit the deck he might not have right away.” For Mr. Bowers, anti-Semitism appeared to run deep: Before it was deleted Saturday morning, a social media account believed to belong to him was filled with anti-Jewish slurs and references to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. The suspected gunman had 21 guns registered to his name, officials said, including an AR-15-style assault rifle and three Glock handguns, which he brought to the synagogue on Saturday. He had no criminal record, authorities said, and seems to have acted alone. He lived a 30-minute drive south of Squirrel Hill in Baldwin Borough, a hilly, middle-class neighborhood that is part of metropolitan Pittsburgh. The police searched his apartment on Saturday, but by Sunday morning, there were no more signs of police or F.B.I. activity. A neighbor, Kerri Owens, 30, said he had described himself as a truck driver. The massacre moved the world. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square, denouncing the “inhuman act of violence” and praying for an end to the “flames of hatred” that fueled it. President Trump ordered flags to fly at half-mast, after returning to Washington from Illinois on Saturday night. Addressing reporters at Joint Base Andrews on Saturday, Mr. Trump said, “It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done.” The New Light Congregation, Mr. Solomon said, could best be described as “conservative egalitarian.” It was founded in another part of the city around the turn of the 20th century by Romanian Jews fleeing oppression in Europe. In 1957, the synagogue moved to Squirrel Hill; it just recently had moved in with the two other congregations that met separately at Tree of Life. The congregation met downstairs in what is formally called the New Light Chapel, a basement area that its members used as a sanctuary. On a typical Shabbat, about 20 people would show up to worship, Mr. Solomon said, and many of those would trickle in late. On Saturday morning, Mr. Solomon said, repeating what he had been told by survivors of the shooting, only six had arrived by the time services were scheduled to begin. Two of them, Richard Gottfried, 65, and Daniel Stein, 71, were in the kitchen, next to where the shooting was happening. Both were killed. “There is no place to hide in the kitchen,” said Stephen Cohen, 69, the co-president of the congregation. Three people — Dr. Gottfried’s sister, Melvin Wax and Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of the New Light Congregation — were in the chapel when they heard gunshots, Mr. Solomon said. They quickly took refuge in what he called “a storage room” behind the sanctuary. There they hid, with the lights off. It grew quiet again. “Basically everyone froze except for Rabbi Perlman,” Mr. Cohen said. “He shepherded everybody into the back.” They stayed in the storage area, waiting. The noise died down. But Mr. Wax, 88, chose to go out, Mr. Solomon said, possibly because he was hard of hearing. “For whatever reason, Mr. Wax opened the door and got shot,” Mr. Cohen said. He fell back into another man’s arms. They waited like that until the police arrived. Mr. Wax was killed, but the two who remained behind in the storage area survived. “It was actually not very long,” he said. “This whole thing went down relatively fast.” Others inside the building remembered being startled by a loud noise. Joseph Charney, 90, a congregant at the Tree of Life synagogue since 1955, said he was standing in front of a woman who was reading to the congregation and next to his rabbi when they heard what he thought was furniture falling. “We thought it was something outside, like something was falling off a shelf or something,” Mr. Charney said on Sunday. It was not until Mr. Bowers walked into their congregation that they understood what was happening. “As soon as I realized what it was, it was get out of there or die,” Mr. Charney said. He saw Mr. Bowers shoot four people, and ran away quickly. “I saw a big gun, I only looked at him for a couple of seconds and I put two and two together,” Mr. Charney said. Mr. Charney said he and the woman who had been reading scurried to a space on the third floor where “there are places to hide because they are small.” He stood there with the woman, thinking of two things: “Keep your mouth shut and don’t breathe. It was very difficult.” Mr. Charney and the woman were led out of the synagogue by police officers about 30 minutes later, he said. “I watched four people being shot,” Mr. Charney said. “They are regulars, they are there every Saturday. It was awful.” Witnesses in the neighborhood said the attack unfolded without warning. Jim Waite, who lives across the street from the synagogue, said he heard a series of loud pops and went outside to investigate. At that point, a police car came screeching by, and Mr. Waite saw another police officer with his weapon drawn. Then he heard the sounds of chaos: eight or nine more loud pops and screams coming from inside the synagogue. He rushed back into his house, joined by a jogger and his daughter, and they all crouched down, wondering what was going on. “It was truly like a surreal moment,” Mr. Waite said in an interview Sunday morning. “I obviously immediately felt this gut-wrenching kind of panic, and it hasn’t left yet.” From the windows of his house, he saw two police snipers stalking through his front yard and crouched behind a tree, pointing their weapons toward the synagogue, and people running down the street. “For a long time I didn’t look out the window; I was afraid,” Mr. Waite said. The officers who rushed to the scene came upon Mr. Bowers as he was trying to leave the synagogue. He fired at them, injuring one officer in the hand, according to the criminal complaint. Another officer had injuries to his face from shrapnel and broken glass. Mr. Bowers then darted back inside and ran up to the third floor. At that point, a SWAT team went in and came upon the scene of the massacre. Two people were still alive and the police carried them out. As they were searching for other victims, SWAT officers encountered Mr. Bowers, who fired at them and critically injured two officers. The remaining officers “engaged the suspect in a gun battle in which multiple rounds were exchanged,” the criminal complaint said. At some point in the shootout, Mr. Bowers was wounded, and he eventually surrendered to the police. Mr. Bowers remained under guard in the hospital Sunday morning after having surgery, authorities said. He was scheduled to make his first appearance before a federal judge on Monday at 1:30 p.m. [From a Texas church to a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, houses of worship have become sites of mass shootings.] The attack was one of the worst against the Jewish community in the United States in decades, and came just days after George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and major donor to Democratic candidates — who is Jewish, and survived Nazi occupation in Hungary — received a pipe bomb in the mail. A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League said that before Saturday’s shooting, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent United States history was in 1985, when a man killed a family of four in Seattle. He had mistakenly thought they were Jewish. There was also an attack by a white supremacist on a Jewish Community Center filled with children in Los Angeles in 1999 that injured five; a postal carrier was killed a short time later by the gunman. More recently, in 2014, a white supremacist opened fire outside a Jewish Community Center in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., killing three people. According to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since it began tracking such crimes in 1979. Campbell Robertson reported from Pittsburgh, and Sabrina Tavernise and Sandra E. Garcia from New York. Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting.     Advertisement

The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 7 a.m. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a tribute to the Jewish community of Pittsburgh following Saturday’s mass murder at a Pennsylvania synagogue, allegedly by a gunman who expressed hatred of Jews as he opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and later told police, “All these Jews need to die.” The suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue repeatedly expressed anti-Semitic views as he traded gunfire with responding officers, at one point flatly stating: "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit made public Sunday.

---split---6.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/pittsburgh-synagogue-alleged-mass-shooter-told-swat-officers/story?id=58803485---split---The man who allegedly gunned down 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue used three handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle in the 20-minute rampage and screamed to SWAT officers who wounded him in a shootout that he wanted "all Jews to die," authorities said on Sunday. Robert Gregory Bowers, the suspect in the latest mass shooting in America, allegedly acted alone in the Saturday morning massacre at the Tree of Life temple, bursting into Shabbat services with guns blazing and killing three women and eight men, while injuring six others, including four police officers, officials said. During a news conference Sunday morning, the names of the dead were released. They ranged in age from 54 to 97, and included two brothers, a married couple and a family physician. All the victims were from the Pittsburgh area. Dr. Karl Williams, the Allegheny County medical examiner, read the names of the victims: Joyce Fienberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69.   Also killed were brothers Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54; and Bernice Simon, 84, and her husband, Sylvan Simon, 86.   Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, remained in fair condition and under guard on Sunday in a Pittsburgh hospital. He is scheduled to make his first appearance in federal court at 1:30 p.m. on Monday.  Investigators said that minutes before carrying out the carnage, Bowers is believed to have posted his intent to commit the massacre on the social media platform Gab, which is popular with white supremacists and the alt-right. "Screw the optics, I'm going in," reads a post believed to have been made by Bowers moments before the first gunshots were fired inside the temple. Bowers was charged late Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. "Each count is punishable by death," Scott Brady, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said at Sunday's news conference.   Bob Jones, the special agent in charge of the FBI Pittsburgh office, said Bowers allegedly used three Glock 357 handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle in the massacre. "All the weapons he brought into the facility were used," Jones said. Brady added that during the course of the deadly assault, "Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people." Jones said Bowers roamed the sprawling temple in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood to kill victims.  Three services were occurring simultaneously at the temple at the time of the rampage and Jones said bodies were found in three different locations of the synagogue. The first shots were fired about 9:45 a.m. and calls went out to emergency medical services at 9:54 a.m. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was officiating one of the services when the shooting broke out. He told ABC News on Sunday that for about 20 seconds he wasn't sure what was happening.   Myers immediately called 911 as another rabbi huddled with congregants in a cloakroom. He said he was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher being the "eyes and ears" for the police as they rushed to the scene. He declined further comment, saying, "I have seven funerals to plan for tomorrow." Officers raced to the synagogue and encountered Bowers as he was exiting the building and a gun battle ensued, authorities said. Bowers retreated back into the temple and went to the third floor, according to the criminal complaint filed against him.     "SWAT operators entered the third floor of the building. While searching for any remaining victims SWAT operators encountered Bowers, who opened fire on the officers," according to the complaint. During the gunfight, two officers were shot multiple times by Bowers. Two other officers were injured by flying glass or bullet fragments in the encounter, authorities said.   During the exchange of gunfire, Bowers was shot several times and taken into custody, according to the complaint. As Bowers was being treated at the scene, he blurted out a statement to SWAT Officer David Blahut, saying, "He wanted all Jews to die and also that they (Jews) were committing genocide to his people," according to the criminal complaint. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, according to Jones. Investigators suspect he acted alone, Jones said.   In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.   Some of the congregants were gathering for a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue which had not yet started when the massacre began to unfold. No children were among those injured, authorities said.  Five victims remained hospitalized Sunday evening, including two in critical condition, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He said the two in critical condition were a 40-year-old SWAT team member and a 70-year old man who is the chaplain at UPMC-Presbyterian. Dr. Leonard Weiss, assistant EMS medical director for the city of Pittsburgh, lives next door to the synagogue and told ABC News on Sunday that the gunfire woke him up. "I started hearing yelling. Then I realized it was very close by," Weiss said. "My first thoughts were to get safe. But I knew that my role with the city and my role in my job is to find out what's going on and respond." He said he called the emergency dispatch center to find out where the staging area was, then alerted his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center of the alarming situation. "Then I dressed up. I got as much equipment as I could together, and put my boots on and I went outside," Weiss said. "I immediately was suspicious when I heard the gunfire that there would be several casualties. It took a long time for the scene to get safe and for us to get a specific count on who was injured." He said police officers escorted him to the staging area, where he helped direct ambulances to the scene and paramedics to the scene. He recalled checking on one victim with a bullet wound who was being rushed to the hospital in bad shape. He said that once the gunfire subsided and the wounded had been removed from the synagogue, he went to the threshold of the temple and looked in. "I saw several damaged windows. I could see a lot of upsetting things in the chapel that was beyond that threshold," he said. "I was able to visualize some of the victims who lost their lives.   "I felt very emotional," he said. "I felt scared for myself and for my family and my neighbors. I felt scared for my city that it could happen here. And, [I] felt especially proud and worried about my colleague paramedics that risked their lives to go right in and pull people out while the action was unfolding." He said it wasn't until Sunday morning that he heard one of the victims killed was Rabinowitz, a family physician and colleague at the UPMC Shadyside Hospital.  Kim and Ken Hardin, who live across the street from the synagogue, said they heard the shots and quickly ushered their children and a friend of theirs into the basement and away from windows. "We heard five repetitive shots. I stepped out on my porch and I heard three additional shots and within minutes police started to arrive," Ken Hardin told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Sunday. "Police started to park in front of our house. They were shielding themselves with their car. So we realized the situation was pretty serious." He said five officers knocked on his back door and asked to use their second floor to position snipers. "The five police officers went upstairs, asked that I open the windows in our bedroom and obtain a chest-high dresser," Ken Hardin said. "So I found one in my son's room. A police officer and I took the drawers out and dragged the dresser right in front of the window and they perched their rifles on top of the dresser toward the synagogue." Kim Hardin added: "We did see shooting taking place. Our youngest son said that he saw a police officer get shot. I don't know whether or not that he did. It was certainly traumatic for a 10-year-old to see police with so many weapons and to hear the gunfire."  The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement.   First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, Brady said. "They are truly heroes, who without hesitation, without concern for their safety ran toward gunfire to protect innocent victims. By confronting and neutralizing Bowers, they prevented additional loss of life," Brady said. The shooting rattled nerves across the country and globe and prompted an outpouring of support and condolences. In New York, the Empire State Building went dark except for an orange halo on the mast to honor the victims. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower also went dark in homage to the victims. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the city of Pittsburgh will stand by the victims' families and help them get through the tragedy. "Pittsburgh is a strong town. We are a resilient city," Peduto said at Sunday's news conference. "We'll get through this darkest day in Pittsburgh's history by working together."

New details have surfaced from the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting police released scanner audio from the tragic event; Jacqui Heinrich reports. Pittsburgh's professional sports franchises honored the victims of Saturday's deadly mass shooting at a synagogue with a moment of silence and plans for a blood drive and donation collection. The victims of the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh included a grandfather, husband and wife, and two brothers, officials and family members revealed as new details about the alleged gunman behind the deadly rampage were released Sunday. Suspect posted hate speech on the internet before the attack in Pittsburgh. The chairs of both the Democratic and Republican House campaign arms on Sunday called for unity in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, and said the recent bout of violence should not be politicized in the final days ahead of November’s midterm elections. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said Sunday that while President Trump needs to more clear and less caustic in his language, he doesn’t believe there is any connection between the president’s rhetoric and Saturday’s mass shooting in Pittsburgh. Authorities believe alleged gunman Robert Bowers acted alone and was driven by his hatred of Jews; David Lee Miller reports from Pittsburgh on what more is being learned about the suspect. In the wake of the tragic mass shooting at synagogue in his city that left 11 people dead and six others wounded, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto balked at President Trump’s statement that the massacre could have been prevented if the house of worship had employed an armed guard.

Authorities identified the victims during a Sunday press conference. The victims' ages range from 54 to 97. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the charges “could lead to the death penalty.” Bowers was taken into custody after being wounded in a shootout with police at the scene of the "horrific" mass shooting, according to law enforcement officials. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday afternoon. The attack is the worst on worshiping Jewish people in American history, according to a Cincinnati professor and director of the American Jewish Archives. Bowers allegedly burst into the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh and screamed anti-Semitic epithets as he opened fire on the congregants, law enforcement officials said. Bowers shot and killed the 11 victims before being confronted by police. The call of a shooting at the synagogue came in at around 9:54 a.m. ET, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said at a Saturday news conference. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting occurred at the synagogue during a baby-naming ceremony. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. As Bowers attempted to exit the synagogue, a gunfight erupted and two officers were injured, Pittsburgh bureau FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Jones said. In a later exchange of gunfire, two SWAT team members were injured. Bowers was taken into custody and is in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said.

Bowers was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns and used all four in the attack. The Associated Press reported Sunday that Bowers owned the weapons legally and had a license to carry them. Posts believed to be from Bowers’ social media accounts show pictures of several Glock pistols in their cases and derogatory remarks about refugees, Jewish people and President Donald Trump. Among his recent posts, one read, "Daily Reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person." Another said, "welp, it's 8 bells and time to raid the kike group." Bowers told an officer while he was being treated for his injuries “that he wanted all Jews to die and also that they (Jews) were committing genocide to his people,” a federal affidavit said.

The other two injured officers were expected to stay in the hospital, and one of them, a 40-year-old man, remained in critical condition. Two other people in the synagogue were wounded by Bowers. A 61-year-old woman was listed in stable condition, and a 70-year-old man was in critical condition, according to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

All of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries... We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called Saturday the "darkest day in Pittsburgh's history.” Asked at a news conference whether it's time to discuss the notion of removing guns from American society, Peduto said the efforts should focus on eliminating irrational behavior. "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder,” Peduto said.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-of-life-synagogue-shooter-pittsburgh_us_5bd475ffe4b055bc948c6ef2---split---Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges on Saturday evening against the man suspected of fatally shooting at least 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, allegedly opened fire Saturday morning at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters late Saturday afternoon that no children died in the shooting. Six people were reportedly injured, four of them police officers. A news conference to discuss the charges is scheduled for Sunday morning, The Associated Press reported.﻿ Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said he believed the suspect was wielding an “assault rifle” and also had at least three handguns with him. “This is the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” he said. Hissrich made similar comments at an earlier press conference that day. “It’s a very horrific crime scene,” Hissrich said at an earlier press conference. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve seen some plane crashes. It’s very bad.” Law enforcement responded to reports of an active shooter at the synagogue, which was crowded for Saturday services in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, shortly before 10 a.m. Police sources told KDKA that a gunman walked into the synagogue and yelled, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice plans to charge the suspect with hate crimes, along with other criminal charges. Congregation member Zachary Weiss, 26, told HuffPost that his father, Stephen Weiss, had been filling in on Saturday for a sick rabbi. “Anytime a congregant passes away you lose a friend,” said Weiss, noting that his father was unharmed. “The city is coming together and right now that is all we can do.” Multiple victims were being treated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, spokeswoman Amy Charley said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. “At this time, UPMC Presbyterian is treating four patients from the Tree of Life synagogue shooting,” she said. “Three victims are in surgery and one other is stable, awaiting surgery. Another patient at UPMC Presbyterian was treated and released. UPMC Mercy is treating a patient who is currently in surgery.” Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh told WHNT that he estimated between 60 and 100 people were inside the building when the shooting occurred. The synagogue had a Torah study and Shabbat services scheduled for Saturday, and a bris ― a Jewish ceremony in which an infant boy is circumcised ― was reportedly also taking place. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way,” Wolf said. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” The Tree of Life Congregation, founded more than 150 years ago, merged with Or L’Simcha in 2010 to form Tree of Life Or L’Simcha, according to its website. The synagogue describes itself as a Conservative Jewish congregation ― “Conservative” referring to a denomination of Judaism unrelated to political leanings. The site states that the synagogue is “true to traditional teachings while being “progressive and relevant to the way we live today.” Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun, who was not in the building at the time, told ABC News that the Squirrel Hill neighborhood hosts a number of other synagogues, along with Jewish gift shops and bookstores and kosher bakeries. “Absolutely no crime, it’s an amazing neighborhood, it’s hard to believe it’s a city neighborhood,” he said.

Both New York City and Los Angeles confirmed that they were increasing security measures as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. The New York Police Department told HuffPost it would be “deploying heavy weapons teams” at “houses of worship” across the city as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted that the LAPD would also be stepping up security. HuffPost reporter Saba Hamedy contributed to this report. This story has been updated.

Wax was killed when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Courtesy of Barry Werber via AP) PITTSBURGH – They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. A day after the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead, officials released the names of the victims. The oldest of them was 97. The youngest was 54. They included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. Said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation: "The loss is incalculable." CECIL AND DAVID ROSENTHAL: 'SWEET, GENTLE, CARING MEN' Cecil and David Rosenthal went through life together with help from a disability-services organization. And an important part of the brothers' lives was the Tree of Life synagogue, where they never missed a Saturday's services, people who knew them say. "If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be," Chris Schopf, a vice president of the organization ACHIEVA, said in a statement. Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday's deadly shooting. They lived semi-independently, and Cecil was a person who was up for all sorts of activities: a concert, lunch at Eat 'n Park — a regional restaurant chain known for its smiley-face cookies — even a trip to the Duquesne University dining hall, recalls David DeFelice, a Duquesne senior who was paired with him in a buddies program. "He was a very gregarious person — loved being social, loved people. ... You could put him any situation, and he'd make it work," chatting about the weather or asking students about their parents and talking about his own, says DeFelice. And when DeFelice recognized Hebrew letters on Cecil's calendar, the elder man was delighted to learn that his buddy was also Jewish and soon invited him to Tree of Life. DeFelice joined him on a couple of occasions and could see that Cecil cherished his faith and the sense of community he found at temple. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil, who according to his obituary was known as "the honorary mayor of Squirrel Hill," and David, who worked at Goodwill Industries. "They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated," he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with "such a gentle spirit." "Together, they looked out for each other," she said. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." The two left an impression on state Rep. David Frankel, who sometimes attends services at Tree of Life and whose chief of staff is the Rosenthals' sister. "They were very sweet, gentle, caring men," Frankel said. "... I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people." BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON: HELPING OTHERS AS A TEAM Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbor Jo Stepaniak says, and "they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness." "Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team," she said. The Simons were fixtures in in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She'd served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighborhood, with the couple's dog in years past. Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor — the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. And both Simons cared deeply about Tree of Life synagogue. "(They) were very devoted, an active, steady presence," said Berkun, the rabbi emeritus at the temple, where the couple was among those massacred Saturday. The Simons had married there in a candlelight ceremony nearly 62 years earlier, according to the Tribune-Review. Tragedy has struck their family before: One of the couple's sons died in a 2010 motorcycle accident in California. And now the Simons' death is reverberating through their family and community. "Bernice and Sylvan were very good, good-hearted, upstanding, honest, gracious, generous people. They were very dignified and compassionate," Stepaniak said, her voice breaking. "Best neighbors that you could ask for." MELVIN WAX: 'A SWEET, SWEET GUY' Melvin Wax was the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire during Sabbath services. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, says Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said "Mel," a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous. "He was such a kind, kind person," said Snider, chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee. "When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. "I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them," she said. Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," said Snider, a retired pharmacist. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person." Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday's services. "He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me," Snider said. "Just a sweet, sweet guy." JERRY RABINOWITZ: 'TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER' Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends with Rabinowitz for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. "He is one of the finest people I've ever met. We've been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that," Ciesielka said. "His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people." Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday's shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. "He was truly a trusted confidant and healer," he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. "Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best." Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its "kindest physicians." The hospital said in a statement that "the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss." "Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating," Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. JOYCE FIENBERG: 'MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING' Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 74, who was among the victims in Saturday's shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being," she said. The research center's current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor's degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and "a certain elegance and dignity" to the center, Perfetti said. "One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting," even if they were brief, he said. ""I was always impressed with her." Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: 'PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL' Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area's Hadassah chapter. "Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him," said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein, 71, was president of the Men's Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up "the religious heart" of the congregation, Cohen, the congregation co-president, said. Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, "he was somebody that everybody liked," Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER'S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. "I feel a part of me died in that building," Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday's shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that her regularly saw her at services. "Rose was really a fixture of the congregation," Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret "Peg" Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who several have noted often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, "led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. "He died doing what he liked to do most," said Don Salvin, Gottfried's brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: 'NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD' A neighbor in Pittburgh's Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as "a really nice guy." Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. "I'm scared for my kids' future," Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. "How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?" Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she's lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a "wonderful" father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner "talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,' Prizner told the Tribune-Review. ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh.

(Oct. 28) AP People gather under the US and the Israeli flags projected on the walls of Jerusalem old city on October 28, 2018, organised by Jerusalem municipality to show solidarity with the Pittsburgh Jewish community following the shooting attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo: MENAHEM KAHANA, AFP/Getty Images)  The horrific killing of 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue has taken a festering problem out of the shadows and put it in the spotlight: anti-Semitism is on the rise in America. Bomb threats, menacing messages on social media and assaults on Jewish Americans have become increasingly common in recent years, according to researchers and federal data. Even before the attack – believed to be the deadliest in U.S. history targeting American Jews – violence and harassment of Jewish people and institutions was rising sharply, coinciding with a moment when American politics has become sharply divided. There were at least 1,986 such incidents motivated by anti-Jewish bias – including physical assaults, vandalism and attacks on Jewish institutions – in 2017, a 57 percent spike in incidents over the year before, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a group that tracks and fights anti-Semitism. The ADL also published a report this month that found an alarming increase in the amount of anti-Semitic content on social media in the lead-up to next month’s midterm elections.  “Prior to the election of President Donald Trump, anti-Semitic harassment and attacks were rare and unexpected, even for Jewish Americans who were prominently situated in the public eye,” authors Samuel Woolley and Katie Joseff wrote. “Following his election, anti-Semitism has become normalized and harassment is a daily occurrence. The harassment, deeply rooted in age-old conspiracies such as the New World Order, which alleges that an evil cabal of Jewish people have taken autocratic control of the globe, and Holocaust imagery – faces placed inside Nazi concentration camp ovens or stretched on lampshades – shows no signs of abating.” Authorities on Saturday charged Robert Bowers, 46, with murder, hate crime and firearms offenses for the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue. Before surrendering to police, the suspect ranted that Jews were “committing genocide to my people” and “I just want to kill Jews,” according to a criminal complaint. The suspect also appeared to have posted virulently anti-Semitic messages on a social media platform popular with far-right extremists, including an angry diatribe apparently written shortly before the attack. More: A 97-year-old, an elderly wife and husband: These are the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre More: Hundreds gather at candle-light vigil for synagogue shooting victims More: Suspect charged with 29 counts in 'horrific' synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh Vice President Mike Pence told NBC News that "we need to be very careful" before connecting political debate and "the kind of violent behavior we witnessed in Pittsburgh," the "threats of violence against prominent Americans that we witnessed in the pipe bombs" mailed to prominent Trump critics last week, or other recent mass shootings. A 97-year-old, an elderly wife and husband: The 11 Pittsburgh victims Woolley and Joseff’s analysis of 7.5 million postings on Twitter between Aug. 31 to Sept. 17 found a significant share of anti-Semitic messaging on the social media site they reviewed leading up to the midterms – as many as 30 percent –appeared to come from automated accounts, or bots. The ADL researchers, as well as Jonathan Albright, director of the digital forensics initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, also have found that George Soros, the billionaire Hungarian-American and liberal philanthropist, has increasingly become the target of some of the worst anti-Semitic vitriol on social media platforms. Soros, who is Jewish and a backer of Democratic Party candidates, is frequently framed by right-wingers as being responsible for unfounded conspiracies. Trump has accused Soros of paying demonstrators who protested in Washington against the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Soros was one of a dozen high-profile Trump critics targeted last week in a series of attempted bombings authorities said was carried out by a Florida man who was arrested Friday. Alexander Soros, the son of George Soros, wrote in a New York Times op-ed last week that his father had long been targeted by anti-Semitic attacks from white supremacists. “But with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, things got worse,” wrote the younger Soros, who also noted that Trump’s final TV ad of the 2016 campaign disparagingly featured his father as well as prominent Jews Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and Lloyd Blankfein, chairman of Goldman Sachs. “A genie was let out of the bottle, which may take generations to put back in, and it wasn’t confined to the United States." After Saturday’s mass shooting, Trump condemned the attack as an "anti-Semitic act" and “pure evil.” "There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice," Trump said. Still, some lawmakers questioned whether Trump’s rhetoric was stoking the vitriol. "This president's modus operandi Is to divide us,” Rep. Adam Schiff told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “It's not enough that a day on a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us into conflict with one another.” Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, defended the president and noted that the suspected gunman had criticized Trump as a “globalist.” "Now President Trump and his rhetoric is very direct, but I don't see how you connect President Trump to a person who's deranged going into a synagogue,” Lankford said on CBS' Face the Nation. “He's been very clear about anti-Semitism, as well as all of us have been. That is a sick, vile thing." Federal data show that 54.4 percent of hate crimes committed in the U.S. in 2016, the last year for which FBI data are available, was motivated by the perpetrators with anti-Jewish bias.  In August 2017, dozens of white supremacists took part in a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where marchers shouted the Nazi-era salutation "Sieg Heil" and chanted “Jews will not replace us.” An Ohio man was charged with hate crimes after driving his vehicle into a group of counterprotesters at the Charlottesville rally, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Last year, Evansville, Indiana’s Temple Adath B'Nai officials reported that someone had fired a bullet through a window of their house of worship. No one was hurt in the incident, which came a day after legislation died in the Indiana Legislature that would have allowed judges to imposes stiffer sentences for crimes motivated by race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Separately, dozens of tombstones were overturned in Jewish cemeteries in Missouri and Pennsylvania last year. In Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the center of Jewish life in the Rust Belt city, the community was cognizant that anti-Jewish fervor was something that needed to be taken seriously. The Jewish Community Center and a nearby school recently had active-shooter drills, said Rabbi Amy Bardack, who was attending services at nearby Beth Shalom synagogue when she heard about the shooting. Anti-Semitic acts had taken place in community before, but not anything that caused physical harm to people, she added. "October 27th will forever be a line in the sand of before and after," Bardack said. The suspected Pittsburgh gunman had a long and troubling online history and at one point turned to biblical passages to try to buttress his anti-Semitic beliefs. On his web page, Bowers featured a paraphrase of a verse from the Bible as “jews are the children of satan. (john 8:44) --- the lord jesus Christ is come in the flesh.” While this portion of the Book of John has been used over the centuries as an excuse for attacking Jews, that is a flawed reading of it, said Sandra Schneiders, an emeritus professor of the New Testament at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, Calif. Jesus is not talking about all people who are Jewish, Schneiders said. “He is speaking to a particular group of Jews in Jerusalem. He’s clearly arguing with the authorities,” Schneiders, author of “Written that You Might Believe: Encountering Jesus in the Fourth Gospel.” “He says that they say they are the descendants of Abraham, but they are trying to kill him, so they are showing their true parentage which is determined by what you do.” And that true parentage is Satan, Schneiders said. “This man who shot all of these people, someone needs to say to him: ‘You claim to be a follower of Jesus, but this is not what Jesus said. You’re revealing your true parentage by your actions.” Contributing: William Cummings

---split---6.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-synagogue-reax-20181027-story.html---split---After word spread about the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, Rabbi Sarah Bassin of Beverly Hills quickly changed her planned sermon. Eleven people were killed and six injured in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the hub of the Jewish community, police said. Four police officers were among the wounded. The suspected gunman was arrested at the scene and identified as Robert Bowers, 46, authorities said. He has a history of making anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant social media posts. Bassin found a July blog post written by Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers about gun violence, titled “We deserve better.” In the post, Myers lamented that tragic events lead to thoughts and prayers by elected officials but little else before the nation’s collective conscience moves on. “Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the mid-term elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume,” he said. Bassin read the post to her congregation at Temple Emanuel. “It’s an innate cycle of these mass shootings — they are devastating and soul killing each time, and then they fade from memory,” she said after Saturday’s service. “I can’t imagine that he thought it would actually come to his community.” Temple Emanuel senior Rabbi Jonathan Aaron sent an email to congregants saying that Beverly Hills police had increased patrols in the neighborhood, just as Los Angeles police and sheriff’s departments also stepped up patrols around places of worship throughout the region. “Our synagogue is being watched closely, and we have taken measures to bolster our security,” he said. “We are on high alert in the synagogue and are prepared to protect ourselves from anyone that would do us harm.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted a similar message of caution, saying he had reached out to Jewish community leaders. “We mourn with #TreeOfLife community today,” he said. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors are investigating the killings as a hate crime and could seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter. The gunman, who was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, yelled, “All Jews must die!” as he walked into the synagogue, police told local television reporters. The shooting, which began shortly before 10 a.m. Eastern time, was likely “the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,” according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century. Amanda Susskind, Los Angeles regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said anti-Semitic incidents were up by 57% nationwide in 2016-17. Susskind recalled the 1999 shooting at a Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills by a self-professed white supremacist. Armed with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and wounded five people — including three children ages 5 and 6 — before he left the center and killed a mail carrier in Chatsworth. Furrow is serving a life sentence. Fortunately, Susskind said, there have been no similar incidences in the Los Angeles area since. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, President Trump suggested that if the Pittsburgh synagogue had armed security, “maybe it could have been a very much different situation." Susskind said security can be helpful but isn’t the only way to protect places of worship from harm. "Frankly, if someone is coming in with guns blazing, it’s hard to say whether that would make a difference,” she said. “Synagogues struggle with balancing wanting to be open to the community and protecting congregants. It's a tough, conflicting thing.” In Pico-Robertson, one of L.A.’s prominent Jewish communities, Stefani Sherwin, 69, said she was devastated to learn about the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, especially after the spate of suspicious, potentially explosive devices sent in recent days to prominent critics or political rivals of Trump. The targets included former President Obama and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “At some point I believe we get desensitized to it,” Sherwin said. “I don’t cry about it anymore — it’s almost expected.” Even so, Sherwin, who grew up in Pico-Robertson and now lives in the Pacific Palisades, said she feels scared about the increase in xenophobia that she’s noticed since Trump took office. “I don’t think I look Jewish, so maybe that serves me,” she said. “But I think the Jewish community is always looking over their shoulders.” Bassin, of Temple Emanuel, said she hopes to see an increased focus within the Jewish community on gun reform that can outlast the news cycle. “We all know that thoughts and prayers alone are insufficient,” she said. The Interfaith Solidarity Network, a group of L.A.-area interfaith leaders, issued a statement Saturday calling on faith leaders across the country to step up efforts of unity and tolerance. “The ISN condemns the shooting as a xenophobic act of violence stemming from ongoing national divisive rhetoric and policies, and stands in solidarity with the victims of this heinous and racist act,” the organization said. The ISN plans to hold an Interfaith Solidarity March on Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. The milelong walk will begin at Temple Aliyah, 6025 Valley Circle Blvd., in Woodland Hills.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/shooting-victim-melvin-wax-remembered-sweet-sweet-guy-151522734.html---split---PITTSBURGH (AP) — They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. A day after the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead, officials released the names of the victims. The oldest of them was 97. The youngest was 54. They included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. Said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation: "The loss is incalculable." CECIL AND DAVID ROSENTHAL: 'SWEET, GENTLE, CARING MEN' Cecil and David Rosenthal went through life together with help from a disability-services organization. And an important part of the brothers' lives was the Tree of Life synagogue, where they never missed a Saturday's services, people who knew them say. "If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be," Chris Schopf, a vice president of the organization ACHIEVA, said in a statement. Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday's deadly shooting. They lived semi-independently, and Cecil was a person who was up for all sorts of activities: a concert, lunch at Eat 'n Park — a regional restaurant chain known for its smiley-face cookies — even a trip to the Duquesne University dining hall, recalls David DeFelice, a Duquesne senior who was paired with him in a buddies program. "He was a very gregarious person — loved being social, loved people. ... You could put him any situation, and he'd make it work," chatting about the weather or asking students about their parents and talking about his own, says DeFelice. And when DeFelice recognized Hebrew letters on Cecil's calendar, the elder man was delighted to learn that his buddy was also Jewish and soon invited him to Tree of Life. DeFelice joined him on a couple of occasions and could see that Cecil cherished his faith and the sense of community he found at temple. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil and David. "They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated," he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with "such a gentle spirit." "Together, they looked out for each other," she said. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." The two left an impression on state Rep. David Frankel, who sometimes attends services at Tree of Life and whose chief of staff is the Rosenthals' sister. "They were very sweet, gentle, caring men," Frankel said. "... I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people." MELVIN WAX: 'A SWEET, SWEET GUY' Melvin Wax was the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire during Sabbath services. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, says Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said "Mel," a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous. "He was such a kind, kind person," said Snider, chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee. "When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. "I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them," she said. Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," said Snider, a retired pharmacist. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person." Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday's services. "He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me," Snider said. "Just a sweet, sweet guy." JERRY RABINOWITZ: 'TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER' Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends with Rabinowitz for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. "He is one of the finest people I've ever met. We've been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that," Ciesielka said. "His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people." Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday's shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. "He was truly a trusted confidant and healer," he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. "Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best." Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its "kindest physicians." The hospital said in a statement that "the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss." "Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating," Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. JOYCE FIENBERG: 'MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING' Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 74, who was among the victims in Saturday's shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being," she said. The research center's current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor's degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and "a certain elegance and dignity" to the center, Perfetti said. "One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting," even if they were brief, he said. ""I was always impressed with her." Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: 'PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL' Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area's Hadassah chapter. "Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him," said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein, 71, was president of the Men's Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up "the religious heart" of the congregation, Cohen, the congregation co-president, said. Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, "he was somebody that everybody liked," Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER'S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. "I feel a part of me died in that building," Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday's shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that her regularly saw her at services. "Rose was really a fixture of the congregation," Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret "Peg" Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who several have noted often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, "led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. "He died doing what he liked to do most," said Don Salvin, Gottfried's brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: 'NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD' A neighbor in Pittburgh's Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as "a really nice guy." Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. "I'm scared for my kids' future," Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. "How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?" Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she's lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a "wonderful" father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner "talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,' Prizner told the Tribune-Review. ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh.

Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday’s deadly shooting.

Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil, who according to his obituary was known as “the honorary mayor of Squirrel Hill,” and David, who worked at Goodwill Industries. “They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated,” he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with “such a gentle spirit.” “Together, they looked out for each other,” she said. “Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around.” The two left an impression on state Rep.

I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people.” BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON: HELPING OTHERS AS A TEAM Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbor Jo Stepaniak says, and “they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness.” “Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team,” she said. The Simons were fixtures in in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She’d served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighborhood, with the couple’s dog in years past. Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor — the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. And both Simons cared deeply about Tree of Life synagogue. ″(They) were very devoted, an active, steady presence,” said Berkun, the rabbi emeritus at the temple, where the couple was among those massacred Saturday. The Simons had married there in a candlelight ceremony nearly 62 years earlier, according to the Tribune-Review. Tragedy has struck their family before: One of the couple’s sons died in a 2010 motorcycle accident in California. And now the Simons’ death is reverberating through their family and community. “Bernice and Sylvan were very good, good-hearted, upstanding, honest, gracious, generous people. They were very dignified and compassionate,” Stepaniak said, her voice breaking. “Best neighbors that you could ask for.” MELVIN WAX: ‘A SWEET, SWEET GUY’ Melvin Wax was the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire during Sabbath services. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, says Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said “Mel,” a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous. “He was such a kind, kind person,” said Snider, chairman of the congregation’s cemetery committee. “When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them. “He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won’t say all the time. But most of the time.” New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. “I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them,” she said. Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. “He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services,” said Snider, a retired pharmacist. “If somebody didn’t come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person.” Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday’s services. “He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me,” Snider said. “Just a sweet, sweet guy.” JERRY RABINOWITZ: ‘TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER’ Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends with Rabinowitz for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. “He is one of the finest people I’ve ever met. We’ve been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that,” Ciesielka said. “His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people.” Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday’s shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. “He was truly a trusted confidant and healer,” he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. “Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best.” Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its “kindest physicians.” The hospital said in a statement that “the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss.” “Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating,” Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. JOYCE FIENBERG: ‘MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING’ Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 74, who was among the victims in Saturday’s shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg’s research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. “Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being,” she said. The research center’s current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor’s degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and “a certain elegance and dignity” to the center, Perfetti said. “One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting,” even if they were brief, he said. ”“I was always impressed with her.” Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: ‘PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL’ Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area’s Hadassah chapter. “Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him,” said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. “Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel.” Stein, 71, was president of the Men’s Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up “the religious heart” of the congregation, Cohen, the congregation co-president, said. Stein’s nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle “was always willing to help anybody.” With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, “he was somebody that everybody liked,” Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER’S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. “I feel a part of me died in that building,” Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday’s shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that her regularly saw her at services. “Rose was really a fixture of the congregation,” Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret “Peg” Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who several have noted often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, “led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen,” Cohen said. “He died doing what he liked to do most,” said Don Salvin, Gottfried’s brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: ‘NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD’ A neighbor in Pittburgh’s Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as “a really nice guy.” Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. “I’m scared for my kids’ future,” Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. “How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?” Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she’s lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a “wonderful” father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner “talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,′ Prizner told the Tribune-Review. ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17805842/jacksonville-madden-shooting-survivor-lawsuit-ea-restaurant---split---A victim of the Jacksonville shooting last week that left three dead and 11 wounded has filed a negligent-security lawsuit that targets both EA, the makers of Madden, the game featured in the video game tournament where the shooting took place, and the locale that hosted the qualifier. According to Kotaku, Jacob Mitich was shot twice during the event, and now he’s seeking damages on the basis that EA and the venue “failed to provide a safe and secure environment.” After the shooting, Jacksonville fire marshals shut down the game bar and the pizzeria where it is located, citing a failure to submit building plans that included the game bar as well as three fire code violations. These include blocked exits, using strip plugs as permanent wiring, and using extension cords as a substitute for permanent wiring. Fire Marshal Kevin Jones’ code violation report says that the tragedy “would not have occurred” if the pizzeria had followed the rules because the game room area would not exist. Mitich is not the only one planning a lawsuit: as USA Today reports, personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan has multiple clients who say they’ve suffered physical or emotional trauma and are preparing to file lawsuits in retaliation. “[Mitich] trusted the event host and organizers, and believed that he was walking into a safe space,” Morgan attorney James Young told Kotaku. “That trust was shattered when shots rang out in an over-crowded, since-shut-down, non-permitted space. Combined with an alleged abject failure to provide adequate security, the result was tragic. We are bringing this lawsuit to hold those responsible accountable, and to ensure that gamers like Jake are able to get together to pursue their passion without having to fear for their lives.” Previously, victims of a mass shooting have tried to sue the venue where the tragedy occurred, but in the case of the 2012 Aurora movie theater massacre, the plaintiffs ended up owing the defendants $700,000 instead. The Jacksonville shooting victims may have a better chance, however, given the fire marshal-cited safety violations. EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but earlier this week, the company pledged to donate a million dollars to the victims of the shooting. EA also canceled the rest of the Madden tournaments that were scheduled for 2018, noting that it was going to spend some time establishing better security protocols with its tournament partners.

Speaking at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before departing for an Indianapolis speech, he decried the “hate in our country” and insisted that steps be taken. “They had a maniac walk in and they didn’t have any protection and that is so sad to see,” Trump said in Maryland. “If you take a look at it, if they had protection inside, the results would have been far better.” Trump made similar suggestion after February’s Parkland, Florida school shootings, say... Producer and filmmaker Adi Shankar has said in an interview that Apu, the long-running convenience store owner from The Simpsons, may be out of the series.

President Donald Trump has been on the road a lot lately, doing three Make America Great Again rallies just in the last week. But the President isn’t totally relying on live events as he tries to push for fellow Republicans in the midterms. He’s also using Twitter shout-outs. Today’s early tweetstorm mainly focused on stumping for various Republican candidates around the country, as the Commander-in-Tweet used his considerable number of followers (reduced in the last week, much to his chagrin, but a Twitter cleanup operation) to spread the word on the coming elections. The tweetstorm so far... Clocking in at a stunning seven hours and 20 minutes with 18 innings, Game 3 of the 2018 World Series made history last night as the longest fall classic ever.

Baseball fans on Twitter were livid on Friday night, as DirecTV experienced technical difficulties that took the service offline in the 10th inning of the World Series.

The teams remained tied into the 11th inning. Boston leads the Series two games to none. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to take the World Series, making this practically a make or break g... UPDATE, with New Rules Halloween video The hashtag “#MAGAbomber” came for Cesar Sayoc Jr. nearly as quickly as his arrest today, but Bill Maher reached back a couple years for something a tad more classic. “Is it okay to call this one deplorable?,” Maher asked during his opening monologue on tonight’s Real Time With Bill Maher. “Or would that hurt Republicans’ feelings?” Maher would eventually get to his annual gripe about politically correct (or not) Halloween costumes (watch that video bit above, and read about it below), but first he had some laughs to squeeze from that mail bomber – and... President Donald Trump lashed out at the media tonight at a Make America Great Again rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, claiming it was trying to blame him for the recent bomb package scares.

Robert Durst, who famously may have confessed to a murder on an HBO documentary, will have to stand trial for the 2000 slaying of his best friend, writer Susan Berman. A judge ruled Thursday there is enough evidence for Durst to stand trial. Durst is charged with shooting Berman in the back of the head at her Benedict Canyon home. Durst, age 75 ,was the subject of HBO’s The Jinx, a miniseries examining his wife’s disappearance, Berman’s death, and the killing of Durst neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Durst was eventually arrested in New Orleans in connection with Berman’s slaying on March 14,... SPOILER ALERT: This article includes details about tonight’s premiere episode of Legacies.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-of-life-synagogue-shooter-pittsburgh_us_5bd475ffe4b055bc948c6ef2---split---Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges on Saturday evening against the man suspected of fatally shooting at least 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, allegedly opened fire Saturday morning at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters late Saturday afternoon that no children died in the shooting. Six people were reportedly injured, four of them police officers. A news conference to discuss the charges is scheduled for Sunday morning, The Associated Press reported.﻿ Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said he believed the suspect was wielding an “assault rifle” and also had at least three handguns with him. “This is the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” he said. Hissrich made similar comments at an earlier press conference that day. “It’s a very horrific crime scene,” Hissrich said at an earlier press conference. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve seen some plane crashes. It’s very bad.” Law enforcement responded to reports of an active shooter at the synagogue, which was crowded for Saturday services in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, shortly before 10 a.m. Police sources told KDKA that a gunman walked into the synagogue and yelled, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice plans to charge the suspect with hate crimes, along with other criminal charges. Congregation member Zachary Weiss, 26, told HuffPost that his father, Stephen Weiss, had been filling in on Saturday for a sick rabbi. “Anytime a congregant passes away you lose a friend,” said Weiss, noting that his father was unharmed. “The city is coming together and right now that is all we can do.” Multiple victims were being treated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, spokeswoman Amy Charley said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. “At this time, UPMC Presbyterian is treating four patients from the Tree of Life synagogue shooting,” she said. “Three victims are in surgery and one other is stable, awaiting surgery. Another patient at UPMC Presbyterian was treated and released. UPMC Mercy is treating a patient who is currently in surgery.” Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh told WHNT that he estimated between 60 and 100 people were inside the building when the shooting occurred. The synagogue had a Torah study and Shabbat services scheduled for Saturday, and a bris ― a Jewish ceremony in which an infant boy is circumcised ― was reportedly also taking place. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way,” Wolf said. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” The Tree of Life Congregation, founded more than 150 years ago, merged with Or L’Simcha in 2010 to form Tree of Life Or L’Simcha, according to its website. The synagogue describes itself as a Conservative Jewish congregation ― “Conservative” referring to a denomination of Judaism unrelated to political leanings. The site states that the synagogue is “true to traditional teachings while being “progressive and relevant to the way we live today.” Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun, who was not in the building at the time, told ABC News that the Squirrel Hill neighborhood hosts a number of other synagogues, along with Jewish gift shops and bookstores and kosher bakeries. “Absolutely no crime, it’s an amazing neighborhood, it’s hard to believe it’s a city neighborhood,” he said.

Both New York City and Los Angeles confirmed that they were increasing security measures as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. The New York Police Department told HuffPost it would be “deploying heavy weapons teams” at “houses of worship” across the city as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted that the LAPD would also be stepping up security. HuffPost reporter Saba Hamedy contributed to this report. This story has been updated.
---split---6.0---split---https://www.apnews.com/68ace87d05b94a328109937c1885937e---split---This undated photo provided by Barry Werber shows Melvin Wax. Wax was killed when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Courtesy of Barry Werber via AP) PITTSBURGH (AP) — They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. A day after the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead, officials released the names of the victims. The oldest of them was 97. The youngest was 54. They included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. Said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation: “The loss is incalculable.” CECIL AND DAVID ROSENTHAL: ‘SWEET, GENTLE, CARING MEN’ Cecil and David Rosenthal went through life together with help from a disability-services organization. And an important part of the brothers’ lives was the Tree of Life synagogue, where they never missed a Saturday’s services, people who knew them say. “If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be,” Chris Schopf, a vice president of the organization ACHIEVA, said in a statement. Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday’s deadly shooting. They lived semi-independently, and Cecil was a person who was up for all sorts of activities: a concert, lunch at Eat ’n Park — a regional restaurant chain known for its smiley-face cookies — even a trip to the Duquesne University dining hall, recalls David DeFelice, a Duquesne senior who was paired with him in a buddies program. “He was a very gregarious person — loved being social, loved people. ... You could put him any situation, and he’d make it work,” chatting about the weather or asking students about their parents and talking about his own, says DeFelice. And when DeFelice recognized Hebrew letters on Cecil’s calendar, the elder man was delighted to learn that his buddy was also Jewish and soon invited him to Tree of Life. DeFelice joined him on a couple of occasions and could see that Cecil cherished his faith and the sense of community he found at temple. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil, who according to his obituary was known as “the honorary mayor of Squirrel Hill,” and David, who worked at Goodwill Industries. “They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated,” he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with “such a gentle spirit.” “Together, they looked out for each other,” she said. “Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around.” The two left an impression on state Rep. David Frankel, who sometimes attends services at Tree of Life and whose chief of staff is the Rosenthals’ sister. “They were very sweet, gentle, caring men,” Frankel said. ”... I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people.” BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON: HELPING OTHERS AS A TEAM Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbor Jo Stepaniak says, and “they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness.” “Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team,” she said. The Simons were fixtures in in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She’d served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighborhood, with the couple’s dog in years past. Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor — the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. And both Simons cared deeply about Tree of Life synagogue. ″(They) were very devoted, an active, steady presence,” said Berkun, the rabbi emeritus at the temple, where the couple was among those massacred Saturday. The Simons had married there in a candlelight ceremony nearly 62 years earlier, according to the Tribune-Review. Tragedy has struck their family before: One of the couple’s sons died in a 2010 motorcycle accident in California. And now the Simons’ death is reverberating through their family and community. “Bernice and Sylvan were very good, good-hearted, upstanding, honest, gracious, generous people. They were very dignified and compassionate,” Stepaniak said, her voice breaking. “Best neighbors that you could ask for.” MELVIN WAX: ‘A SWEET, SWEET GUY’ Melvin Wax was the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire during Sabbath services. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, says Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said “Mel,” a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous. “He was such a kind, kind person,” said Snider, chairman of the congregation’s cemetery committee. “When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them. “He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won’t say all the time. But most of the time.” New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. “I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them,” she said. Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. “He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services,” said Snider, a retired pharmacist. “If somebody didn’t come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person.” Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday’s services. “He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me,” Snider said. “Just a sweet, sweet guy.” JERRY RABINOWITZ: ‘TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER’ Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends with Rabinowitz for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. “He is one of the finest people I’ve ever met. We’ve been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that,” Ciesielka said. “His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people.” Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday’s shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. “He was truly a trusted confidant and healer,” he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. “Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best.” Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its “kindest physicians.” The hospital said in a statement that “the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss.” “Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating,” Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. JOYCE FIENBERG: ‘MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING’ Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 74, who was among the victims in Saturday’s shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg’s research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. “Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being,” she said. The research center’s current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor’s degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and “a certain elegance and dignity” to the center, Perfetti said. “One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting,” even if they were brief, he said. ”“I was always impressed with her.” Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: ‘PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL’ Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area’s Hadassah chapter. “Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him,” said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. “Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel.” Stein, 71, was president of the Men’s Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up “the religious heart” of the congregation, Cohen, the congregation co-president, said. Stein’s nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle “was always willing to help anybody.” With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, “he was somebody that everybody liked,” Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER’S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. “I feel a part of me died in that building,” Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday’s shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that her regularly saw her at services. “Rose was really a fixture of the congregation,” Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret “Peg” Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who several have noted often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, “led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen,” Cohen said. “He died doing what he liked to do most,” said Don Salvin, Gottfried’s brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: ‘NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD’ A neighbor in Pittburgh’s Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as “a really nice guy.” Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. “I’m scared for my kids’ future,” Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. “How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?” Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she’s lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a “wonderful” father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner “talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,′ Prizner told the Tribune-Review. ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh. Associated Press reporters Allen G. Breed in Raleigh, North Carolina and Robert Bumsted in Pittsburgh and researcher Monika Mather in Washington contributed to this story.

Another six people were injured, two of them critically – including four police officers having exchanged fire with the shooter. Among the injured were a 61-year-old woman, a 70-year-old man and a 55-year old police officer. A suspect – later named as Robert Bowers, who is in his 40s – was arrested at the scene and also taken to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions later announced the Justice Department will file hate crimes charges against Mr Bowers, “including charges that could lead to the death penalty". There were a number of services underway at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, including a baby-naming ceremony or bris, when the active shooter call was placed to police just before 10am. “It’s a very horrific crime scene,“ Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh public safety director, said at the scene. “One of the worst that I’ve seen.” Law enforcement officials said that the shooter was armed with an assault weapon, and three handguns – although it was not clear all were used. Dispatchers on police radio claimed that the shooter made a number of comments during a stand-off with police about wanting to kill Jews. Federal officials said the shooter went into the synagogue and shot the congregation before being engaged by officers on his way out. Two were shot before the gunman returned into the building to hide from approaching Swat teams. Two Swat officers were injured in a later exchange of gunfire. The FBI are now leading the federal hate crime investigation. Mr Bowers is said to have been acting alone, with the lead FBI investigator, Bob Jones, saying that officials believed he was unknown to law enforcement before the shooting. Speaking at a Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis, Mr Trump called the shooting a “wicked act of mass murder” that is antisemitic and “pure evil, hard to believe.The president added that antisemitism ”must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears". The FBI say they will now be looking into every facet of the suspect’s life as they seek to pin down a motive. From his home, to his vehicle, to his movements in recent days. However a focus will be his social media output, with accounts under the suspect's name appearing to show a number of antisemitic rants. A social media post just before the time of the shooting under a profile with the name Robert Bowers said a Jewish refugee organisation, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in". Saturday’s mass shooting comes just 10 days before a bitterly fought national midterm election that has divided the country and set Americans on edge, and in a week in which more than a dozen pipe bombs were mailed to critics of Mr Trump. Mr Trump said on his way to Indianapolis, before a later rally in Illinois: “It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done.” If you want to see how the day unfolded read our live coverage below. Rabbi Chuck Diamond, a former spiritual leader of Tree of Life, told reporters that he never spoke to his congregation about what to do during a shooting, but it's something he thought about. "There's a lot of anti-Semitism out there and a lot of hate out there," Mr Diamond said. "Sobering that it's touched our community." Please allow a moment for the live blog to load

A federal trial in Colorado could have far-reaching effects on the United States’ budding marijuana industry if a jury sides with a couple who say having a cannabis business as a neighbor hurts their property’s value. The trial set to begin Monday in Denver is the first time a jury will consider a lawsuit using federal anti-racketeering law to target cannabis companies. But the marijuana industry has closely watched the case since 2015, when attorneys with a Washington, D.C.-based firm first filed their sweeping complaint on behalf of Hope and Michael Reilly.

Sphen and Magic — or Sphengic, as they are collectively known — proved themselves natural parents when they incubated a dummy egg given to them by staff at Sydney’s Sea Life Aquarium, where they live. They were then entrusted with a real egg from another couple that laid two during this year’s breeding season. Because gentoo penguins usually have only enough resources to raise one egg successfully, the “backup” chick often dies. Sphen and Magic began developing a strong bond and became inseparable before bree... Before he was a politician, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom was a businessman, and over the years he became a millionaire through his holdings in wineries, bars, restaurants, hotels and liquor stores.

A former Catholic priest who was convicted of sexually abusing minors is the subject of a lawsuit filed by two brothers who say he molested them in the early 1990s while he ministered at a church in Riverside.

A teenager released from adult detention after mistakenly being determined to be an adult has been redetained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after turning 18. The teenager’s case highlighted the controversial use of dental forensics to determine age.

At that point, the Office of Refugee Resettlement removed him from a youth shelter and turned him over to ICE, which held him in Orange County jails with adult immigrant detainees for nearly a year.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-gather-vigil-pittsburgh-synagogue-023059353.html---split---Thousands of people gathered in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday night to mourn the 11 people killed and several others injured after a man opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue that morning. To pay tribute to the lives that were lost, the mourners crowded the streets in the neighborhood, holding candles, singing songs and pleading silently with signs to end the hate and violence. While the Squirrel Hill neighborhood has attracted a diverse range of residents in recent years, it remains a historic hub for Pittsburgh’s Jewish population. Drew Barkley, the executive director of the nearby synagogue Temple Sinai, told Time magazine on Saturday that the community is tight-knit. “The sad part is that people are waiting to find out who the dead are because it’s such a close-knit community there’s like one degree of separation and chances are everyone will know at least one person who died,” Barkley said. An unbelievable sea of people now at Murray and Forbes. Lighting candles and singing @WPXIpic.twitter.com/CuLt8cvsii Students from the nearby Taylor Allderdice High School organized the candlelight vigil, which began inside the Sixth Presbyterian Church before moving to the streets, in the hours after the shooting. More than 3,000 people attended the event to show their support, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “This was a very emotional, beautiful vigil, so proud of our community, our hearts are broken from this senseless, senseless hate crime against the Jewish community,” Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle (D), who was in attendance, said, according to CBS Pittsburgh. “To see these young students say what they had to say and to show that strength and the sense of community that exists here, that this is not something that we’re going to let break us, was really inspiring,” he continued. Allderdice High School is less than one and a half miles from where the massacre took place. Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in an apparently anti-Semitic attack, leaving nearly a dozen people dead and injuring six others. The synagogue was reportedly crowded at the time of the shooting, with at least three services and events scheduled for the day. Officials said Bowers, who reportedly had an “assault rifle” and at least three handguns, announced his presence to the congregation by shouting, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. He was later arrested after exchanging fire with police officers. The shooting is considered one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish people in recent U.S. history. President Donald Trump called the shooting “evil” and said anti-Semitism was poison to the country during a rally in Murphysboro, Illinois. “This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It’s an assault on humanity,” Trump said at a rally in Illinois. “It will require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-Semitism from our world.” Tonight Frances and I attended a vigil for the victims of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. Anti-Semitism has absolutely no place in our commonwealth. Together we pray for the victims, their families and friends, and this entire community. #StrongerThanHatepic.twitter.com/w5HiMGmdCh Speaking at the vigil, Sophia Levin, a sophomore at Allderdice High School whose mother and grandparents attended Tree of Life synagogue, said that the mass shooting has changed her. “Anti-Semitism was something that happened in history, that happened in other places,” she said, according to The New York Times. “I am a different Jew today than I was yesterday,” Levin also said, the Post-Gazette reported. “I hope that the Jew I am today will be stronger.” See photos of the vigil below. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the vigil was held outside the Tree of Life synagogue. It was actually held elsewhere in the neighborhood.

It seems unlikely that efforts to soften a possible dismissal after the Nov. 6 midterm election would find sympathy in the White House, where President Donald Trump's rage remains unabated over the attorney general's recusal from the Russia investigation. A hand-picked successor could theoretical...

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's campaign rallies continued. Attack ads stayed on the airwaves. Political combat largely carried on. Amid a wave of election-season violence that left many Americans on edge, the contentious midterm campaign has barreled forward with little pause.

But the divisiveness that has dominated the nation's politics kept creeping back. During a rally Saturday night, Trump asked a crowd of red-hatt...

USA TODAY Mourners place flowers outside the Tree of Life synagogue, Oct. 28, 2018, Pittsburgh. (Photo: Vincent Pugliese, EPA-EFE) The gunman who opened fire on a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday killing 11 people and wounding six others has been charged by federal law enforcement officials who say he targeted his victims because of their Jewish faith. Robert Bowers has been charged with 29 crimes: 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. (Bowers was also charged Saturday by Pittsburgh police with crimes including 11 counts of homicide.) More: Everything you need to know about hate crimes More: Pittsburgh synagogue rampage spotlights rising anti-Semitism in America “The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,” per the U.S. Attorney’s Office Western District of Pennsylvania. But what makes a crime a hate crime — and what does it take to prove one? A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism — with an added element of bias, according to the FBI. The bureau explains: “For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a ‘criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.’ Hate itself is not a crime, and the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.” More: A people raised in violence had found peace in Squirrel Hill before synagogue mass shooting More: Hate crimes are up in America's 10 largest cities. Here's why Pittsburgh Bureau FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Jones said Bowers “targeted [the victims] simply because of their faith.” Reports have linked Bowers to anti-semitic online postings and anti-semitic comments made immediately before and after the shooting, which the Anti-Defamation League says is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history. More: Synagogues around the nation strengthen security following Pittsburgh shooting More: A 97-year-old, an elderly wife and husband: These are the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said the shooting was being considered a federal violation and the FBI would be the primary investigating agency. The FBI helps local jurisdictions investigate related acts like arson or murder and that evidence may be used to bring civil rights charges against a defendant, the Guardian reported. Civil rights is an area of law that falls under the U.S. Justice Department’s purview. More: Pittsburgh synagogue attack worst on worshiping Jews in U.S. history, archivist says More: Suspect charged with 29 counts in 'horrific' synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh According to the U.S. Department of Justice, it’s been enforcing federal hate crimes laws since 1968, when Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the first federal hate crimes statute. “The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice enforces federal statutes that prohibit discrimination based on religion in education, employment, housing, public accommodations, and access to public facilities. In addition, the Civil Rights Division prosecutes bias crimes committed against individuals because of their religion and acts of vandalism and arson against houses of worship,” per the DOJ. Yes. According to the Anti-Defamation League, 45 states — Pennsylvania included — and the District of Columbia have passed hate crime laws, but they vary widely in how a hate crime is defined and prosecuted. But it is not unusual for federal authorities to take control of a hate crimes case of this magnitude, and given the civil rights component, it falls squarely in the purview of federal authorities. More: Questions swirl about motive in fatal shooting at Kentucky Kroger store It’s almost impossible to say due to deficiencies with how the crimes are catalogued. According to FBI data, Pennsylvania counted 61 reported hate crimes in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available. However, hate crimes are underreported here, according to PennLive, which noted the 61 reported hate crimes fell “well below those reported in similar-sized states and fewer than even Utah, which has a population one-quarter that of Pennsylvania.” More: Hate in Pa.: Pittsburgh shooting part of 'white terrorism,' state civil rights watchdog says Against that backdrop, an FBI report on 2016 hate crime statistics in Pennsylvania recorded 14 hate crimes incidents in the Pittsburgh area compared to Philadelphia’s 18. The FBI recorded 11 hate crimes in Pittsburgh motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry, two related to religion, and one related to sexual orientation in 2016. In 2017, ProPublica said the FBI relies on local law enforcement agencies to identify and report crimes motivated by bias, but many agencies fumble this task. Convicting a defendant of a hate crime requires proving the crime was motivated by their hatred of a victim’s or victims’ actual or perceived race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. Often that requires prosecutors introduce evidence of that bias. Perceived bias is covered by federal law. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, signed in 2009, makes it a crime “to willfully cause bodily injury, or attempt to do so using a dangerous weapon, because of the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin.” More: LGBTQ advocates said 'no more' after Matthew Shepard's murder. The hate continued. Benjamin Wagner, former U.S. Attorney for California’s Eastern District, prosecuted dozens of hate crimes throughout his nearly 25-year career and told PBS, “It’s notoriously difficult.” “You need to prove not just the incident, but the state of mind of the defendant — that what they intended was hate-motivated,” Wagner said. “That’s never easy and often involves not just looking at the incident, but going back and investigating the background of the defendant.” In announcing that the U.S. Department of Justice would be filing hate crime charges in this case, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also said they may seek the death penalty for Bowers.

(Oct. 27) AP Vice President Mike Pence speaks in support of Cresent Hardy, Republican candidate for the 4th Congressional District, at a campaign event in Las Vegas. (Photo: Chase Stevens, Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP) Vice President Mike Pence rejected the notion that President Donald Trump's habit of attacking his opponents contributed to the shooting that left 11 people dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday or the bombs that were mailed to a number of political figures last week. "Look, everyone has their own style. And frankly, people on both side of the aisle use strong language about our political differences," Pence told NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard on Saturday when asked if he has ever suggested to Trump to tone down the rhetoric. "But I just don't think you can connect it to threats or acts of violence, Vaughn. And I don't think the American people connect it." A 46-year-old man is accused of entering the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday and opening fire in the deadliest attack on Jewish Americans practicing their beliefs in U.S. history. In addition to the 11 worshippers who were killed, six others were wounded, including four police officers who responded to the scene. The suspect, Robert Bowers, had been posting anti-Semitic rants on social media. And last week, pipe bombs were mailed to more than a dozen prominent political figures, most of them connected with the Democratic Party. Several media and political voices have warned that the president's language could inspire troubled people to commit acts of violence. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge – a Republican who became the first person to head the Department of Homeland Security after it was created in response to the 9/11 attacks – called the recent events "a tragic manifestation of divisive, mean and intolerant civic leadership." "The violence, bigotry and hate of the last few days has me distraught and upset, with my country and our leaders. First it was the targeting of politicians and journalists with weapons of destruction, soon followed by the murder of defenseless worshippers observing the Sabbath," Ridge said in a tweet from the account of his consulting firm, Ridge Global. He continued, without naming specific politicians: "Too many of our civic leaders no longer speak to the better angels of our nation." "I am so proud and grateful to be an American citizen yet am concerned about the direction our leaders are taking us. We must demand more than simply condemning these actions with empty rhetoric," he said. Both incidents are assaults not only against humanity, but also our Constitution. It is a tragic manifestation of divisive, mean and intolerant civic leadership. My heart aches for the horrible and painful loss these victims and their families have experienced, not to mention... On Saturday, Hillyard asked Pence if he was "complicit" in Trump's inflammatory rhetoric if he did not try to persuade the president to change. Pence conceded that he and the president "have different styles," but he said Trump "connected to the American people because he spoke plainly." "We need to be very careful" before we make any connection between political debate and "the kind of violent behavior we witnessed in Pittsburgh," the "threats of violence against prominent Americans that we witnessed in the pipe bombs" or other recent mass shootings, Pence said. The vice president cautioned that people need to recognize the difference between "passionate debate and acts of violence and evil." Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also condemned the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting as "evil." "This was a pure act of evil," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace when asked if the shooting was a terrorist act or a hate crime. "You’ve heard that from the president and vice president yesterday, that’s what it is. We all condemn this in the strongest terms possible." Nielsen said DHS officials had been to the Tree of Life Synagogue as recently as March when a protective security adviser visited the site. Nielsen stressed the need for planning for shooting incidents because every location is different and because "in such events, there is rarely time to think through roles and responsibilities. The response has got to be automatic." After the shooting, Trump suggested that "an armed guard inside the temple" might have prevented the tragedy. Pittsburgh's Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto, a member of the gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, disagreed. "I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or schools filled with armed guards," Peduto said during an interview Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." On Saturday, Trump tweeted that "all of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans." Trump also condemned the shooting as an "evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate." ...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Authorities say a gunman opened fire during a baby naming ceremony Saturday morning at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. The suspected gunman behind Saturday’s shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead and six more injured, has been formally charged, prosecutors said. Robert Bowers, 46, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts of crimes of violence and firearms offenses after authorities say he carried out an anti-Semitic attack on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath. The bloody attack brought swift condemnation from President Trump and other leaders, and inspired a grim vigil in the city on Saturday night that attracted thousands. Bowers is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer; and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The suspect also faces a list of local charges, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said police were dispatched to Tree of Life Synagogue at 9:55 a.m. after receiving calls describing an active-shooter situation in the city's predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He confirmed the 11 deaths -- none of them children. As for the injury tally, he said it did not include the shooter, who was taken to the hospital after being taken into custody. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center officials said a 61-year-old woman was among the injured. Her injuries were described as “extremity soft tissue injuries that required cleaning in the operating room.” She is said to be in good condition and recovering. Another victim was ID'd as a 70-year-old male with gunshot wounds to his torso “involving major organs in his abdomen.” He was undergoing his second operation and in critical condition, hospital officials said. Police Chief Scott Schubert said that two police officers were hit during initial contact with the shooter and that two SWAT team members were also struck “during an engagement inside the building.” He confirmed that all four law enforcement officials are in stable condition. Officials said there were multiple fatalities and six people injured in the shooting on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (AP) The FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, Bob Jones, said that it was the most “horrific crime scene” he’s witnessed in his 22-year career with the bureau. Jones said that the victims were targeted “simply because of their faith,” but that Bowers’ full motive was as yet unknown. Bowers is said to have shouted that "all Jews must die" as he sprayed bullets, according to KDKA-TV. The attack took place during a baby naming ceremony on Shabbat, what is traditionally the busiest of days for synagogues. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that the FBI is investigating the shooting as “a hate crime.” That was reinforced on Saturday evening by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said the Justice Department intends to file hate-crime and other charges over an act he deemed "reprehensible and repugnant to the values of this nation." Authorities believe the suspect acted alone. “At this point we have no knowledge that Bowers was known to law enforcement before today,” Jones added. Hours after the deadly shooting, thousands gathered at an intersection in the light rain to grieve for those killed and wounded. "We'll be dealing with this for months and years," said State Rep. Dan Frankel, who represents the synagogue's district and was speaking a block away when the gunfire began. "It leaves an indelible mark." In the afternoon appearance in Indianapolis, President Trump, who said he'd been in contact with the mayor and governor over the tragedy, called the shooting a wicked, anti-Semitic act of "pure evil." First responders were seen near the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa., where a shooter opened fire Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (AP) First lady Melania Trump, like her husband, tweeted about the shooting Saturday. “My heart breaks over the news out of Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America,” she wrote. Meanwhile, police in New York and Los Angeles said they would be deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities. During Saturday night's memorial, there was no shortage of prayers and singing. There was also anger, and a "vote, vote, vote" chant broke out during an emotional gathering at which some derided the nation's political climate. Several attendees blamed the shooting on the nation's deepening political and social rifts, and said they took little solace in a planned visit by Trump. Governor Wolf attended the vigil, suspending a campaign bus trip after learning of the attack. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-world-series-tweet_us_5bd58f45e4b0d38b58845e5b---split---Mere hours after a deadly mass shooting at a Pennsylvania synagogue, President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Saturday night to talk about baseball. The president, who’d apparently tuned in to watch Game 4 of the World Series, called out Los Angeles Dodgers’ manager Dave Roberts in his late night posting. The Dodgers lost the game to the Boston Red Sox, 9-6, after having a 4-0 lead, and Trump questioned Roberts’ managerial moves. Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! Some supporters said Trump — who has a history of tweeting about sports — saw nothing wrong with Trump commenting on the World Series despite the tragedy earlier in the day ― a shooting that stands as one of the most lethal attacks targeting the Jewish community in U.S. history. But many Twitter users accused the president of insensitivity, given that a gunman had killed at least 11 people and wounded six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. “As a guy living in Pittsburgh, let me just ask: is watching the World Series really the best use of your time this evening?” one Twitter user responded to Trump.  Hey, as a guy living in Pittsburgh, let me just ask: is watching the #WorldSeries really the best use of your time this evening? Even if it’s what you care most about, do you think it’s any solace to the families of those killed today to know that THIS is what’s on your mind? The president’s hometown newspaper, the New York Daily News, also chastised the baseball tweet. “Trump felt the need to weigh in on the World Series on a day when the president should have had much more pressing issues to attend to,” the paper’s sports staff wrote in an editorial. On a tragic day in America, President Donald Trump felt the need to tweet about the #WorldSeries: https://t.co/E0YJIFGq3B pic.twitter.com/FH7Klcq2CQ Here are some of the other comments: I can't believe this is real. On the day of a mass shooting, Trump goes a rally and live tweets the #WorldSeries game. What a time to be alive. https://t.co/SVf1m4SIfQ How about you leave your current position and look into managing a baseball team or two... I think you meant to say: I am having a real difficult time sleeping tonight. The horrible events of today are weighing heavily on my mind. I can’t help but to take some of the blame for this terrible politically charged time we are in. I’m sorry and I will do better. As for Roberts, he pushed back against Trump’s criticism, saying that while he was happy the president had tuned in to watch the game, his remarks were but “one man’s opinion.” Trump has repeatedly come under scrutiny in recent days for his responses to news events. On Friday, the same day a man was arrested in connection with bombs sent to several prominent Democrats and Trump critics, the president was criticized for bashing the media and “Crooked Hillary Clinton” at a North Carolina rally. His remarks prompted the crowd to chant “CNN sucks!” and “lock her up!” Both CNN and Clinton were targets of the bomb mailings last week. The president was also lambasted for joking about wanting to cancel two public engagements on Saturday — not because of the mass shooting but out of vanity. “I said, ‘Maybe I should cancel this arrangement because I have a bad hair day,’” Trump said at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, where he appeared after the shooting. “And the bad news ― somebody said, ‘Actually it looks better than it usually does.’” Dear Donald: 11 people were brutally murdered today in Pittsburgh. And all you can find to do is go to a campaign rally, make jokes about almost canceling it because of bad hair, and then tweet about a pitching decision in the World Series. Your a sad case for a POTUS. Trump jokes that he considered cancelling speech to FFA not b/c of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, but b/c his hair got wet while talking w/reporters about the shooting. "At least you know it's mine... I said, 'maybe I should cancel this arrangement b/c I have a bad hair day.'" pic.twitter.com/wLIlqQpENj Trump was also roundly mocked on social media for his suggestion that an armed guard could’ve “stopped” the synagogue shooter, who officials said wielded an assault-style rifle in his rampage. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Trump addressed the Future Farmers of America Convention in Washington. The locale was Indianapolis.

Pence was answering a question about the caravan that is making its way through Mexico in an attempt to enter the U.S. Ron Sachs—Pool/Getty Images When President Donald Trump tweeted Monday that “the Caravan heading to the Southern Border” had “unknown Middle Easterners … mixed in,” the machinery of the federal government kicked in to reverse-engineer data to support his claim.

---split---7.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMOGZ-QowrvLgAg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---Democrats have religiously deferred to special counsel Robert Mueller over the last 17 months, hamstrung by their lack of congressional power and expressing faith that the respected investigator will get the job done if left alone. That could all change after November. If Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections, they’re prepared to use their newfound subpoena power to aggressively open probes into President Donald Trump’s finances and connections to Russia. But doing so — just as Mueller appears to be entering the final laps of his own probe — would create tensions between the s... President Donald Trump could see up to six Cabinet officials depart in the weeks after next month’s midterm elections, according to interviews with a half-dozen current and former Trump officials and Republicans close to the White House. For a president who has already shed or shuffled up eight Cabinet officials, that would make for the highest turnover rate in recent history. It would also be a major disruption even by the standards of an ever-churning administration — possibly creating new confusion across departments and agencies and risking multiple bloody Senate confirmation fights. Th... Democrats eager to investigate the Trump administration if they seize the House would have the GOP to thank for one of their most potent tools — a sweeping subpoena authority that Democratic lawmakers denounced as an abusive power grab three years ago. House Republicans changed the rules in 2015 to allow many of their committee chairmen to issue subpoenas without consulting the minority party, overriding Democrats objections that likened the tactic to something out of the McCarthy era. Now the weapon that the GOP wielded dozens of times against Barack Obama’s agencies could allow Democrats ... The throngs of protesters who stormed Capitol Hill late last month didn’t succeed in keeping Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. But they did furnish Donald Trump and the Republicans with an election-season message to energize their base. Ever since Americans saw the atria and corridors of the Senate buildings teem with foot soldiers of the resistance, the president and other Republicans have been trying to stoke fears of social chaos with overblown rhetoric comparing Democrats to a mob. “The only way to shut down the Democrats new Mob Rule strategy is to stop them cold at the Ballot Box... President Donald Trump on Saturday said that a fatal shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier in the day has proved to be "far more devastating" than local officials initially feared, as authorities identified a suspect held in custody. “It looks like the results are coming in, and they're far more devastating than anybody originally thought in the morning,” the president told reporters at a news conference at Joint Base Andrews. “In the morning, they thought that it was a shooter, but they had the shooter, they soon would, but the results are very devastating. You're seeing the numbers c... Hours after calling for a more civil national discourse in the wake of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump on Sunday ridiculed one of the targets of a spate of pipe bombs sent to high-profile members of the Democratic Party last week. Following an appearance by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the president derided the billionaire liberal activist as “Wacky” and criticized his performance in the morning-show interview, conducted by journalist Jake Tapper. “Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be inte... As the 2018 midterm election cycle enters its final days, a time-honored election tradition is hitting its stride. Contenders for public office are taking to television studios and university campuses across the country to duke it out with their general election rivals, making a final pitch to voters before Nov. 6. POLITICO steps into the arena to show you some of the political sparring matches that have unfolded in just the past week. A caravan of Central American immigrants headed for the U.S. through Mexico "is not getting in," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vows. "My general message to this caravan is: Do not come," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "You will not be allowed in." "There is a right way to immigrate to the United States," she added, "and this is not it." Since its formation, the caravan has reportedly swelled to more than 7,000 people. But its size is nothing new, Nielsen said. "We have a crisis at the border right now ... [and] this caravan is one iteration of that," Nielsen said. "Frankly, ... MISSOULA, Mont. — The Trump family has not forgotten about Sen. Jon Tester’s role in bringing down Ronny Jackson. In his tour barnstorming the state on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, Donald Trump Jr. on Saturday repeatedly lashed Tester for unveiling numerous allegations of misconduct against the former Veteran Affairs nominee, who also serves as a White House doctor. Trump Jr. even said that the Secret Service agents that protect him “can’t stand” Tester’s role in derailing his nomination, during an appearance in rural Ronan. “Jon Tester talks a big game on vets.

Anti-Semitism has "moved from the margins into the mainstream," Anti-Defamation League CEO and National Director Jonathan Greenblatt said Sunday. His remarks on NBC's "Meet the Press" came a day after a gunman fatally shot 11 and injured seven others in Pittsburgh in the deadliest attack on a synagogue in U.S. history. The tragedy can be linked to concurrent political rhetoric, Greenblatt said. "Political candidates and people in public life now lineally repeat the rhetoric of white supremacists," Greenblatt said. "They think it's normal and permissible to talk about Jewish conspiracies, ma... The chairmen of the Republican and Democratic congressional campaign committees called for political unity Sunday in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

The Department of Homeland Security is "more prepared than we've ever been" to ensure the security of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says. "The goal here ... is absolutely to assure Americans that their votes will count and their votes will be counted correctly," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "We are constantly monitoring, constantly working with them, sharing information." Among other measures , Nielsen said, her department will be establishing a "virtual Situation Room."

It should be "up to the families themselves" whether President Donald Trump attends any memorial event for those killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Mayor Bill Peduto said Sunday.

Local and federal law enforcement officials said Sunday that the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue entered the building Saturday morning making statements about genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people as congregants were in the middle of worship.

A Department of Homeland Security adviser visited the Pittsburgh synagogue that was the site of a mass shooting Saturday "as recently as March," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says. "We actually conducted a site visit there with our protective security adviser in the area," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "This is something we often do." "We feel that the best way to help communities support their efforts in terms of protection is to be there, to be there on the ground, to listen to them, to understand their needs." Protective security advisers are "trained critical infrastruc... HAMILTON, Mont. — Sen. Rand Paul says he’s not going to let Saudi Arabia off the hook after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Turkey by agents linked to the Saudi government. The Kentucky Republican said Saturday he’s intent on forcing another vote to block billions in arm sales to the autocratic Middle Eastern kingdom and won’t settle for targeted sanctions, seeking to capitalize on negative public sentiment surrounding the Oct. 2 killing. “Are we going to do fake sanctions? Are we going to pretend to do something by putting sanctions on 15 thugs. Or are we going to do something tha... Trump White House and administration officials are furious that the union representing a key Trump constituency — Border Patrol agents — endorsed three Senate Democrats. It's an “egregious” action on “the existential issue of this election,”one White House official told POLITICO. The focus of administration ire is Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents 14,000border agents and support personnel. In allowing his union to endorse Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Judd behaved in a manner that was "self-serving,"... More than a dozen House Democrats are urging Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to condemn Brazil’s far-right presidential candidate for encouraging political violence, showing a lack of commitment to democracy and attacking minority communities. The lawmakers, led by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Cal) and including Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Rep. James McGovern (D-Mass.), in their letter dated Friday call Jair Bolsonaro a “far-right extremist” who has said he will not accept the election results if he loses. Because none of the 13 candidates for Brazil’s presidency secured 50 percent of the vote req... MIAMI — Gov. Rick Scott has decided to return to the campaign trail by standing shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump — a close ally whose support Scott has downplayed in recent months — when the president comes to Florida on Halloween. Scott announced after Hurricane Michael hit Oct. 10 that he was indefinitely suspending campaign trail appearances in his Senate bid against Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson so he could focus on storm recovery. The decision dovetailed with what one Republican insider had groused was a “keep away from Trump” strategy, in which the governor appeared with the ... In this political environment, it’s easy to look at Republicans and Democrats as having next to nothing in common. Regardless of the issue at hand, we see them as wanting completely different things—especially when it comes to issues of sex and sexuality. From differences in the way they have approached the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to their views on abortion and same-sex marriage, Democrats and Republicans appear worlds apart. It’s not just their public policy positions that seem to differ wildly, though. According to the largest and most comp... People are worried about what’s happening on the internet—and they should be. In just the past few months, Americans have seen massive social turmoil over the deletion of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ accounts from digital platforms; the public disclosure of criminal charges for Russian interference in the upcoming midterm elections; and other continuing developments in disinformation operations, such as the the Kremlin’s new digital campaign to turn U.S. public opinion against taking military action against Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. But these latest incidents are only part of a far... Megyn Kelly’s elopement with NBC was a marriage that almost nobody wanted to see work. Her new colleagues at the network resented the $20 million annual salaryshe reportedly collected upon arriving at the network in 2017. Today show veterans viewed new show, Megyn Kelly Today as an interloper that succeeded only in garnering worse ratings than an existing show in the Today franchise (Today’s Take) in the network’s line-up. Liberals and centrists found outrage in a conservative media star from the Fox News Channel being rewarded with a prestigious broadcast slot. Many fans of her old Fox sho... INDIAN TRAIL, N.C.—The other day, under a bright blue sky, a woman in a red shirt and a red hat stood outside the Hemby Bridge Volunteer Fire Department and distributed pamphlets touting Republican candidates to arriving early voters. “May I share some information with you?” retired teacher Ginny Shaffer asked again and again.

Democrat Brian Forde raised nearly half a million dollars of bitcoin for his unsuccessful bid for a California congressional seat this year, but then had to field questions from election watchdogs about a contribution from Hong Kong. Republican Austin Petersen, a U.S. Senate candidate from Missouri, received the largest single bitcoin donation in federal election history, but was forced to return the virtual currency in June because it exceeded federal contribution limits.

In federal penitentiaries across the nation, prisoners eagerly awaiting a transfer to halfway houses say they are being told that they will have to wait weeks or months longer than they had anticipated because there is a shortage of beds at the transitional group homes. But that’s not true. According to inmates, halfway house staff and industry officials, scores of beds lie empty, with some estimates of at least 1,000 vacant spaces. They remain unused due to a series of decisions that have sharply reduced the number of prisoners sent to halfway houses. And home confinement, a federal arrang... The United States was founded on the premise that all individuals are created equal, with certain unalienable rights. Throughout our history, Americans have fought and died for these rights. They are ingrained in the fabric of our society and regularly debated, whether in coffee shops on Main Street or the halls of Congress. Those fundamental rights and freedoms are part of our national identity, but that’s not the case in other parts of the world. That’s why for more than a century, the United States has been a vocal supporter, not just rhetorically but financially, as well, of global huma... The press gave primo coverage to Donald Trump’s outrageous utterances during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries because, well, he was a front-runner, and when front-runners speak, it’s news. After Trump secured the Republican nomination, the press gave similar notice to his tongue-wagging because—well, because it believes every trill and chirrup from a major-party nominee contains news value. Later, when Trump became president and the press continued to steer his tweets, White House lawn utterances, and MAGA-rally speeches onto Page One, the justification for the saturation coverage... The three-way test of wills over Saudi Arabia’s murder of an exiled journalist has started to play out in oil markets. Each day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintains his drip feed of grisly details of Jamal Khashoggi’s killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Each day, a reluctant President Donald Trump is forced to respond to a new revelation. The affair has betrayed a yet unseen presidential aptitude for restraint. Meanwhile, the Saudis’ initially combative tone has been quietly replaced with a more deferential stance. They have opened the valves on their idled oil producti... The second most startling aspect of the drama surrounding the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi—second only to the heart-stopping brutality of the act—has been the sheer enormity of its impact. Much to the perpetrators’ alarm, the assassination of a man whose name most people had never heard before has sent shockwaves across the world, rocking geopolitical alliances, uniting unlikely foes, and outraging observers in the United States and around the world. Tuesday’s speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, calling the killing a “ferocious” and planned murder, rather than t... Warren Buffett's Nevada energy utility is clobbering Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson in a power struggle over the fate of the state's electricity supply. The Omaha investor and the Las Vegas gambling magnate are on opposite sides of a Nevada ballot measure that could rattle the electric power industry: Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns NV Energy,a government-regulated monopoly that ranks as the state's largest utility. And Adelson is bankrolling a campaign to break up the company and take control of where his power-hungry casinos buy electricity. The fight has drawn more political mone... Minnesota hasn’t elected a Republican attorney general in over 40 years. Keith Ellison — the prominent Democratic congressman and No. 2 at the Democratic National Committee — is putting that streak to the test. Rocked by accusations of domestic abuse, Ellison has fallen behind former Minnesota Republican state legislator Doug Wardlow, according to a poll this week. And while each candidate has tagged the other as too far outside the mainstream to be the state's top law enforcement official, in reality the race revolves around Ellison and what voters make of the misconduct allegations he’s f... KENOSHA, Wisc. — Want to know just how important Wisconsin is in the midterm election? Take a look at the political luminaries who visited over the last six days. Sen. Kamala Harris on Sunday. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday. President Donald Trump on Wednesday. And, the biggest prize of all for Democrats, former President Barack Obama on Friday. With a tight contest for Speaker Paul Ryan’s open congressional seat, a competitive Senate race and a battle for governor that is about as close as it can get, the state that slipped through Democrats’ hands in the 2016 presidential election is getti... Liberal groups working to retake the House and Senate outraised their GOP counterparts in early October, new disclosures showed Thursday, as enthusiasm continued to translate into massive piles of cash for the Democratic Party in the final stretch of midterm campaigning. GOP fundraisers said in recent weeks that the battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation galvanized their donors and gave the party momentum. But the largest Democratic committees and super PACs still outstripped them, raising $82.5 million in the first 17 days of October, compared to $73.9 million for... President Donald Trump by his own admission toned down his fiery political rhetoric at a rally in southern Illinois on Saturday evening, following a fatal mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The president delivered few of his trademark blistering attacks on his political rivals or adversarial groups during the rally at the 8,000-seat Murphysboro airport hangar to boost statewide political allies ahead of the midterm elections, delivering a largely aspirational address. Although Trump frequently insults the members of the media on site to cover his remarks, the president resisted cri... The would-be terrorist who failed to harm CNN and George Soros did succeed at one thing: ruining President Donald Trump’s week. Trump had hoped to capitalize on growing Republican enthusiasm in the final weeks of the midterm campaign — stoking fears of a Central American migrant caravan and hoping his Thursday unveiling of a plan to lower prescription drug prices would hold the news media’s attention heading into the weekend. But even Trump can’t shape the media narrative to his will amid an attempt at mass political assassination and a nationwide manhunt. "It didn’t get the kind of coverag... Authorities on Friday charged a man who appeared to be an emphatic supporter of President Donald Trump with sending suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics, while the president expressed frustration that the attacks were distracting from the midterms. The FBI arrested Cesar Sayoc, a 56-year-old Florida man, and charged him with five federal crimes — from mailing explosives to threatening former presidents — that carry a sentence of up to 58 years in prison. The federal complaint included 13 explosive devices that were bound for high-profile Democrats and CNN. It also detailed how mis... President Donald Trump on Friday evening accused the media of using a nationwide bomb-threat scare to "score political points against me" and the GOP ahead of the midterm elections. "We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party," Trump told supporters during a rally in Charlotte, N.C., alluding to the actions of a fervent Trump supporter who was arrested and charged Friday for allegedly sending 14 potentially explosive devices to prominent Democrats from Barack Obama to Robert ... The Trump administration faces an uphill battle to make its plan to lower Medicare drug costs a reality, with resistance coming from its own party, Democrats and large segments of the health care industry. Conservatives and the drug industry say it’s tantamount to government price controls and socialized medicine. Democrats are beating up the president for not going far enough and doctors are worried their patients could lose access to critical medicines. The Trump team will have to tackle political, legal and administrative obstacles, all while keeping voters enthused about a wonky plan th... President Donald Trump tried Thursday to make good on a campaign vow to lower drug prices — attacking “foreign freeloaders” and proposing significant changes to how Medicare pays for many drugs. But his populist proposal didn’t appear likely to budge the national debate around health care, just days ahead of the midterm elections. Early indications are that it won’t be an immediate game changer — it’s too wonky for Republicans playing defense in local races, it gave Democrats a fresh opportunity to slam the administration‘s attacks on patient protections and it won’t help most voters pay le... BOSTON—One Sunday night two years ago, Marc Ebuña and Ari Ofsevit stayed up past 1 a.m. to watch the city’s transit system grind to a pointless halt. Sitting in their respective apartments, they were monitoring a website that tracks Boston’s rapid-transit trains in real time. “I live-tweeted the late-night ballet, the last-trains ballet,” Ebuña says. Except what they were seeing was more of a citywide muscle spasm than an elegant dance. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority barely acknowledged this nightly jam, and wasn’t doing anything about it. So Ebuna and Ofsevit, who had plent... To be a millennial in Boston means putting yourself at the mercy of one of the oldest and least well-funded transit systems in America. A common thread is running through nearly every tech debate in Washington these days: fear that an ambitious China is poised to win the next wave of technology. The worry that China is preparing to eat America’s lunch is the subtext for nearly all policy discussions on next-generation tech like quantum computing that can break encryption, artificial intelligence that can spy on or supplant humans, and super-fast wireless networks that can power an advanced digital economy. And it's causing rattled U.S. policymakers to flirt with some of the same top-down, regimented strategies that Beijing ... For more than 10 years, Aaron Belkin slowly and methodically worked to shift public opinion on “don’t ask, don’t tell,” chipping away at the hardened view that openly gay Americans had no place in the military. When the law was repealed in 2011, the San Francisco State University political science professor felt vindication in his belief that an aggressive communications campaign can bring success to long-shot causes. Now Belkin has a new target: the Supreme Court. Belkin and fellow academic-activists have launched the 1/20/21 Project, which aims to add four seats to the Supreme Court soon ... PORTSMOUTH, Ohio — Two years after Ohio swooned over Donald Trump’s law-and-order presidential campaign, the state is weighing a decidedly un-Trumplike solution to its spiraling opioid epidemic: Stop locking up drug users, and instead use the money to treat them. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray is embracing a proposal on the ballot that would downgrade all drug possession crimes to misdemeanors and prohibit jail time for all but the most frequent offenders, a move that has put him out of step with key state officials and even some in his own party — and sets up a test of ... President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Democrats are threatening to endanger patients with pre-existing conditions while Republicans will protect them — an assertion at odds with his administration’s own persistent efforts to dismantle Obamacare. “Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican,” Trump tweeted, part of a ramp-up of his rhetoric on health care ahead of the midterm elections. Public health experts say his claims are inaccurate, given his administration's moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act's safeguards...

---split---7.0---split---http://www.marketwatch.com/story/multiple-people-dead-at-synagogue-in-suburban-pittsburgh-2018-10-27?mod=hp_LATEST---split---Published: Oct 28, 2018 9:22 a.m. ET 46-year-old suspect was not previously known to law enforcement By Eleven people were dead after a shooting Saturday morning at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and six were injured, including four law-enforcement members, according to municipal, state and federal officials who appeared at a late-afternoon news conference. No children were among the dead. The suspect, identified by law enforcement and local media as 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident Robert Bowers, was also injured. Bowers late Saturday was charged with 29 federal counts, including hate-crime and firearm offenses. Police were first called, officials said, at 9:54 a.m. on Saturday regarding an active-shooter situation at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the heavily populated residential area of Squirrel Hill and the first officers were dispatched to the synagogue a minute later. Two police officers were injured in an initial exchange with the shooter,, and two others, SWAT team members, were injured later in the incident. The suspect,who appeared pending further investigation to have acted alone ultimately surrendered, officials said. Bowers legally owned all his weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s in-charge agent, the entire deadly incident lasted 20 minutes. Bowers, whom officials revealed at the news conference was previously unknown to law enforcement, was said to have posted numerous messages of racial hatred on social media, including one as recently as Saturday morning, the Jewish sabbath, saying, in part: “Screw your optics. I’m going in.” CBS News reported that the shooter shouted, “All Jews must die,” during the attack. An official at the news conference said the suspect was in possession inside the synagogue of an assault rifle — local media reports described it as an AR-15–style rifle — along with three handguns. In addition to his antisemitic postings, including some on the Gab site, reputedly a favorite of the alt-right, Bowers was said to have been critical of President Donald Trump, whom he is believed to have viewed as not sufficiently ethnonationalist. “There is no #MAGA,” reads a Bowers post from this week on Gab, “as long as there is a [anti-Jewish slur] infestation.” The attack is being investigated as a hate crime, said Gov. Tom Wolf at the news conference late Saturday. Wolf said mass shootings cannot be accepted as a standard feature of American life. Bowers was reported to be receiving medical treatment. Earlier Saturday, the governor described in a tweet what officials of the commonwealth had initially learned, saying: “We are still learning details about the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh but it is a serious situation.” We are still learning details about the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh but it is a serious situation. @PAStatePolice are assisting local first responders. Please stay away from the area and keep the congregants and law enforcement in your prayers. President Donald Trump tweeted that he, too, was watching the tragic events unfold: Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All! Wolf later tweeted that he was headed to the scene: On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need. Trump added in brief comments to journalists that something “has to be done” about the atmosphere of hatred in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, suggesting, as he has in the past, that armed guards inside the synagogue may have created a different outcome in Saturday’s tragedy. Trump: "It's just a shame. To watch this and to see this, for so many years, so much of it, is absolutely a shame." Later, after flying to Indianapolis, Trump told a Future Farmers of America conference that, in memory of the Pittsburgh dead, a future of justice, safety and tolerance should be fought for, before going on to talk about the trade, tax and other policies of his administration that he characterized as agriculture-friendly. He went on to speak disparaging of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and to lament his unlikelihood of winning a Nobel prize: Trump seemed to be semi-arguing with his speechwriter out loud here. https://t.co/Jo9g1g7aDw ! Trump praises Norman Borlaug for his Nobel Peace Prize, then says, "They probably will never give it to me, even what I'm doing in Korea, and Idlib province, and all these places. They probably will never give it to me. You know why? Because they don't want toooo." Trump headed from the youth event in Indianapolis to a political rally in Murphysboro, Ill., on Saturday night. The White House, and Trump himself per his remarks in Indianapolis, had reportedly mulled canceling the rally in light of the synagogue shooting but decided to go forward with it, saying, according to CBS, “We can’t let evil change our life and change our schedule.” Early in the day, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that the White House was monitoring the event, and first lady Melania Trump said, also on Twitter, that she was heartbroken over the mass shooting and that the “violence needs to stop”: Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all. My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America. There were reportedly three services being held simultaneously at the synagogue, a house of worship for multiple congregations, at the time of the attack, according to reports early Saturday.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-scorned-tweeting-world-series-130440532.html---split---Mere hours after a deadly mass shooting at a Pennsylvania synagogue, President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Saturday night to talk about baseball. The president, who’d apparently tuned in to watch Game 4 of the World Series, called out Los Angeles Dodgers’ manager Dave Roberts in his late night posting. The Dodgers lost the game to the Boston Red Sox, 9-6, after having a 4-0 lead, and Trump questioned Roberts’ managerial moves. Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! Some supporters said Trump — who has a history of tweeting about sports — saw nothing wrong with Trump commenting on the World Series despite the tragedy earlier in the day ― a shooting that stands as one of the most lethal attacks targeting the Jewish community in U.S. history. But many Twitter users accused the president of insensitivity, given that a gunman had killed at least 11 people and wounded six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. “As a guy living in Pittsburgh, let me just ask: is watching the World Series really the best use of your time this evening?” one Twitter user responded to Trump.  Hey, as a guy living in Pittsburgh, let me just ask: is watching the #WorldSeries really the best use of your time this evening? Even if it’s what you care most about, do you think it’s any solace to the families of those killed today to know that THIS is what’s on your mind? The president’s hometown newspaper, the New York Daily News, also chastised the baseball tweet. “Trump felt the need to weigh in on the World Series on a day when the president should have had much more pressing issues to attend to,” the paper’s sports staff wrote in an editorial. On a tragic day in America, President Donald Trump felt the need to tweet about the #WorldSeries: https://t.co/E0YJIFGq3Bpic.twitter.com/FH7Klcq2CQ Here are some of the other comments: I can't believe this is real. On the day of a mass shooting, Trump goes a rally and live tweets the #WorldSeries game. What a time to be alive. https://t.co/SVf1m4SIfQ How about you leave your current position and look into managing a baseball team or two... I think you meant to say: I am having a real difficult time sleeping tonight. The horrible events of today are weighing heavily on my mind. I can’t help but to take some of the blame for this terrible politically charged time we are in. I’m sorry and I will do better. As for Roberts, he pushed back against Trump’s criticism, saying that while he was happy the president had tuned in to watch the game, his remarks were but “one man’s opinion.” Trump has repeatedly come under scrutiny in recent days for his responses to news events. On Friday, the same day a man was arrested in connection with bombs sent to several prominent Democrats and Trump critics, the president was criticized for bashing the media and “Crooked Hillary Clinton” at a North Carolina rally. His remarks prompted the crowd to chant “CNN sucks!” and “lock her up!” Both CNN and Clinton were targets of the bomb mailings last week. The president was also lambasted for joking about wanting to cancel two public engagements on Saturday — not because of the mass shooting but out of vanity. “I said, ‘Maybe I should cancel this arrangement because I have a bad hair day,’” Trump said at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, where he appeared after the shooting. “And the bad news ― somebody said, ‘Actually it looks better than it usually does.’” Dear Donald: 11 people were brutally murdered today in Pittsburgh. And all you can find to do is go to a campaign rally, make jokes about almost canceling it because of bad hair, and then tweet about a pitching decision in the World Series. Your a sad case for a POTUS. Trump jokes that he considered cancelling speech to FFA not b/c of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, but b/c his hair got wet while talking w/reporters about the shooting. "At least you know it's mine... I said, 'maybe I should cancel this arrangement b/c I have a bad hair day.'" pic.twitter.com/wLIlqQpENj Trump was also roundly mocked on social media for his suggestion that an armed guard could’ve “stopped” the synagogue shooter, who officials said wielded an assault-style rifle in his rampage. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Trump addressed the Future Farmers of America Convention in Washington. The locale was Indianapolis.

Official results gave Bolsonaro a 56 percent share of the vote in Sunday's runoff, comfortably ahead of Fernando Haddad, the candidate of the centre-left Workers' Party (PT), who had 44 percent. Bolsonaro gave an internet address via Facebook Live, shunning a traditional press conference due to security concerns. In September, he suffered a near fatal stabbing at a campaign rally.

The 60-year-old retail entrepreneur's helicopter burst into flames shortly after taking off from the football field on Saturday at the team's King Power stadium. The club's statement on Sunday did not name the other four victims. "In Khun Vichai, the world has lost a great man. A man of kindness, of generosity and a man whose life was defined by the love he devoted to his family and those he so successfully led," the statement said. ...

Hamilton, 33, had needed only five points to be sure of the title while four times champion Vettel had to win to have any hope of denying the Briton. "That's how you do it,...

Khashoggi - a Saudi writer, US resident, and Washington Post columnist - entered the building on October 2 to obtain documentation certifying he had divorced his ex-wife so he could remarry.

Colombo, Sri Lanka - One person has been killed and two others wounded in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, when the bodyguard of a minister in the cabinet of deposed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe opened fire at a crowd of protesters.

French-born Salome Zurabishvili is projected to be elected with 52.3 percent of votes, according to the exit polls funded by the ruling Georgian Dream party that is backing her, with anti-corruption Grigol Vashadze of the main opposition party expected to secure only 28.1 percent.

A helicopter belonging to Leicester City football club owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, has crashed in a ball of flames in the club's car park, according to British media.

The helicopter just cleared the top of the stadium before spiralling out of control and plummeting to the ground and exploding, witnesses told Reuters news agency. Lei...

A four-way summit on Syria has ended with no major breakthrough, even as the leaders of Turkey, Russia, Germany and France agreed that a fragile ceasefire in Idlib should be preserved and said a committee tasked with drafting the war-torn country's new constitution needs to convene by the end of the year. Saturday's meeting in Istanbul was aimed at laying the groundwork for an eventual peace plan in a country devastated by more than seven years of war. In a joint communique following their meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emm...

WASHINGTON – The head of the Anti-Defamation League is sounding an alarm that antisemitism has become normalized in America’s political discourse, following an historic massacre of Jews in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday. Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the ADL, said that antisemitic dog whistles long held at the fringes of American political life have entered the mainstream at little cost. “... The vigils were held in Jerusalem's Zion Square and Tel Aviv's Rabin Square Some 500 Americans and Israelis gathered Sunday night to sing somber songs in Hebrew and English at Jerusalem’s Zion Square in a candle-lit vigil in memory of the 11 victims of Saturday’s massacre at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh organized by The Meeting Place Dialogue Group, The Jerusalem Movement and the Hartman Institute Hevruta program.

Antisemitism has been on the rise since 2014 – meaning before Trump became or even announced that he was running for president – but spiked by nearly 70% in 2017. “This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside they might have been able to stop [the shooter] immediately,” US President Donald Trump said on Saturday, after the Sabbath massacre at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Later he tweeted, “This evil antisemitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of antisemitism from our world. We must unite ... The violence broke 34 hours of calm, after a violent weekend in which Palestinians in Gaza fired 37 rockets at Israel and the IDF hit 95 military targets in the Hamas ruled enclave. An IDF aircraft struck a terror cell of three that attempted to infiltrate the southern border on Sunday night, just one day after the Islamic Jihad declared that a truce had been reached with Israel. The men had placed an explosive device by the barrier, the IDF said. Palestinian media reported that three people had been killed in the strike, with initial reports that they could have been minors. The violence b... No matter which side of the political spectrum one identifies with, there’s a convenient and convincing argument that cynically exploits the deaths of the Pittsburgh Jews to put forth their agenda. There is no Right or Left when assessing the reasons for how the groundwork could be paved for such a horrendous act as Saturday’s Pittsburgh massacre. In the worst mass attack on Jews in US history, 11 people, most of them worshipers, were killed when a gunman, apparently poisoned with timeless anti-Jewish tropes and vitriol, entered the Etz Haim Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill suburb of Pittsbur... Readers of the Jerusalem Post have their say. Shabbat massacre To use the horrific massacre that took place in the synagogue in Pittsburgh as a vehicle to blame US President Donald Trump is a measure of psychosis that stretches Trump hatred to its limit. In “It’s an awful day in Mr. Rogers’s neighborhood” (October 28), the writer blames Trump for “milking the growing divide in the country” and says that he “continues to act in a way that widens the gulf.” Why doesn’t he mention that not a single voice arose from the Democratic Party in condemnation of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan ...

In these youth villages - youngsters are ‘adopted’ into families which include at least one child who is close to the same age as the adoptee. Youth villages have been part of the country’s landscape since the 1930s when they were welcomed adolescents fleeing Nazism. In the 1940s and 1950s, they housed Holocaust survivors who were the sole survivors of their families. By the 1960s, the kibbutz-style boarding schools began accepting youth at risk – youngsters from broken homes and disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. In these youth villages – established by WIZO, the Jewish Agency and N... Debra Messing, Mayim Bialik, Barbra Streisand, Ben Platt, Jason Alexander and more shared horror at fatal synagogue shooting. Israeli actress Gal Gadot and a wide range of other Jewish and Israeli celebrities expressed sadness and anger at the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday that took 11 lives. “All of humanity is connected to the same tree of life,” Gadot posted on social media on Sunday, referencing the name of the synagogue, Tree of Life. “My heart is broken and goes out to the families in Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence has rejected suggestions that the inflammatory rhetoric from President Donald Trump and others in the Republican Party has contributed to the rise of political violence, arguing that members of both parties engage in heated debate.

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is grieving with Pittsburgh’s Jewish community following the massacre at a synagogue there, denouncing the “inhuman act of violence” and praying for an end to the “flames of hatred” that fueled it. Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square, a day after a gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews opened fire in the synagogue during Sabbath services, killing 11 people. Francis prayed for the dead, the injured and their families. He says “all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence.” He prayed for God “to help us to extinguish the fl... This is what they had long been fearing. As the threats increased, as the online abuse grew increasingly vicious, as the defacing of synagogues and community centers with swastikas became more commonplace, the possibility of a violent attack loomed over America’s Jewish communities. On Saturday, the worst of those fears was made real as a gunman stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing at least 11 of its members and injuring many more, reportedly shouting “All Jews must die” during his rampage. It is the worst single attack on American Jews in the history of the country. And it is one that m... An unmanned lobster boat crashed into the bridge over The Gut in South Bristol on Saturday afternoon during heavy wind and rain, causing extensive damage to the boat and temporarily closing the drawbridge to boat traffic.

On Friday, he was identified by authorities as the Florida man who put pipe bombs in small manila envelopes, affixed six stamps and sent them to some of Trump’s most prominent critics. His arrest capped a week in which the bombs aimed at some of America’s biggest names — Obama, Clinton, De Niro — dominated the news and invited speculation about who might be responsible for them.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By Kevin Roose Early Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers’s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online. But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Mr. Bowers wrote. “Screw your optics, I’m going in.” The shooting in Pittsburgh came on the heels of another violent episode involving social media extremism. Cesar Sayoc Jr., the suspect in the pipe bomb mailing campaign, had a history of posting hateful and violent messages on Facebook and Twitter that were laced with misinformation and conspiracy theories. There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert — or “red pill,” in the parlance of right-wing internet activists — a new generation to their cause. [Related coverage: What we know about the Pittsburgh suspect, Robert Bowers. The victims of the shooting are identified. The latest developments in the Pittsburgh massacre. ] Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business. “The challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,” said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. “If an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren’t going to think it’s a good place for their baby photos.” Facebook and Twitter’s attempts to crack down on hateful and violent speech have been inconsistent, and many objectionable posts still slip through the cracks. (Mr. Sayoc, for instance, was reported to Twitter for making a violent threat against a Democratic television commentator this month, but the company declined to take action against him, a decision it has since said was in error.) But the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms — and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab. Mr. Bowers’s affiliation with Gab has already cost the company dearly. On Saturday, the company’s web hosting provider, Joyent, said it would stop hosting the site on Monday, according to an email posted by Gab on Twitter. The payment processing platform Stripe, which Gab has used to receive fees for its paid Gab Pro membership level, and which froze Gab’s account this month for violating its terms of service, said it was suspending transfers to the company’s bank account pending an investigation, according to another email posted to Twitter by Gab. PayPal, another payment processor, canceled Gab’s account, saying it had been closely monitoring the site even before Saturday’s massacre. “When a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,” a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons. Gab’s website was still online on Sunday, and the site claimed to have found a new hosting provider, though it did not identify the provider. Gab, which was started in 2016 by a conservative programmer, Andrew Torba, who was fed up with what he saw as Silicon Valley’s left-wing censorship, was a controversial project from the start. The announcement of its introduction doubled as a broadside against political correctness, which the company said had “become a cancer on discourse and culture.” Gab, its creator said, would be a social network where all speech would be welcome, no matter how noxious or offensive. In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab’s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers’s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation. “Because he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,” Mr. Torba wrote. “They would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.” Technically, there was nothing special about Gab at the start — its interface was buggy and unattractive, and it lacked the features of more established social networks. But the platform’s intentionally slim rule book attracted a crowd of extremists, including white nationalists and neo-Nazis, who had been banned from other social platforms. Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart writer whose harassment campaigns got him kicked off Twitter, signed up for an account. So did Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi publication Daily Stormer, and Richard Spencer, the well-known white nationalist. Within months, Gab had become a last refuge for internet scoundrels — a place where those with views considered too toxic for the mainstream could congregate and converse freely. The site’s guidelines prohibit threats of violence, but not hateful speech. Gab’s reputation for accommodating extremism may have been what drew Mr. Bowers to the site. In January, he signed up for an account, and began sharing anti-Jewish images, conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world, and criticism of President Trump — whom, he implied, was too accommodating of Jewish influence. He appeared to have other social media accounts, but Gab was where he aired his hatred in full. His bio on the site read, “Jews are the children of Satan,” and a photo on his profile included the number 1488, a reference to Nazism that is popular among white supremacists. After Mr. Bowers was named as a suspect in the mass shooting, Gab released a statement saying it “unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” The company spent much of Saturday replying to its critics on Twitter, and deflecting blame by pointing out that Mr. Bowers also had accounts on other social networks. The company boasted that its website was getting a million views per hour in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh shooting. This is not Gab’s first run-in with controversy. Last year, Google banned the company’s app for failing to moderate hateful content. (The app was rejected by Apple.) In August, Microsoft threatened to cut off Gab’s access to its Azure cloud service after posts surfaced on the site advocating genocidal violence against Jews. The posts were ultimately taken down. Mr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab’s core mission of promoting free speech. “Twitter and other platforms police ‘hate speech’ as long as it isn’t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,” he wrote. “This double standard does not exist on Gab.” What did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers’s hatred for Jews. The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab’s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology. “Gab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,” said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. “Gab’s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.” In the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate. Discord, a chat app built for video gamers, became a haven of white nationalists last year, who used the service to plan and execute the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. The company subsequently shut down several large far-right groups, but many have since reappeared. On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers’s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement’s long-term prospects by resorting to violence. “This guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,” one member wrote. A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting. On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab’s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because “Gab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.” Asked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer. “Absolutely not.”     Advertisement

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Eleven people gathered for a baby naming service were shot to death and four police officers wounded after a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life synagogue; Garrett Tenney reports from Pittsburgh. The alleged gunman in Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue spewed anti-Semitic posts on a social media platform where he claimed that Jews were "the enemy of white people," according to a report. Two hours before Robert Bowers, 46, allegedly burst into the Tree of Life Synagogue and opened fire during a Shabbat service, he posted on the chat site Gab.com about the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the New York Times reported. This image shows a portion of an archived webpage from the social media website Gab posting by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. (Associated Press) “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” a message attributed to Bowers said. HIAS, a Maryland-based nonprofit, helps refugees around the world and is guided by Jewish values, according to the organization. In total, Bowers allegedly killed 11 people and wounded at least six, including four police officers. He was also wounded and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. A criminal complaint said the 11 dead were eight men and three women, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Authorities did not immediately identify them. Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of HIAS, told the Associated Press he wasn’t aware of Bowers "until this morning," meaning after the shooting. A U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania filed 29 federal charges against Bowers Saturday night, the Post-Gazette reported. The suspect also faces local charges, the report said. The federal charges include 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING LEAVES 11 DEAD AND 6 WOUNDED; SUSPECT HIT WITH MULTIPLE CHARGES “The actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity,” said Scott W. Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.” Gab.com promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to sites like Twitter, which some critics say monitors content too rigidly. Just recently, President Trump complained that Twitter had purged some of his followers. Since the Bowers account launched on Gab in January, there have been frequent posts on the account about Jews, including conspiracy theories, according to reports by the New York Times and Associated Press. One post read: “Open your eyes! It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!” Another featured a photo of a Nazi concentration camp used to cremate Jews. A caption read “Make Ovens 1488F Again.” The first two words refer to the white supremacist “14 Words” slogan and “88” stands for “Heil Hitler” because “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Other posts featured conspiracy theories about the Holocaust, in which six million Jews perished during World War II. Other Bowers posts criticized President Trump, according to the reports. In one post, he called the president a “globalist, not a nationalist. There is no #MAGA as long as there is a [slur for Jews] infestation.” A month ago, he posted photos of three handguns he called his “glock family,” Reuters reported. Gab.com said in a statement that it suspended Bowers' account after his name was mentioned on police radio chatter about the Pittsburgh shooting. It then backed up the content on the account and alerted the FBI, the company said. “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,” a statement read. Gab's founder and CEO posted that PayPal has banned the site from using its online payment service. "The company is diligent in performing reviews and taking account actions. When a site is explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action," PayPal spokesman Justin Higgs said. Media tents and vehicles line an intersection near the Tree of Life Synagogue, upper left, where a shooter opened fire Saturday. Police said Bowers had 21 guns registered in his name and was not known to law enforcement before the shooting. He is a registered voter with “no affiliation” in Allegheny County, Pa. “For the record, I did not vote for him nor have I owned, worn or even touched a MAGA hat,” he once posted on social media, referring to President Trump. The shooting follows a pattern of massacres in places of worship and comes days after mail bombs were sent to prominent Democrats. Florida resident Cesar Sayoc Jr. has been charged in connection with the explosive devices. After the shooting, dozens of law enforcement officers descended on Bowers' neighborhood, which is about a 25-minute drive from the synagogue. One man who said he lived in the area for more than 15 years shook his head, noting that many immigrant families had recently moved in. Another woman told the Times she had struggled to understand violent hate. “I can’t believe it has spread out this far,” she said.

Brady, NBC News reports. The fatal shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning that killed 11 people and injured several others, including two officers and two SWAT team members, is being investigated as a hate crime, law enforcement officials said during a joint press conference Saturday afternoon. “This is the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen in my 22 years of law enforcement,” said Bob Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI in Pittsburgh. The victims were “brutally murdered” simply “because of their faith,” he added. Also Read: Anti-Defamation League Calls Pittsburgh Shooting 'Deadliest Attack' on Jewish Community in U.S. History Pittsburgh public safety director Wendell Hissrich said Bowers was hospitalized and in “fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds.” The suspect was armed with an AR-15 style rifle and “at least three handguns,” according to NBC News. The gunman started shooting inside a third-floor classroom, where the congregation usually holds a morning class, although it had been cancelled on Saturday, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The attack, taking place on the Jewish sabbath, happened as three concurrent services were being held at the synagogue, according to the PPG. Also Read: Robert Bowers: What We Know About Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting Suspect A verified account in Bowers’ name on the social media site Gab included several anti-Semitic posts. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” the account posted on Saturday morning. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” According to CBS 2 in Pittsburgh, Bowers shouted “all Jews must die” as he entered the building and started firing. “It sounded like a loud crash in the hallway,” Stephen Weiss, one of the synagogue attendees, told the PP-G. He heard loud gunfire and ran to the basement for cover. “Anti-semitism has no place in our commonwealth,” Governor Tom Wolf said. “I want the Jewish community across the commonwealth, and across the country, to know we stand with you.” Approximately 100 people, spread across the three services, would’ve been inside the synagogue at the time of the shooting, Michael Eisenberg, the congregation’s past president, told CNN. “This was an anti-Semitic act,” President Trump said in a speech on Saturday afternoon. “You wouldn’t think this would be possible.”  As you know, earlier today there was a horrific shooting targeting and killing Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The probe by the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, Cliffside Park police and U.S. Postal Inspection Service revealed that William Perez, 31, of 10th Street in Secaucus, and Aldo Perez, 29, of Palisade Avenue in Cliffside Park, were allegedly receiving drugs in the mail, Calo said. On Wednesday, Aldo Perez was arrested at the Cliffside Park Post Office after rece... PITTSBURGH — The suspect in the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue told officers that Jews were committing genocide and that he wanted them all to die, according to a charging document made public early Sunday. Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, police said in the affidavit, which contained some previously unreported details on the shooting and the police response.

Is wealth a stand-in for power, or is it a measurement of freedom? The relationship between money and morality is complicated. Wealth is easy to define; there's a dollar value. Thousands, millions, billions. Morality is less easily determined but is still a common metric for personal, internal worth. Which matters more to you, wealth or ethics?

Recently, in a CNN interview, Hillary Clinton said that "You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about." Apparently, she was talking about the Republicans, but what she seemed to be describing — whether she realized it or not — was the left-wing fringe of her own Democratic Party. The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh hearings were a prime example of angry, screaming protesters disrupting what should have been an orderly process. U.S. Rep.

Republicans and Democrats are unable to have civil conversations together. Could the present toxic state of affairs have anything to do with President Donald Trump, a serial liar and sexist bully who publicly mocks women and the disabled, and makes racist remarks? Trump's cabinet is a disaster. He promised to "drain the swamp."

Police have identified the suspect as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh. A man with the same name posted on the site Gab.com on the morning of the shooting that "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.

Sherrod Brown, a Cleveland Democrat, to a third term in the U.S. Senate. Two remaining questions: How big a lead will Brown pile up against his challenger, U.S. Rep.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By Kevin Roose Early Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers’s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online. But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Mr. Bowers wrote. “Screw your optics, I’m going in.” The shooting in Pittsburgh came on the heels of another violent episode involving social media extremism. Cesar Sayoc Jr., the suspect in the pipe bomb mailing campaign, had a history of posting hateful and violent messages on Facebook and Twitter that were laced with misinformation and conspiracy theories. There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert — or “red pill,” in the parlance of right-wing internet activists — a new generation to their cause. [Related coverage: What we know about the Pittsburgh suspect, Robert Bowers. The victims of the shooting are identified. The latest developments in the Pittsburgh massacre. ] Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business. “The challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,” said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. “If an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren’t going to think it’s a good place for their baby photos.” Facebook and Twitter’s attempts to crack down on hateful and violent speech have been inconsistent, and many objectionable posts still slip through the cracks. (Mr. Sayoc, for instance, was reported to Twitter for making a violent threat against a Democratic television commentator this month, but the company declined to take action against him, a decision it has since said was in error.) But the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms — and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab. Mr. Bowers’s affiliation with Gab has already cost the company dearly. On Saturday, the company’s web hosting provider, Joyent, said it would stop hosting the site on Monday, according to an email posted by Gab on Twitter. The payment processing platform Stripe, which Gab has used to receive fees for its paid Gab Pro membership level, and which froze Gab’s account this month for violating its terms of service, said it was suspending transfers to the company’s bank account pending an investigation, according to another email posted to Twitter by Gab. PayPal, another payment processor, canceled Gab’s account, saying it had been closely monitoring the site even before Saturday’s massacre. “When a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,” a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons. Gab’s website was still online on Sunday, and the site claimed to have found a new hosting provider, though it did not identify the provider. Gab, which was started in 2016 by a conservative programmer, Andrew Torba, who was fed up with what he saw as Silicon Valley’s left-wing censorship, was a controversial project from the start. The announcement of its introduction doubled as a broadside against political correctness, which the company said had “become a cancer on discourse and culture.” Gab, its creator said, would be a social network where all speech would be welcome, no matter how noxious or offensive. In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab’s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers’s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation. “Because he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,” Mr. Torba wrote. “They would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.” Technically, there was nothing special about Gab at the start — its interface was buggy and unattractive, and it lacked the features of more established social networks. But the platform’s intentionally slim rule book attracted a crowd of extremists, including white nationalists and neo-Nazis, who had been banned from other social platforms. Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart writer whose harassment campaigns got him kicked off Twitter, signed up for an account. So did Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi publication Daily Stormer, and Richard Spencer, the well-known white nationalist. Within months, Gab had become a last refuge for internet scoundrels — a place where those with views considered too toxic for the mainstream could congregate and converse freely. The site’s guidelines prohibit threats of violence, but not hateful speech. Gab’s reputation for accommodating extremism may have been what drew Mr. Bowers to the site. In January, he signed up for an account, and began sharing anti-Jewish images, conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world, and criticism of President Trump — whom, he implied, was too accommodating of Jewish influence. He appeared to have other social media accounts, but Gab was where he aired his hatred in full. His bio on the site read, “Jews are the children of Satan,” and a photo on his profile included the number 1488, a reference to Nazism that is popular among white supremacists. After Mr. Bowers was named as a suspect in the mass shooting, Gab released a statement saying it “unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” The company spent much of Saturday replying to its critics on Twitter, and deflecting blame by pointing out that Mr. Bowers also had accounts on other social networks. The company boasted that its website was getting a million views per hour in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh shooting. This is not Gab’s first run-in with controversy. Last year, Google banned the company’s app for failing to moderate hateful content. (The app was rejected by Apple.) In August, Microsoft threatened to cut off Gab’s access to its Azure cloud service after posts surfaced on the site advocating genocidal violence against Jews. The posts were ultimately taken down. Mr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab’s core mission of promoting free speech. “Twitter and other platforms police ‘hate speech’ as long as it isn’t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,” he wrote. “This double standard does not exist on Gab.” What did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers’s hatred for Jews. The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab’s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology. “Gab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,” said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. “Gab’s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.” In the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate. Discord, a chat app built for video gamers, became a haven of white nationalists last year, who used the service to plan and execute the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. The company subsequently shut down several large far-right groups, but many have since reappeared. On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers’s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement’s long-term prospects by resorting to violence. “This guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,” one member wrote. A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting. On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab’s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because “Gab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.” Asked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer. “Absolutely not.”     Advertisement
---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/elections-synagogue-shooting-bombs.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By Elizabeth Dias In South Florida, not far from the mass shooting in Parkland in February, voters absorbed a week of gun violence and pipe bombs with a kind of grim resignation. “Again?” asked Karenn Durand, 27, mid-shift at a restaurant in North Miami on Saturday, pondering the mass murder at a Pittsburgh synagogue. She said she held President Trump personally responsible — if not for the shooting itself, than at least for the nation’s deep divisions that the shooting reflected in horrific reality. In Milwaukee, Eric Pfeiler, an electrician who was walking downtown with his son on Saturday, saw more of a systemic breakdown than any one person to blame. “There’s just so much turmoil everywhere, it’s just sad,” Mr. Pfeiler said. “Everyone’s lost their vision and has just started pointing fingers.” And at President Trump’s rally on Saturday afternoon at an airport hangar in Murphysboro, Ill., people expressed anxieties over the violence and discord they saw in American society. But they had come for a Trump rally performance, and that was what they wanted to see. When he begged their forgiveness and asked them at one point, “If you don’t mind, I’m going to tone it down — just a little,” many people roared a resounding “No!” With nine days left in an already divisive election season, the campaign’s finale is unfolding amid a cascade of horrors and rounds of finger-pointing that reflect the deep fault lines in dozens of competitive House races and a handful of Senate races nationwide. If many voters appear set to back politicians from their own parties, according to interviews and polling, they also often defended or blamed politicians — particularly President Trump — based on the same partisan lines. On Friday, Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, was charged with sending explosive devices to at least a dozen of President Trump’s political foes. On Saturday, Robert Bowers was arrested and charged with 29 criminal counts in connection with an assault on a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead. Near Louisville, Ky., in an episode almost immediately forgotten, Gregory Bush, 51, was charged with murder after fatally shooting two black shoppers at a Kroger store on Wednesday after first trying to get inside a black church. Mr. Bush is white and the case is being investigated as a possible hate crime. In Florida on Saturday, hours after the synagogue shooting, Eric Gooden, a Democratic voter, hoped for an electoral solution to the turmoil. “The only way this will end is by the voting box,” he said. At Mr. Trump’s rally in Illinois, many people seemed altogether unaware of the synagogue shooting, until someone offered a prayer from the stage. Asked who was to blame for the country’s strife, Patricia Mitchell, who drove more than two hours from St. Louis to attend, cited “the globalists,” which she then defined as “somebody who won’t allow or doesn’t like for our country to just be themselves.” “They want to mold everybody into one big melting pot,” she said. “That’s not how we’re designed.” But the violence shows that the turmoil is starting very much at home. Many voters, in interviews with The New York Times in recent weeks, have been divided over national identity and who gets to define values in America, especially on issues of immigration and race. Mark Hetfield, who leads HIAS, a global Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees and that appears to have angered the synagogue shooting suspect, said his organization was in a state of shock. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime,” he said in a phone interview. “People have to stop saying hateful things about refugees, about Jews, about Latinos, about transgender people, about the other,” he continued. “It has to stop in the context of everything that we are doing, not just in the context of this election.” But in the final weeks of the midterm election, which has become in part a nationwide referendum on Mr. Trump’s leadership, the climate has intensified, and escalating violence and fear are exacerbating divergent viewpoints among voters. At the halfway mark of his term, Mr. Trump faces a reckoning at home related to some of the words he spoke from the inauguration dais: “This American carnage stops right here and right now.” “Pipe bombs against public officials, African Americans killed in Kentucky, continued physical threats against the press, an all-out campaign of fear directed at immigrants” signal that hate is on the march in America, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday. “We’re facing a battle for the soul of this nation,” added Mr. Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020. “Words matter. And silence is complicity.” For some, a parallel that comes to mind for the current moment is the summer of the presidential election of 1968, which saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy two months apart, said Randall Balmer, who chairs Dartmouth College’s religion department. “The difference, however, is that those shootings appeared to be directed against specific individuals, whereas this year’s violence is more tribal — against Democrats generally or Jews generally,” he said. Political leaders and candidates on the left and right saw a host of issues in Saturday’s tragedy, from gun violence to freedom to worship to the seemingly nonstop political maneuvering. “Why is it so hard to accept that a clearly deranged man carried out deranged acts?” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, tweeted. “The ‘false flag’ conspiracy theories on one side & the ‘it’s Trump’s fault’ on the other shows how unhinged politics has become. This isn’t incivility. It’s a society that has lost common sense.” In California, Katie Porter, a Democrat running for Congress in Orange County, denounced the commonplace nature of hate. “I’ve had enough of Washington politicians who are too afraid of crossing their donors in the gun lobby to take common-sense action to protect our families,” she said. As candidates in Pennsylvania canceled campaign events, and mourners gathered for vigils across Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump did not cancel his own rally in Illinois. He told the crowds the shooting was “an evil anti-Semitic attack,” and he urged the need to “vanquish the forces of hate.” But then he also criticized Hillary Clinton, a target in the pipe bomb mailings, prompting chants of “lock her up.” The crowd cheered when Mr. Trump said he would be sending troops to the border to stop the migrant caravan. In Florida, Edlyn LaFrance, 32, from Miami, said Mr. Trump was simply channeling the beliefs and grievances of his supporters, and that social media had only exacerbated an avalanche of national hate. “You just type one message on Facebook and hit ‘send,’” Ms. LaFrance said. “You find like-minded people.” The current climate of division is so pervasive that, in a report to be released this week, the Simon Wiesenthal Center found that more than 40 percent of Americans believe that the country is headed to a civil war, in a survey completed in September. “More than 80 percent of the voting public blames either the presidency, mainstream media or Congress, and it breaks down roughly along party lines,” said Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and dean of the center, who prayed at Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “Democrats and independents believe the executive branch is the problem. Republicans blame mainstream media and, to a lesser extent, congress.” Hey, I’m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. I’ll give you the latest reporting and intel on the midterms and take your questions from the campaign trail.  In Wisconsin, as news of the synagogue shooting broke Saturday morning, Ellie Thomas, a nutritionist, said she had been limiting her intake of news because the volume of tragedy has become overwhelming. The coming elections made her “anxious,” she said, because she felt it was Democrats’ only chance to bring “balance to the system.” Tanner Mayr, 19, simply voiced resignation. “If the collapse of our society happens, it happens,” he said. “Everything falls apart anyway.” Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting from Miami, Astead W. Herndon from Milwaukee, and Jeremy W. Peters from Murphysboro, Ill.    Advertisement
---split---9.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-responding-active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue/story?id=58790381---split---Eleven people were killed and at least six more were injured -- including four police officers -- when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, authorities said. "It's a very horrific crime scene," Alleghany Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters during the press conference Saturday afternoon. "It's one of the worst that I've seen." Police responded earlier Saturday to reports of active gunfire at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha congregation, where a service was taking place, Hissrich said. The suspect is in custody and has been taken to the hospital, Hissrich said. Eight men and three women were killed in the shooting, according to a criminal complaint. One of the four officers is in critical condition. The shooter has been identified as Robert Bowers, who is 46 years old and lives in Pittsburgh. Bowers use at least one assault rifle in the shooting and had three handguns on him. Bowers was charged with 29 federal counts late Saturday, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, Bob Jones, the agency's special agent in charge, said during a press conference Saturday afternoon. He is believed to have acted alone, Jones added.   He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in fair condition at a local hospital, Hissrich said. In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.   The congregants were attending a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue, Pennsylvania's state attorney general told the Associated Press. There were no children among the dead, Hissrich said. Jennifer Paddy said her daughter, who was staying at a friend's house near the synagogue, "heard rapid gunfire." "Her and her friend ... they ran downstairs and barricaded themselves in the basement," she told ABC affiliate WTAE in Pittsburgh. Since the incident happened at a synagogue, it is being treated as a federal hate crime and will be handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the assistance of local, county and state police, he added.   The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement. First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, and the injured have been taken to three area hospitals with level one trauma centers, Hissrich said. "Without their courage, this tragedy would have been far worse," said Hissrich said. Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who was not at the synagogue at the time, told ABC News he was "stunned" and "sorry" to hear of the shooting. He said he had stayed home from services Saturday morning because his wife was sick and that he has not heard from friends who were in the building.   Berkun, who lives nearby the synagogue, said police officers came to his door and told him to stay inside his home. He described the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, where the synagogue is located, as "a very Jewish neighborhood" which is "known as a Jewish community." "There's absolutely no crime, it's an amazing neighborhood," Berkun said. "It's hard to believe it's a city neighborhood. It's dominated by the Jewish community center four blocks away ... by kosher bakeries -- all kinds of Jewish gift shops, bookshops, a number of synagogues." "There is one major synagogue but there are at least five other synagogues within two miles of where we are," he said.   When the gunman opened fire at the synagogue, law enforcement officers, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) swiftly responded to the scene. The suspect was apprehended a short time later. The synagogue is a conservative Jewish congregation, according to its website, and there was a morning Shabbat service scheduled from 9:45 a.m. to noon.   Berkun said there are "three different religious groups that are meeting in our building on Saturday morning with three distinct services," estimating that there could have been approximately 75 people in the building at the time. Hissrich declined during the press conference to say how many people were inside at the time.   By late Saturday afternoon, with the death toll at 11, President Donald Trump signaled that he will change the tone of his typical rally speeches, telling reporters that "tone is very important." He said he was enthusiastic about being on the campaign trail, but that Saturday's mass shooting had changed things. "Tonight, I will absolutely change my tone," he said. Earlier, speaking to reporters before boarding a flight to the event in Indiana, Trump called the attack "a shame," calling the suspect "a wacko" and a "maniac." He also said the suspect should "pay the ultimate price" and be subjected to the death penalty. When asked about whether the nation's gun laws should be changed, Trump said the synagogue should have had armed security there. "You want protection, and they didn’t have any protection, they had a maniac walk in," Trump said. "The results could have been much better." He said that before getting into office, he would think "what a shame, what a shame" when incidents like this one unfolded. "It’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this thing happen," Trump said. After he arrived Saturday afternoon, the president said the shooter appeared to be an "anti-Semitic crime." "That is something you wouldn't believe could still be going on," he added. After hinting earlier in the day that he might cancel Saturday night's rally out of respect for the dead and wounded in Pittsburgh, he told the crowd that he was inspired to attend the rally by the late New York Yankees' owner and friend George Steinbrenner -- and his resolve for the Yankees to play after the September 11th attacks in 2001. Trump also claimed that the US Stock Exchange remained open, though it was closed for six days after the attacks. Vice President Mike Pence offered his condolences on Twitter. "Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders,” he tweeted Saturday morning. "God bless them all."  Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all.  First lady Melania Trump said her "heart breaks" over the shooting, and that "the violence needs to stop."  My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted that he was headed to Pittsburgh.   "We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need," he wrote.  On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need.  By Saturday evening, residents of the Pittsburgh apartment building where Bowers lived who had been evacuated were allowed back into their apartments. One neighbor described the suspect to ABC News as a quiet loner who lived alone and didn't stick out as any sort of danger. The New York City Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department said that they are deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities as well. "The NYPD is deploying heavy weapons teams, including the officers from the Critical Response Command and the Strategic Response Team, to houses of worship across the City," the department said in a statement. "Additionally, sector cars in every command across New York City will be making additional visits to ensure the safety of all of our residents. Currently, there is no nexus to New York. But these steps are being taken until further information is learned about the events in Pittsburgh by the NYPD." Police in Washington, D.C., are also on alert. "We have reached out to Jewish community leaders and have directed officers to pay special attention to synagogues until further notice," a spokesperson for the D.C. police department said.

Two House Democrats subsequently alleged that Zinke used federal dollars to promote Saccone's candidacy; they called for an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which handles ethics cases.

Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.

In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election — and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Larry Nassar's sentence was handed down on Tuesday. It was Wednesday. Additionally, we previously said Nassar's statement to victims came after his sentence was announced. It came before the sentence. A previous version of this post referred to Helle Thorning-Schmidt as the former Dutch prime minister. In fact, she was the prime minister of Denmark. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly identified Charlie Dent as a senator. Dent is a representative. In this report we say that roughly 100 people are losing their DACA status per week. We should have said per day. A previous photo caption misspelled Rafael Mercedes' first name as Raphael.

A previous version of this post incorrectly referred to the band Ladysmith Black Mambazo as Ladyship Black Mambozo. A previous version of this Web story said Three Day Rule's database of singles came from partnerships with online dating sites. The company's singles database is separate from its online dating site partnerships. Previous audio and Web versions of this story suggested that Americans are no longer legally required to buy health insurance. That's incorrect. The individual mandate to buy health insurance that was part of the Affordable Care Act — requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face a financial penalty — is still in effect until 2019. Additionally, former President Barack Obama's first name was misspelled as Barak. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly referred to the movie In the Fade as Into the Fade. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Dylan O'Riordan was brought to the U.S. on a visitor's visa. He came under the visa waiver program.

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to five days to keep the government running. Van Hollen said they would support a stopgap measure of three to four days. Additionally, Mitch McConnell was incorrectly identified as the Senate minority leader. He is the majority leader. An earlier Web version of this story quoted Bob Bland as saying Nevada voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in 2016. Nevada is a longtime swing state that went to Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. A previous version of this story stated that Americans will burn 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel made from soybean oil this year. In fact, some of that biodiesel will be made from other oils, including corn oil, canola oil and recycled cooking oil. A previous Web introduction to this story incorrectly stated that Matthew Kluger was a professor at George Mason University. He is a professor at Northwestern University. An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the DACA program will end in March 2017. The correct date for the end of the program is March 2018, absent a new law codifying it or a further delay of its termination by the Trump administration. A previous version of this story misspelled James Toback's last name as Torbeck. In this story, we say that two members of Congress, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, have resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, Rep. Trent Franks also resigned, for a total of three. A previous version of this story described Straight, No Chaser as a Clint Eastwood film. Charlotte Zwerin directed the film. Eastwood produced it. A previous Web and audio version of this story said the sale of Fiona-related items generated about $3 million for the zoo. However, the $2 million to $3 million number refers to the estimated boost to the local economy from the Fiona-related sales and tourism. We say President Trump's cognitive test took 30 minutes to complete. In fact, the White House physician did not say how long the test lasted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment typically takes about 10 minutes. Saxophonist Lester Young did perform with Benny Goodman on the Carnegie Hall stage in 1938, but the saxophone solo during "One O'Clock Jump" that is heard in this story was played by Babe Russin. A previous version of this story said Russell M. Nelson has 116 grandchildren. In fact, Nelson has 116 great-grandchildren. Additionally, we also quoted Russell M. Nelson as saying, "Two days ago, my brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles laid hands upon my hands." In fact, Nelson said "laid hands upon my head." A previous version of this story incorrectly said Michael Bond died in 2016. He died in 2017. A previous headline incorrectly said that the Great Recession led to fewer deaths among the unemployed. In fact, the decline in mortality is not limited to the unemployed. An earlier version of this story misspelled Johnathon Shillings' first name as Johnathan. A previous photo caption in this story said Ben and Tara were married in 2014 and Ben was diagnosed two years later. They were actually married in 2015 and Ben was diagnosed in 2016. A previous version of this story was missing the 12:30 a.m. time stamp, when investigators noted that the privacy settings on Marilou Danley's Facebook account had been changed.

While he did graduate from Yale University, he, in fact, earned his law degree from the University of Virginia. A previous version of this story misspelled Sen. David Perdue's last name as Purdue. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Dr. Ronny Jackson will brief reporters on Oct. 16. In fact, he will do so on Jan. 16.

A previous version of this story misspelled Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's last name as Roselló. A previous version of this story misspelled the surname of Cornell researcher Alan Hedge as Hedges. A previous version of this story incorrectly gave Xavier Becerra's first name as Javier.

A previous version of this story incorrectly gave Cardinal Francis Spellman's first name as John. A previous title and caption incorrectly said that alcohol consumption rates are declining in the U.S. They are actually increasing. A previous version of this story misspelled Marai Larasi's last name as Marasi. In this story, we say that the Census Bureau's then-director left in May 2017.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said Hillary Clinton won Rep. Frank LoBiondo's district in 2016. In fact, Donald Trump carried it by 4 points.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said that the only field test of the 2020 census questions is set to begin in April in Rhode Island's Providence County. The Census Bureau has conducted previous tests of potential questions, and participants in Providence County can take part in the last scheduled field test beginning in March. A previous version of this story misspelled Timothy Piazza's last name as Piazzaz. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we say historian Danielle McGuire met Recy Taylor on President Barack Obama's Inauguration Day in 2008. The correct year is 2009. A previous version of this story referred to Dartmouth College as Dartmouth University. The audio of this story incorrectly states that Tonya Harding landed the first triple axel in Olympics competition history. In fact, Canada's Brian Orser was the first person to land the triple axel at the Olympics. A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of author Santino Hassell as Hassle. A previous version of this story misspelled Allen Ginsberg's last name as Ginsburg. An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to U. S. Customs and Border Patrol. The correct name of the agency is U.S. Customs and Border Protection. An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Daimler-Benz. The correct name of the company is Daimler. In a previous version of this story, a photo of the late astronaut Gene Cernan seen saluting the flag was misidentified as John Young. That photo has been replaced. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Steve Bannon had been the chairman of the Trump campaign. He was the CEO. A previous version of the Web story incorrectly stated that more than half of the nation's Latino population lives in Los Angeles. It should have said that in Los Angeles, about half of the population is Latino. A previous version of this story referred to Meghan Markle as a princess-to-be. In fact, she will not be known as Princess Meghan. It is more likely that the queen will make Prince Harry a duke and Markle will become a duchess. A previous version of this story said Iceland has had a law against pay discrimination since 1963; in fact, the law passed in 1961. A previous headline misstated the title of the film as In The Land Of The Pomegranates; the correct title has no second "the." Also, because of an error in the press materials, Hava Kohav Beller's first name was misspelled as Hova. A previous version of this story said the Dow rose 4,000 points over the last four months. It rose by that amount over the last 10 months. This post has been updated to include comments from Mark Memmott. A previous caption misidentified Interstate 16 as Interstate 26. The audio of this story describes Papa, Jake and Kevin as elementary school students. They're actually eighth-graders, but in Chicago, kindergarten through eighth grade is referred to as elementary school. A previous version of this story said Republican Joshua Cole was certified as the winner in District 28. In fact, Republican Robert Thomas was certified as the winner. Cole is a Democrat. A previous version of this story misspelled the name of music publisher Wixen as Wixin. An earlier Web version of this story credited some information to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. The information came from the American Veterinary Medical Association. During this conversation, we mistakenly say that The New York Times reported George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat about a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. In fact, the Times reported that Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had collected potentially damaging information about Democratic political candidate Hillary Clinton. An earlier transcript referred to Luxembourg for Finance as a government bank. In fact, it is the agency for the development of the Luxembourg financial center. A previous version of this story said that if Mitt Romney ran for Senate from Utah, it would be his first run for Congress. Romney ran for Senate in 1994, losing to Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy. Additionally, Orrin Hatch and Thad Cochran were incorrectly referred to as Senate pro tempore. The correct term is president pro tempore. The original story incorrectly stated that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida came in second place in the 2016 Utah GOP caucuses. It was Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published. A correction posted here on Feb. 22 has been removed because it mistakenly stated that President Reagan signed that commission into law. In fact, it was President Carter. An earlier version of this story identified Sarah Broderick as CEO/CFO of Vice. She is COO/CFO. In previous audio and a Web introduction for this page, we said President Trump named Jerusalem the capital of Israel. In fact, he didn't name it as the capital; he said the U.S. would recognize it as the capital. In this story, Nikki Haley is described incorrectly as the U.S. ambassador to the United States. In fact, she is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. A previous Web version of this story misstated the name of Oxford American's deputy editor. He is Maxwell George, not George Maxwell. On an earlier Web page, puzzle winner Nick England was mistakenly referred to as Nick English. A previous version of the recipe for Friendship Bread incorrectly called for 25 ounces of active yeast. The correct amount is 0.25 ounces — or 2 1/4 teaspoons. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Robert Bowers, 46, has been identified as the suspect in Saturday's "horrific" mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, according to a law enforcement official. Police have Bowers in custody after the rampage that has resulted in 11 fatalities and six injuries. USA TODAY A Department of Motor Vehicles ID picture of Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) The man accused in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning screamed anti-Semitic epithets, including "All Jews must die," as he fired at random, a law enforcement official told USA TODAY. Bowers, 46, was armed with one assault rifle and three handguns during his shooting spree inside the Tree of Life synagogue as innocents were worshipping, the FBI said. He walked into the synagogue shortly before 10 a.m. By the end of the 20-minute attack, 11 were dead and six left seriously injured, including several officers. Just before entering the building, a social media account appearing to belong to Bowers posted an anti-semitic message to the website Gab, a fringe social media website utilized in large part by white nationalists and members of the far-right. "I can't sit by an watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I'm going in," the post said. He was charged late Saturday on 29 criminal counts, including 11 federal hate-crime charges. Among the charges were also 11 counts of using a firearm to kill. Those charges alone carry a maximum penalty of death, though no decision has been made about the death penalty. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. The profile includes an array of anti-Semitic comments and conspiracy theories. The anti-Semitic rants on social media prompted authorities to designate the FBI as the lead agency to investigate the attack as a hate crime. In the post just before the shooting, the organization HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was mentioned. The post accused the agency of bringing "invaders in that kill our people." It's unclear who Bowers meant when saying "our people." On the page appearing to belong to Bowers, he wrote about a number of conspiracy theories and his stark opposition to immigration, especially the migrant caravan that has drawn ire from the Trump administration. Bowers, though, said he did not vote for Trump. He seemed to believe the president was too soft on those of the Jewish faith and wrote that Trump was surrounded by those individuals, preventing him from keeping true to his slogan: "Make America Great Again." Law enforcement officers secure the scene where multiple people were shot at the Tree of Life Congregation. (Photo: ALEXANDRA WIMLEY, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP) Gab, in a statement, said it was "saddened and disgusted" by the attack but defended its ability to protect free speech. The site backed up the shooter's profile then suspended the account. But profiles like Bowers' are common on Gab. Anti-Semitic comments, conspiracy theories and wild pro-Trump posts are the norm as the website doesn't keep as tight of rules compared to mainstream sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. "Gab’s mission is very simple: to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Social media often brings out the best and the worst of humanity," the statement said. "Criminals and criminal behavior exist on every social media platform." Map locates the Tree of Life Synagogue near Pittsburgh, Pa. where a shooting occurred. (Photo: Frank Pompa, USA TODAY) Linda Lohr, who used to live across the street from Bowers, said she was stunned when she saw the news. She said Bowers, who she knew as "Rob," was living with his grandfather and she'd frequently see him outside mowing the grass. "I would have never thought he was a hatemonger," she said. "You think you know what your neighbor is like, then you find out something like this." Lohr said it seemed to her that Bowers did not have a job. She said Bowers moved out of the home when his grandfather passed away some time ago, approximately five to seven years ago. "I would say hello as I was in my garden and we would talk about the flowers and all the weeds," Lohr said. "I'm stunned that it was someone who lived just across the street. I can't comprehend it." Another neighbor, Philip Dodge, said he lived next door to Bowers and his grandfather. "I honestly didn't know them that well," Dodge said. "Mr. Jenkins passed away a while ago." After his rampage, Bowers was confronted by a lone Pittsburgh officer as he attempted to leave the synagogue about 10 a.m., the FBI said. The confrontation and subsequent shootout forced Bowers to barricade himself inside the synagogue. He was taken into custody after being shot multiple times and is in fair condition at the hospital. Law enforcement officials at a news conference Saturday afternoon said Bowers was not known to authorities, making it hard to foresee the tragedy. Bob Jones, Pittsburgh bureau's FBI Special Agent in Charge, said it was the "most horrific" crime scene he'd seen in 22 years. He said the victims were "brutally murdered" and was done "simply because of their faith." Federal charges against Bowers are expected to be filed soon, possibly as early as Saturday evening. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the charges could lead to the death penalty. Victims have not been named, but Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting occurred at the synagogue during a baby-naming ceremony.

USA TODAY People gather for a interfaith candlelight vigil a few blocks away from the site of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue on October 27, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo: Jeff Swensen, Getty Images) PITTSBURGH – Hundreds of people filled the streets outside the Jewish Community Center in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday night at a candle-light vigil for victims of Saturday's synagogue shooting. Teary-eyed people embraced as others sang hymns. State Rep. Dan Frankel, who has served the Squirrel Hill district for more than 20 years, said he was not surprised by the large showing of solidarity at the evening vigil, which was organized by young members of the community. "Squirrel Hill is a diverse community that embraces tolerance with a passion," he said. The vigil followed a shooting that left 11 people dead and six injured Saturday morning at the conservative Jewish Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill. Police arrested Robert Bowers, 46, in the shooting. More: Squirrel Hill is a Jewish enclave and Mr. Rogers' neighborhood More: Mass shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue leaves 11 dead Frankel described the day's events as "unfathomable." "It was a horrific day. It was a day that you can't even begin to imagine," he said. But Frankel said he is hopeful his community will heal. "The Jewish community and Jews know how to deal with tragedy," he said. "We have a sense of resilience." Rabbi Amy Bardack was attending services at nearby Beth Shalom synagogue when she heard about the shooting. "Everybody was whispering," she said about the possibility of a nearby shooting as the synagogue was put on partial lockdown. "It's tragic. It's surreal," she added A crowd gathers at the intersection of Murray Ave. and Forbes Ave. in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh during a memorial vigil for the victims of the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue, Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) Bardack described Squirrel Hill as a vibrant, tight-knit community. "We're all on top of each other," she said. "We all know each other." Bardack and other faith leaders were at the Jewish Community Center throughout the day as a "headquarter" for the whole community to gather and mourn. Nearby stores donated food, she said. The center and a nearby school recently had active-shooter drills, she said. Anti-Semitic acts had taken place before, but not anything that caused physical harm to people, she added. "October 27th will forever be a line in the sand of before and after," Bardack said. Follow Ryan Miller on Twitter: @RyanW_Miller. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jacksonville-landing-shooting_us_5b82ea11e4b0cd327dfdd18d---split---A gunman opened fire during a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday, killing two people and himself. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office confirmed Sunday that three people were killed and 11 were injured during the esports event at the Jacksonville Landing shopping mall, which is located in the city’s downtown area. The shooting took place at the Chicago Pizza restaurant. Authorities are working with the FBI to confirm the suspect as David Katz, 24, from Baltimore, Maryland. There are no other “outstanding suspects at this time,” Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said. The sheriff told reporters the suspect used “at least one handgun” and had been competing in the event. Williams reported that nine of the injured sustained gunshot wounds and that two others were hurt while fleeing the scene. He cautioned those numbers could change, as some people may have transported themselves to area hospitals. American eSports organizations tweeted that the shooting occurred during the southern qualifier round of the “Madden 19” championship series, a football video game tournament. The unconfirmed suspect was a frequent competitor at Madden gaming events and sometimes went by the names “Ravenschamp” and “Bread.” At a “Madden 17” gaming event, an announcer described Katz as someone who “keeps to himself” and “is not here to make friends.” Jacksonville shooter David "Bread" Katz "He's not hear to make friends" pic.twitter.com/uksPmfvRaU Authorities did not release any information about a potential motive and could not say whether Katz knew any of the victims. “This is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved,” tweeted video game company EA Sports, which organized the tournament. A livestream of the tournament appeared to capture the shooting in real time. The video, hosted on livestreaming platform Twitch, appears to show players participating in the tournament before 12 gunshots are fired. WARNING: The video below contains graphic footage and audio.

Jacksonville Landing tweeted it was “fully cooperating” with law enforcement officials and ongoing investigations. The shopping mall is located roughly 300 miles north of Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February. Six patients had been transported to University of Florida Health Shands Hospital, a spokesman for the hospital told HuffPost. One patient was in serious condition and five others were in good condition, he said. “Three patients were shot once, three patients were shot more than once,” Marie Crandall, a doctor at the hospital, told WJXT-TV. “They are all alert. They are all speaking with investigators.” Three patients were transported to Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville and were in stable condition, a spokesman for the hospital told The New York Times. We are deeply saddened at the incident and pray for everyone involved.

He managed to escape and run down the street to a nearby gym. He’s currently cooperating with the authorities and we will be flying him out of Jacksonville as soon as we are given the green light from the officials on the ground.” Sujeil Lopez told the Times her 25-year-old son, Timothy Anselimo, was among those injured. Anselimo, who goes by Larry, was shot three times, according to his mother. Lopez posted a photo of her son in his hospital bed surrounded by friends, captioning the tweet, “God was with these guys today.” God was with these guys today pic.twitter.com/YrWlphteBT President Donald Trump has been briefed on the incident, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Trump held a rally at the Jacksonville Landing in October 2015, an early stop in his presidential campaign. Sen.

Robert Gregory Bowers, the suspect in the latest mass shooting in America, allegedly acted alone in the Saturday morning massacre at the Tree of Life temple, bursting into Shabbat services with guns blazing and killing three women and eight men, while injuring six others, including four police officers, officials said. During a news conference Sunday morning, the names of the dead were released. They ranged in age from 54 to 97, and included two brothers, a married couple and a family physician. All the victims were from the Pittsburgh area. Dr. Karl Williams, the Allegheny County medical examiner, read the names of the victims: Joyce Fienberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69. (MORE: 8 men, 3 women killed in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting mourned) Also killed were brothers Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54; and Bernice Simon, 84, and her husband, Sylvan Simon, 86. Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, remained in fair condition and under guard on Sunday in a Pittsburgh hospital. He is scheduled to make his first appearance in federal court at 1:30 p.m. on Monday. Investigators said that minutes before carrying out the carnage, Bowers is believed to have posted his intent to commit the massacre on the social media platform Gab, which is popular with white supremacists and the alt-right. "Screw the optics, I'm going in," reads a post believed to have been made by Bowers moments before the first gunshots were fired inside the temple. Bowers was charged late Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. "Each count is punishable by death," Scott Brady, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said at Sunday's news conference. Bob Jones, the special agent in charge of the FBI Pittsburgh office, said Bowers allegedly used three Glock 357 handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle in the massacre. "All the weapons he brought into the facility were used," Jones said. Brady added that during the course of the deadly assault, "Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people." Jones said Bowers roamed the sprawling temple in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood to kill victims. Three services were occurring simultaneously at the temple at the time of the rampage and Jones said bodies were found in three different locations of the synagogue. The first shots were fired about 9:45 a.m. and calls went out to emergency medical services at 9:54 a.m. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was officiating one of the services when the shooting broke out. He told ABC News on Sunday that for about 20 seconds he wasn't sure what was happening. Myers immediately called 911 as another rabbi huddled with congregants in a cloakroom. He said he was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher being the "eyes and ears" for the police as they rushed to the scene. He declined further comment, saying, "I have seven funerals to plan for tomorrow." Officers raced to the synagogue and encountered Bowers as he was exiting the building and a gun battle ensued, authorities said. Bowers retreated back into the temple and went to the third floor, according to the criminal complaint filed against him. (MORE: Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: What we know about alleged mass shooter Robert Bowers) "SWAT operators entered the third floor of the building. While searching for any remaining victims SWAT operators encountered Bowers, who opened fire on the officers," according to the complaint. During the gunfight, two officers were shot multiple times by Bowers. Two other officers were injured by flying glass or bullet fragments in the encounter, authorities said. During the exchange of gunfire, Bowers was shot several times and taken into custody, according to the complaint. As Bowers was being treated at the scene, he blurted out a statement to SWAT Officer David Blahut, saying, "He wanted all Jews to die and also that they (Jews) were committing genocide to his people," according to the criminal complaint. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, according to Jones. Investigators suspect he acted alone, Jones said. (MORE: Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting claims 11 lives; 4 officers among multiple wounded: Officials) In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. Some of the congregants were gathering for a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue which had not yet started when the massacre began to unfold. No children were among those injured, authorities said. Five victims remained hospitalized Sunday evening, including two in critical condition, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He said the two in critical condition were a 40-year-old SWAT team member and a 70-year old man who is the chaplain at UPMC-Presbyterian. Dr. Leonard Weiss, assistant EMS medical director for the city of Pittsburgh, lives next door to the synagogue and told ABC News on Sunday that the gunfire woke him up. "I started hearing yelling. Then I realized it was very close by," Weiss said. "My first thoughts were to get safe. But I knew that my role with the city and my role in my job is to find out what's going on and respond." He said he called the emergency dispatch center to find out where the staging area was, then alerted his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center of the alarming situation. "Then I dressed up. I got as much equipment as I could together, and put my boots on and I went outside," Weiss said. "I immediately was suspicious when I heard the gunfire that there would be several casualties. It took a long time for the scene to get safe and for us to get a specific count on who was injured." He said police officers escorted him to the staging area, where he helped direct ambulances to the scene and paramedics to the scene. He recalled checking on one victim with a bullet wound who was being rushed to the hospital in bad shape. He said that once the gunfire subsided and the wounded had been removed from the synagogue, he went to the threshold of the temple and looked in. "I saw several damaged windows. I could see a lot of upsetting things in the chapel that was beyond that threshold," he said. "I was able to visualize some of the victims who lost their lives. "I felt very emotional," he said. "I felt scared for myself and for my family and my neighbors. I felt scared for my city that it could happen here. And, [I] felt especially proud and worried about my colleague paramedics that risked their lives to go right in and pull people out while the action was unfolding." He said it wasn't until Sunday morning that he heard one of the victims killed was Rabinowitz, a family physician and colleague at the UPMC Shadyside Hospital. Kim and Ken Hardin, who live across the street from the synagogue, said they heard the shots and quickly ushered their children and a friend of theirs into the basement and away from windows. "We heard five repetitive shots. I stepped out on my porch and I heard three additional shots and within minutes police started to arrive," Ken Hardin told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Sunday. "Police started to park in front of our house. They were shielding themselves with their car. So we realized the situation was pretty serious." He said five officers knocked on his back door and asked to use their second floor to position snipers. "The five police officers went upstairs, asked that I open the windows in our bedroom and obtain a chest-high dresser," Ken Hardin said. "So I found one in my son's room. A police officer and I took the drawers out and dragged the dresser right in front of the window and they perched their rifles on top of the dresser toward the synagogue." Kim Hardin added: "We did see shooting taking place. Our youngest son said that he saw a police officer get shot. I don't know whether or not that he did. It was certainly traumatic for a 10-year-old to see police with so many weapons and to hear the gunfire." The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement. (MORE: After Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Trump decries 'wicked act of mass murder') First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, Brady said. "They are truly heroes, who without hesitation, without concern for their safety ran toward gunfire to protect innocent victims. By confronting and neutralizing Bowers, they prevented additional loss of life," Brady said. The shooting rattled nerves across the country and globe and prompted an outpouring of support and condolences. In New York, the Empire State Building went dark except for an orange halo on the mast to honor the victims. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower also went dark in homage to the victims. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the city of Pittsburgh will stand by the victims' families and help them get through the tragedy. "Pittsburgh is a strong town. We are a resilient city," Peduto said at Sunday's news conference. "We'll get through this darkest day in Pittsburgh's history by working together."

Barricading himself on an upper floor, Mr. Bowers engaged in a desperate shootout that left him and four police officers wounded.

Many of those who perished were advanced in years. Some, like Rose Ma... PITTSBURGH — Robert Bowers, the man accused of gunning down 11 congregants in a virulently anti-Semitic rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue, was an isolated, awkward man who lived alone and struggled with basic human interactions, neighbors and others who knew him said on Sunday. “He was in his own little world,” said Jim Brinsky, 46, a friend from childhood. Mr. Brinksy said he and Mr. Bowers, 46, grew up together but that he never met Mr. Bowers’s parents and got the impression that Mr. Bowers had a difficult home life. As teenagers, he said they built pipe bombs and blew up watermelons and... Early Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers’s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online. But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Mr. Bowers wrote. “...

RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil on Sunday became the latest country to drift toward the far right, electing a strident populist as president in the nation’s most radical political change since democracy was restored over 30 years ago. The new president, Jair Bolsonaro, has exalted the country’s military dictatorship, advocated torture and threatened to destroy, jail or drive into exile his political opponents. He won by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in Brazil — a country whiplashed by rising crime and two years of political and economic turmoil — and by presenting himself... Jair Bolsonaro’s climb to power has been marked by divisive rhetoric and offensive speech that has thrilled followers and appalled critics in equal measure. The far-right former army captain’s rise has left some baffled. Mr. Bolsonaro served seven consecutive terms in Congress, with little to show for his time there — very few of his bills were approved. But many Brazilians, angered by their country’s economic crisis, soaring violence and corruption scandals interpreted his long list of caustic remarks as blunt but bracingly honest talk from a man willing to say — and do — whatever was nece...

WASHINGTON — Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for President Trump’s planned re-election effort in 2020, has never run another political race of any kind. Republican establishment figures are watching him closely, in some cases quietly hoping he stumbles. And he is working for a famously mercurial boss whose 2016 campaign had three shake-ups over six months.

What is going on in this country? Can’t we be safe in our homes, in our schools, in our most sacred places? Once again, Americans are left to ask each other these sorts of questions, after a gunman burst into the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on the Jewish sabbath and opened fire on families in the contemplation of their faith. Armed with an automatic rifle and three handguns, he killed 11 people and wounded six more, including four police officers. “Jews must die,” he was said to have shouted. The attack came a day after a man was arrested in Florida for mailing pipe bombs to politi... Our national dialogue about diversity and inclusion, about acceptance and egalitarianism, is poisoned, and Donald Trump is holding a rather large pouch of poison. Last week, we saw the arrest of a Trump supporter who sent pipe bombs through the mail to people who were frequent rhetorical targets of the president, many of them prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. Then on Saturday came a mass shooting at a Jewish synagogue by a rabid anti-Semite.

President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit.

As Hurricane Florence headed toward the Eastern Seaboard in September, Ted Tremper, the showrunner for “This Week at the Comedy Cellar,” realized he had a problem, and it wasn’t damage from the storm. He needed jokes. It was the final day of shooting for the test show, and while he had hours of footage of comics weighing in on eight categories (Trump, #MeToo, Colin Kaepernick, etc.), he had no punch lines about Florence. As a former producer of “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” he knew humorous takes on the news needed to stay current. But there was another issue. Some forecasts were sugge... If you are a true New Yorker, you have probably spent a Sunday waiting in line at a restaurant that serves the same brunch dishes as the empty joint next door, while your earbuds play some sort of yacht rock music provided by your insurance company or mortgage holder, which has, of course, put you on hold. It’s how New Yorkers build up the reserves of hostile energy that keep the lights burning.

IBM is making a big move to bring more software developers under its wing by acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the popular open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion. The purchase, announced on Sunday afternoon, is the latest competitive step among large business-software companies seeking an edge in the fast-growing market for cloud computing. In June, Microsoft acquired GitHub, a major code-sharing platform for software developers, for $7.5 billion. With the deal for Red Hat, IBM is trying to position itself as a kind of corporate “Switzerland” in cloud computing — a ... Harlem residents were stunned and heartened Sunday by the news that someone among them may have woken up a multi-millionaire. One of two winning Powerball tickets was sold at a bodega in West Harlem. The as-yet-unidentified winner will split the jackpot of nearly $688 million with a lucky counterpart who bought the other winning ticket in Iowa, lottery officials said. The winners matched all six numbers — 8, 12, 13, 19, 27 and Powerball 4 — to claim the fourth-largest lottery prize in United States history. “Who was it?” asked Jose Espinosa from behind the counter at his father’s bodega, We... As Halloween gets closer, “Halloween” — the latest sequel in the fright franchise originated by John Carpenter — is creeping up the ranks and passing its predecessors. Universal’s slasher sequel was No. 1 at the box office for a second week and grossed an estimated $32 million this weekend, bringing its North American total to about $126.7 million. It has earned an estimated $172.3 million worldwide, according to the studio. The new movie, in which Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her role from four decades ago, has now overtaken both “Halloween: H20” (1998) and “Halloween II” (1981) to become t...

LOS ANGELES — Just four years after its founding in 2006, SolarCity had emerged as the nation’s leading rooftop solar power company. The company’s founders, with the help of their billionaire cousin, Elon Musk, set out to be the vanguard of an age in which consumers weaned themselves from dependence on utilities for their electricity. After piling on debt in pursuit of fast growth, the business was absorbed into Mr. Musk’s Tesla empire two years ago. And now rivals are chipping away at its primacy in installation and innovation. In the short term, the biggest competition is coming from Sunr... Transgender people are appearing more often in advertisements and mass media. But when they do, it’s very often in stock photos that show them standing against a blank wall, or else they are hardly seen at all. The most used stock photos are close-ups of their hands holding the symbol for transgender pride, without their faces or other defining features visible. Stock photographs — which appear in ads, brochures and magazines, and are supposed to seem familiar and inviting — are one measure of how a society sees itself. Transgender people exist, the photographs seem to say, but at a distanc... DUBLIN — For 30 years, she struggled with secret memories of beatings and other abuses, as well as most of the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder: chronic anxiety, social isolation, compulsive behavior, depression, flashbacks, nightmares and suicidal thoughts. Finally, 20 years ago, convinced the pain would never subside unless she acted, Elizabeth Coppin, now 69, walked into a police station in her native County Kerry, Ireland. She filed a complaint relating to the 12 years she had spent in an Irish “industrial school,” one of a now-defunct network of state-funded orphanage... ARUA, Uganda — President Trump is vowing to send the military to stop migrants trudging from Central America. Europe’s leaders are paying African nations to block migrants from crossing the Mediterranean — and detaining the ones who make it in filthy, overcrowded camps. But Solomon Osakan has a very different approach in this era of rising xenophobia. From his uncluttered desk in northwest Uganda, he manages one of the largest concentrations of refugees anywhere in the world: more than 400,000 people scattered across his rural district. He explained what he does with them: Refugees are allo...

All the holiday planning, coordinating, decorating and entertaining can sap some of the enjoyment out of a season that should be full of cheer.

When Glenn Rhee, the scrappy pizza deliveryman turned warrior on “The Walking Dead,” became another casualty of that AMC series, Steven Yeun, the actor who played him, already felt he had outgrown his character. But like Donnie Yen, Joan Chen and other Asian-American performers before him, he had to look outside Hollywood to find three-dimensional roles that defied stereotypes and caricatures. While “The Walking Dead” led to parts in provocative American indies like “Sorry to Bother You” and “Mayhem,” it’s in South Korea that he got a chance to collaborate with world-class auteurs on seriou... When Lincoln Kirstein and the choreographer George Balanchine were attempting to get a company off the ground in the 1930s and ’40s, they had little more than a pickup troupe, with meager seasons and slender prospects. That began to change in 1948, when the company, the newly named New York City Ballet, found an institution willing to take it in: New York City Center. The studios had splintery floors. The orchestra pit was cramped. There was practically no backstage space — and the stage itself was small. “I could do a couple of jumps and be past center stage,” said Jacques d’Amboise. He da...

Why do you look so good in those jeans? Forgive me for being forward, but it’s been nearly two weeks since the release of the soundtrack for “A Star Is Born,” which means it’s been nearly two weeks since I’ve been unable to get the impolite lyrics from “Why Did You Do That?” out of my head.

When I saw that your 90-year-old father was in our emergency department, after being resuscitated while on home hospice, I assumed that I understood what had happened. As a critical care doctor, I have cared for patients whose families have changed their minds at the last minute, grasping on to impossible hopes rather than face the reality of death. On the phone with the E.D. physician, I sighed. “Family?” I asked. “Must have reversed the D.N.R.” — the do-not-resuscitate order that is standard for a patient on hospice care. “They’re on the way,” she said.

Bolsonaro, a federal congressman for Rio de Janeiro who formerly served as an Army officer, has praised the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 and has expressed a fondness for authoritarians past and present. He defeated former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers’ Party to win the runoff phase of the election. With nearly all votes counted, Bolsonaro had captured mo... The pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine worshippers were gunned down in 2015, condemned President Donald Trump’s response to the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday. “Words do matter,” the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning told his congregants during an emotional sermon on Sunday. “The words that come out of your mouth can do much harm or much good. The choice is indeed yours.” Manning criticized Trump for claiming “armed guards” likely could have prevented a gunman’s attack on the Tree of Life Congregation, which left at least...

While speaking to the Future Farmers of America in Indianapolis Saturday, President Donald Trump praised the efforts of Dr. Norman Borlaug, a scientist who won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in developing a high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat. But the president couldn’t keep the focus on anyone else for too long, and naturally proceeded to put himself into the Nobel Prize conversation. “They probably will never give it to me, even what I’m doing in Korea and Idlib province and all of these places,” Trump said. “They probably will never give it to me. You know why? Because they d... President Donald Trump on Sunday, just days after calling for civility on “all sides” following mail bomb attacks on prominent Democrats, called billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer a “crazed & stumbling lunatic” on Twitter. Steyer was the intended recipient of one of at least 13 pipe bombs that were discovered last week. The packages were also addressed to CNN and other high-profile Democrats, including Hillary and Bill Clinton and former President Barack Obama.

Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kansas) is in a lot of political trouble. The rising likelihood that he’ll lose his bid for a fifth term probably explains why he has stooped to a remarkably disingenuous and laughable line of attack against his Democratic opponent, Sharice Davids, just days ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. Yoder, 42, was swept into Congress during the 2010 Tea Party wave fueled by anger at then-President Barack Obama, winning a previously Democratic seat by nearly 20 percentage points.

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) on Sunday dismissed President Donald Trump’s suggestion of adding “armed guards” to houses of worship in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue a day earlier. Peduto, during an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” instead urged Congress to pass stricter gun laws to prevent similar attacks in the future. “I don’t think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or our schools filled with armed guards,” Peduto said. “We should try to stop irrational behavior fr... A North Carolina woman has been dubbed “South Park Susan” after harassing two black sisters waiting for AAA outside an apartment complex in south Charlotte.

A month after announcing his departure from the Republican Party, Ohio billionaire and former GOP mega-donor Les Wexner has reportedly started giving money to Democrats.

In late August, I went to the Women’s Baseball World Cup, billed as “Baseball’s Biggest Event for Women.” It is essentially the World Series for the women, but they aren’t allowed to call it that — copyrights and such — and it’s not really the biggest, at least not this eighth iteration, which was the first world cup hosted in the United States.

A former editorial cartoonist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Sunday released a powerful illustration comparing the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation a day earlier to the infamous “Kristallnacht” in Nazi Germany. Rob Rogers, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, called his cartoon “Day of Broken Glass,” an apparent reference to “Kristallnacht,” which translates to “Night of Broken Glass.” On “Kristallnacht,” which took place Nov. 9-10, 1938, Germans burned down synagogues, vandalized Jewish homes and killed roughly 100 Jews. The deadly night was named after the shards of broken glass l... Saturday morning, President Donald Trump attacked a Democratic Senate candidate on Twitter, calling her a “Nancy Pelosi Wacko!” Just a short while later, speaking about the horrific shooting massacre in Pittsburgh that killed at least 11 people, Trump lamented, “It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country… It’s a violent world. You think when you’re over it, it just goes away but then it comes back in the form of a madman, a wacko.” Within a few hours, the president of the United States applied the term “wacko” to one of the most accomplished public servants in ...

The editorial board of a major Iowan newspaper has endorsed Rep. Steve King’s Democratic challenger for Congress, bucking its longtime support for one of the GOP’s mostly openly racist lawmakers. The Sioux City Journal’s editorial board on Friday announced its support for J.D.

Mere hours after a deadly mass shooting at a Pennsylvania synagogue, President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Saturday night to talk about baseball. The president, who’d apparently tuned in to watch Game 4 of the World Series, called out Los Angeles Dodgers’ manager Dave Roberts in his late night posting. The Dodgers lost the game to the Boston Red Sox, 9-6, after having a 4-0 led, and Trump questioned Roberts’ managerial moves. Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodger... I’ve been feeling autumnal recently (who hasn’t?), so I’ve been doing all the autumnal things: layering cable-knit pullovers and going for long walks, baking cinnamon scones, finally flipping my heating/cooling unit to “heating,” knitting blankets, ordering three sweaters from Madewell and then returning two of them, sipping hot apple cider with Fireball. A crackling fire would be an ideal backdrop to all of this, but I don’t have a working fireplace, so I turn to the next-best way to zhuzh up a home’s seasonal vibe. I flip to the Hallmark Channel.

After spending about four hours in line to get their entrance badges on Friday, they were shocked that getting through ... Sue Lee, 76, has plaque psoriasis, an incurable, chronic skin condition that causes itchy, painful sores. To give her some relief, Lee’s doctor prescribed Humira, a patent-protected drug with no generic option. In 2012, the drug cost about $19,000 a year. Today, it costs more than $38,000 a year. Even with Medicare, Lee, who retired last year and lives in Kentucky, would have to drain the little savings she has in order to afford the drug. Retirement should be the peaceful denouement of a lifetime of work. Instead, millions of seniors are being forced to draw down on their retirement saving... DOYLESTOWN, Pa. – Democrats are on the verge of winning back control of the House of Representatives because of suburbs like this one. The sheer number of competitive Republican-held seats in suburban areas, from Orange County, California, to Loudoun County, Virginia, makes it likely, although not certain, that Democrats will win the 23 seats they need to take control of the House in January 2019. So now the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other outside Democratic groups are increasingly investing in areas where President Donald Trump’s political standing is stronger. These ... Eric Trump conceded to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on Saturday that harsh political rhetoric “might” be linked to recent violence, including the shooting death of 11 people in an apparent anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier — or it “might not.” “Listen,” he noted, “America mourns, right?” Pirro quizzed President Donald Trump’s second son on both the synagogue shooting and the pipe bombs mailed earlier in the week to Democratic political figures and other targets of his father.

TOBIAS, Newark Advocate via USA TODAY Network) The Jewish congregants were there to celebrate life, but were met by death. Most never had a chance. Just before 10 a.m. Saturday, suspected gunman Robert Bowers, 46, burst into the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh and, yelling "All Jews must die," killed 11 before himself being wounded and taken into custody. The list of those killed Saturday included middle-aged brothers, an elderly husband and wife and a grandmother nearing 100. All were cherished members of a tight-knit Jewish community with deep roots in Pittsburgh history. Many of them had gathered for a naming ceremony, which marks the beginning of a baby's journey in the Jewish faith. Some arrived on this traditionally holy day, the sabbath, simply to worship, study and pray. All wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else.

"The families are in shock and grieving, please be respectful of their needs, their time and space as they deal with this tragedy," he said. Those killed were Daniel Stein, 71; Joyce Feinberg, 75; Richard Gottfried, 65; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; brothers Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal 54; husband and wife Bernice Simon, 84 and Sylvan Simon, 86; Melvin Wax, 88; and Irving Younger, 69. The Rosenthal brothers, Cecil and David, were long-time members of the Tree of Life synagogue, according to J.E. Reich, who grew up in the neighborhood the brothers called home. Reich said the brothers were developmentally disabled and lived together. The two had Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder that often results in mild to moderate intellectual disability. Cecil Rosenthal loved to greet people at the door of the synagogue before services “not out of obligation, but out of joy,” said Reich, a reporter who has written for online websites such as Jezebel. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Reich tweeted that due to the ongoing police investigation, which has involved cordoning off part of the cemetery at Tree of Life, all burials may be delayed. "This is heartbreaking: the map for the cemetery plots where the victims will be interred is still in Tree of Life Synagogue – still cordoned off as a crime scene – which might delay their burials," Reich wrote. "Synagogue admin is hoping that an FBI agent will be able to get the plot plan for them." Achieva, an area organization that helps the developmentally disabled, put out a statement Sunday that said both brothers had a deep love of community and life. “If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be,” said Chris Schopf, Achieva's vice president of residential supports. “Cecil’s laugh was infectious," Schopf added. "David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable. Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around.” Pittsburgh Steelers fans sit behind a banner with a Star of David beside their Steelers blanket as they watch the teams warm up before an NFL football game between the Steelers and the Cleveland Browns, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in Pittsburgh. There was a deadly shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday. (AP Photo/Don Wright) (Photo: The Associated Press) Sylvan Simon, 86, and his wife, Bernice, 84, lived in Wilkinsburg, about six miles from Tree of Life. One of their sons, Martin, died in a motorcycle accident in 2010. Bernice Simon was a retired nurse who served for several years on the board of their townhouse community, according to Simon Reichbaum, who lived three doors down from the couple for more than two decades. “They were very nice people, I could not think of a bad word to say about them,” said Reichbaum, who described Bernice Sylvan as his “comrade-in-arms” on the townhouse board. She “wanted to do right for others,” Reichbaum said. Reichman said Sylvan Simon, who was also retired, liked to take walks around the neighborhood. He always exchanged a wave and a friendly hello. In 2008, Sylvan Simon was quoted in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article about the popularity of the Nintendo Wii video game among senior citizens. The shooting “has struck us all very hard,” said Reichbaum, 74, whose children attended Hebrew school at Tree of Life when they were young. “I can’t even put it into words.” Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was a family doctor in Pittsburgh, where he shared a practice with Kenneth Ciesielka. Jerry and his wife Miri were devoted members of Dor Hadash, which is housed at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and he had served as past president of the Jewish reconstructionist congregation, friends said. As a kid, Rabinowitz attended Maple Avenue School in Newark, New Jersey, from grade school through middle school. Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, a family doctor in Pittsburgh, is pictured in summer 2017. He was killed Oct. 27, 2018, in a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. (Photo: Handout) Mark Sarver, who met Rabinowitz in grade school and later served as the best man in his wedding, said his best friend “never took my friendship for granted.” As a boy, "Jerry was a small version of the adult self that he became," said Sarver of Washington, D.C. "He was studious but brilliant. He was earnest but fun loving. He just had this basic goodness about him.” Rabinowitz earned bachelor’s and medical degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in the 1970s and moved to Pittsburgh around 1980. Known for his signature bowtie and delightful bedside manner, Rabinowitz earned a reputation for faithfully tending to the needs of his patients, friends and family. “He was extremely caring (and) would always put everyone else’s needs before his own,” said Avishai Ostrin, his nephew, who spoke with USA TODAY from his home in Israel. “It was always about everyone else.” More: What is Gab, the fringe social network used by Pittsburgh shooting suspect? More: Design based on Steelers helmet honors synagogue dead Ostrin said his uncle was "just really, really funny, outgoing (with a) great, loud laugh. Always a smile on his face, always lending a hand.” Years ago, when Sarver’s mother had surgery in Pittsburgh, Rabinowitz made special arrangements to make sure his family was cared for. “We both knew that we were friends to the end, no matter what,” Sarver said. “We could talk about anything and everything.” Richard Gottfried, 65, not only was a longtime dentist, but was an avid golfer, runner and book lover.

He practiced dentistry with his wife of 38 years, Margaret Duranchko. On Sunday, their practice’s answering machine said: "Our office is closed indefinitely due to the tragic death of our beloved Dr. Rich." Though he was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue, he and his wife volunteered their skills as dentists for the Catholic Charities Free Dental Clinic. Also as a couple, they were wedding counselors at St. Athanasius Catholic Church in the suburb of West View, where Duranchko is a parishioner. Their practice is also in West View. Gottfried had an undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh and received his dental degree there as well in 1980, the same year he married Durachko. Melvin Wax, 88, was a kind, simple man with a well-known presence in the synagogue, said Bill Cartiff, 56, who has been friends with Wax’s daughter for 30 years. The retired accountant went to the Tree of Life Synagogue three to four times a week and lived in Squirrel Hill. Melvin Wax, right, shown here in a photo provided by a family friend, died in the massacre at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue. He was 88. (Photo: Courtesy of Bill Cartiff) Although hard of hearing, Wax was in good health, ate well and didn’t even need a walker, said Cartiff. He also told jokes, was “with it” mentally and could hold good conversations. His daughter Jodi Kart, whom Cartiff is neighbors with in the South Hills, saw her father several times a week. One grandchild also survives Wax, whose wife died two years ago. Wax’s family will meet with the Jewish funeral home Monday, and the funeral will probably take place Tuesday or Wednesday, Cartiff said. “Yesterday was a day of waiting and stressful anticipation of what was happening and getting the official news, which we didn’t get until late in the day after dark,” Cartiff, 56, told USA TODAY. “Today is just a day to let the dust settle, meet with some family and make arrangements. Because the funeral home couldn’t meet with us until tomorrow, we’re kind of in limbo.” All of those who died leave behind grieving family and friends. Daniel Stein, 71, was a member of the New Light Congregation, a conservative Jewish congregation that was one of three who shared space at the synagogue. A new grandfather, he attended services every Saturday and was an active supporter of the community, according to TribLive. Joyce Feinberg, 75, was the wife of the late Stephen E. Feinberg, a professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University, who died in 2016. They had two sons, Anthony Feinberg of Paris, and Howard Feinberg of Vienna, Virginia, and several grandchildren, according to her husband’s obituary. Irving Younger, 69, and his wife Sherry, who died in 2007, had two children, Jordanna and Jared, according to her obituary, which ran in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Some reacted strongly on Twitter to the ages of the deceased. "Way to rid the world of the scourge of people’s grandparents and great grandparents, you monster," wrote musician E Marlowe, including a link to the list of those killed. In addition to the 11 dead, six people were injured.

(Photo: Frank Pompa, USA TODAY) Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto described Saturday's shooting as the “darkest day in Pittsburgh’s history.” Jeff Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said Sunday that "it's real once you hear the names. (But) we’ll be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region heal from this.” The U.S. attorney's office Saturday filed 29 charges against Bowers, whose online presence, while previously unknown to authorities, displayed extreme prejudice against those of the Jewish faith. The charges include 11 counts of obstructing the exercising of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence; four counts of obstructing the exercising of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of using and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. Bowers remains hospitalized in stable condition with several gunshot wounds, officials said Sunday. In July, Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers wrote a blog post for his congregation lamenting the escalation of gun violence across the country.

(Photo: Jeffrey Becker, USA TODAY Sports) "Despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that it would fade away in time," Myers wrote in a post titled "We Deserve Better," which also referenced the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. "Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the mid-term elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume," Myers wrote. "I shouldn't have to include in my daily morning prayers that God should watch over my wife and daughter, both teachers, and keep them safe. Where are our leaders?"

---split---10.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/multiple-casualties-police-respond-active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-151503711--abc-news-topstories.html---split---Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting claims 11 lives; 4 officers among multiple wounded: Officials originally appeared on abcnews.go.com Eleven people were killed and at least six more were injured -- including four police officers -- when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, authorities said. "It's a very horrific crime scene," Alleghany Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters during the press conference Saturday afternoon. "It's one of the worst that I've seen." Police responded earlier Saturday to reports of active gunfire at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha congregation, where a service was taking place, Hissrich said. The suspect is in custody and has been taken to the hospital, Hissrich said. Eight men and three women were killed in the shooting, according to a criminal complaint. One of the four officers is in critical condition. The shooter has been identified as Robert Bowers, who is 46 years old and lives in Pittsburgh. Bowers use at least one assault rifle in the shooting and had three handguns on him. Bowers was charged with 29 federal counts late Saturday, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, Bob Jones, the agency's special agent in charge, said during a press conference Saturday afternoon. He is believed to have acted alone, Jones added. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in fair condition at a local hospital, Hissrich said. In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The congregants were attending a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue, Pennsylvania's state attorney general told the Associated Press. There were no children among the dead, Hissrich said. Jennifer Paddy said her daughter, who was staying at a friend's house near the synagogue, "heard rapid gunfire." "Her and her friend ... they ran downstairs and barricaded themselves in the basement," she told ABC affiliate WTAE in Pittsburgh. Since the incident happened at a synagogue, it is being treated as a federal hate crime and will be handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the assistance of local, county and state police, he added. The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement. First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, and the injured have been taken to three area hospitals with level one trauma centers, Hissrich said. "Without their courage, this tragedy would have been far worse," said Hissrich said. Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who was not at the synagogue at the time, told ABC News he was "stunned" and "sorry" to hear of the shooting. He said he had stayed home from services Saturday morning because his wife was sick and that he has not heard from friends who were in the building. Berkun, who lives nearby the synagogue, said police officers came to his door and told him to stay inside his home. He described the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, where the synagogue is located, as "a very Jewish neighborhood" which is "known as a Jewish community." "There's absolutely no crime, it's an amazing neighborhood," Berkun said. "It's hard to believe it's a city neighborhood. It's dominated by the Jewish community center four blocks away ... by kosher bakeries -- all kinds of Jewish gift shops, bookshops, a number of synagogues." "There is one major synagogue but there are at least five other synagogues within two miles of where we are," he said. When the gunman opened fire at the synagogue, law enforcement officers, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) swiftly responded to the scene. The suspect was apprehended a short time later. The synagogue is a conservative Jewish congregation, according to its website, and there was a morning Shabbat service scheduled from 9:45 a.m. to noon. Berkun said there are "three different religious groups that are meeting in our building on Saturday morning with three distinct services," estimating that there could have been approximately 75 people in the building at the time. Hissrich declined during the press conference to say how many people were inside at the time. By late Saturday afternoon, with the death toll at 11, President Donald Trump signaled that he will change the tone of his typical rally speeches, telling reporters that "tone is very important." He said he was enthusiastic about being on the campaign trail, but that Saturday's mass shooting had changed things. "Tonight, I will absolutely change my tone," he said. Earlier, speaking to reporters before boarding a flight to the event in Indiana, Trump called the attack "a shame," calling the suspect "a wacko" and a "maniac." He also said the suspect should "pay the ultimate price" and be subjected to the death penalty. When asked about whether the nation's gun laws should be changed, Trump said the synagogue should have had armed security there. "You want protection, and they didn’t have any protection, they had a maniac walk in," Trump said. "The results could have been much better." He said that before getting into office, he would think "what a shame, what a shame" when incidents like this one unfolded. "It’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this thing happen," Trump said. After he arrived Saturday afternoon, the president said the shooter appeared to be an "anti-Semitic crime." "That is something you wouldn't believe could still be going on," he added. After hinting earlier in the day that he might cancel Saturday night's rally out of respect for the dead and wounded in Pittsburgh, he told the crowd that he was inspired to attend the rally by the late New York Yankees' owner and friend George Steinbrenner -- and his resolve for the Yankees to play after the September 11th attacks in 2001. Trump also claimed that the US Stock Exchange remained open, though it was closed for six days after the attacks. Vice President Mike Pence offered his condolences on Twitter. "Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders,” he tweeted Saturday morning. "God bless them all." Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all. First lady Melania Trump said her "heart breaks" over the shooting, and that "the violence needs to stop." My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted that he was headed to Pittsburgh. "We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need," he wrote. On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need. By Saturday evening, residents of the Pittsburgh apartment building where Bowers lived who had been evacuated were allowed back into their apartments. One neighbor described the suspect to ABC News as a quiet loner who lived alone and didn't stick out as any sort of danger. The New York City Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department said that they are deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities as well. "The NYPD is deploying heavy weapons teams, including the officers from the Critical Response Command and the Strategic Response Team, to houses of worship across the City," the department said in a statement. "Additionally, sector cars in every command across New York City will be making additional visits to ensure the safety of all of our residents. Currently, there is no nexus to New York. But these steps are being taken until further information is learned about the events in Pittsburgh by the NYPD." Police in Washington, D.C., are also on alert. "We have reached out to Jewish community leaders and have directed officers to pay special attention to synagogues until further notice," a spokesperson for the D.C. police department said.

Police sources tell KDKA’s Andy Sheehan the gunman, Robert Bowers, walked into the building and yelled, “All Jews must die.” Sheehan’s sources also confirmed that eleven people have died. No children are among the deceased. Bowers was reportedly armed with an AR-15 and three handguns.

Two officers arrived on the scene and observed a male who was carrying an assault-style weapon, according to police. Bowers opened fire on the two officers and then retreated back into the building. One of the officers suffered a gunshot wound to the hand and the other officer received several cuts to his face from shrapnel and broken glass. RELATED LINKS: Pittsburgh SWAT officers arrived on scene, formed a small team and entered the building. Upon entering the building officers observed the devestation. SWAT medics carried two victims, one male and one female, outside of the building. The victims were transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. Officers began searching the third floor of the synagogue when they encountered Bowers again, who opened fire on the SWAT team. One officer was shot multiple times and critically wounded and another officer was also shot multiple times by Bowers. The remaining SWAT officers engaged Bowers while the two injured officers were carried outside to Pittsburgh Paramedics. Bowers was injured in the exchange of gunfire. After being taken into custody, the suspect made statements to an officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide on his people, according to authorities. It is believed that Bowers acted alone. (Photo Credit: KDKA Photojournalist Tim Lawson)  “I will emphasize at this time that there appears to be no active threat to the community. We believe the subject that is responsible for this has been taken into custody,” Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. Hissrich said at least six other people were injured, including several police officers. Two of the officers were among the first responders to the scene. At least one other was a member of the SWAT team. WATCH: Officials Hold Press Conference To Update Investigation: As of 5:30 p.m., three victims — a 61-year-old woman, a 55-year-old man, and a 27-year-old male officer — were in stable condition. Two victims — a 70-year-old man and a 40-year-old male SWAT officer — were in critical condition. One additional officer was treated and released. UPDATE AS OF 5:30 PM ON SATURDAY, OCT. 27, 2018: A 61-year-old female is in stable condition. A 70-year-old male is in critical condition. A 55-year-old male officer is in stable condition. More ⬇️. pic.twitter.com/KfHfqb2Dut — UPMC (@UPMCnews) October 27, 2018 Another person was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. According to multiple sources, that person is the suspect in the shooting. The suspect was reportedly shot multiple times and was last listed in fair condition. The shooting happened during weekly Shabbat services at the synagogue. The building was full of people for a Saturday service and police said they received several calls from people barricaded inside. A heavy police presence blocked off a section of McAnulty Road in Baldwin Borough. It is believed Bowers lived in an apartment in that area. Police were in the process of obtaining a search warrant for the residence. Police are also investigating if Bowers announced his intentions on social media Saturday morning. That account has since been taken down.  One posting stated, “HIAS [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill out people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Hissrich said this shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and as such, the FBI is leading the investigation. “At this time this is being considered a federal violation and the primary investigative agency will be the Federal Bureau of investigation,” Hissrich said. “As the mayor mentioned, we’ve had a tragedy here today. The work of the first responders is what probably prevented it from becoming much more of a tragedy for what it is,” Hissrich said. (Photo Credit: KDKA) District attorney spokesman Mike Manko issued the following statement: “Senior prosecutors and detectives from our office have been monitoring this atrocity since the first reports. A deputy district attorney is on site and is coordinating the prosecution of this individual under state laws involving murder and federal laws involving domestic terrorism. District Attorney Zappala has been in touch with United States Attorney Scott Brady and as this progresses, they will work together to determine the appropriate forum in which to address these crimes. As we always do, we want to allow the families and survivors of this heinous and abhorrent act, and the Jewish Community of Pittsburgh, the time they need to grieve their loss. During this time, the investigation, led by the FBI, will continue and as we did following the murders committed by Richard Baumhammers, we will have a process evaluating the safety and potential vulnerabilities of synagogues, churches and schools. To that end, we have already reached out to leaders of the Jewish community as well as other leaders in the religious and educational community.” Federal charges were filed Saturday evening. Those charges include: Eleven counts each of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Death and Use of a Firearm to Commit Murder During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence, four counts of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Bodily Injury to a Public Safety Officer and three counts of Use and Discharge of a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the charges filed could lead to the death penalty. A phone number has been established for any questions from family members of the victims. That number is (412)-432-4400. A victims’ assistance and reunification center has also been set up on the campus of Chatham University. Grief counselors and representatives from the Red Cross will be on hand. (Photo Credit: KDKA) Thousands filled the streets of Squirrel Hill for a vigil Saturday evening. “That’s what makes Squirrel Hill such a great neighborhood. It’s probably one of the most diverse in not only the city, but across the state. This hits home to everyone. We saw people from different religions, ethnicities, they’re all gathering doing vigils,” Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O’Connor said. A GoFundMe page has also been set up to benefit the victims, their families and the synagogue. If you would like to donate, click here. Meanwhile, KDKA-TV spoke with several people familiar with what services would have been taking place on a normal Saturday morning. “At 9:45 there were three simultaneous congregations’ services that were being held,” he said. “In the main part of the building, The Tree of Life has a service that has about 40 people in it. Just below that there is a basement area where New Life congregation would have been having their Shabbat service. There would have been 30-40 people. Just adjacent to Tree of Light’s service area, a congregation was in the rabbi study room and they would have had approximately 15 people in there,” Michael Eisenberg, the past President of the Tree of Life, said. Chuck Diamond was a rabbi at Tree of Life for seven years. Diamond said possibly three rabbis would’ve been inside. Rabbi Pearlman from New Light was in the basement. Rabbi Cheryl Kline was in the social hall. Rabbi Meyers, the rabbi of Tree of Life, would have been in the chapel. “I was at home [when I found out]. I live right up the street around the corner and I started getting phone calls,” Diamond said. Meghan Schiller: Did you ever as rabbi think that you were gonna have to deal with this? Diamond: “I thought about it all the time, I have to tell you. When I was there, in the back of my mind, I always have the thought of something like this happening and what I would do, unfortunately, because of the world we live in.” Schiller: “What comes to mind when you hear that President Donald Trump just tweeted about this?” Diamond: “Well again, this is unfortunately it happens too often in this country and around the world that these things happen, so it affects us all, so I’m glad that he tweeted something and hopefully he’ll take positive action.” President Donald Trump called the shooting a “terrible thing” and said “it’s a shame to watch.” “It’s a terrible terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country, and frankly all over the world and something has be done,” Trump said. “It’s just a shame to watch this and to see it for so many years, so much of it, it’s a shame.” Earlier, Trump tweeted his thoughts to the Pittsburgh area amid the tragedy. Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018 Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018 Trump was asked about revisiting gun laws and said if those inside had protection, “maybe it could have been a much different situation.” “This has little to do with it. If they had protection inside the results would have been far better. This is a dispute that will always exist I suspect. But if they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a much different situation. But they didn’t and he was able to do things that unfortunately he shouldn’t have been able to do,” Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said today’s shooting wasn’t just a criminal act, it was evil. “What happened in Pittsburgh today was not just criminal, it was evil. An attack on innocent Americans and an assault on our freedom of religion. There is no place in America for violence or anti-Semitism and this evil must end,” Pence said. Meanwhile, Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered all commonwealth flags on the Capitol Complex, at commonwealth facilities, and throughout the state lowered to half-staff, effective immediately, in honor of all victims of the attack. He also issued the following statement regarding the incident: “The shooting in Pittsburgh this morning is an absolute tragedy. I have spoken with local leaders and my administration and the Pennsylvania State Police will provide any resources to assist local law enforcement and first responders. “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” Two of Pittsburgh’s professional sports teams, the Steelers and Penguins, also Tweeted their thoughts and prayers to the victims. We send our thoughts and prayers to those affected by this morning’s tragedy in Pittsburgh. We will continue to pray for everyone involved. — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) October 27, 2018 We are incredibly saddened to hear of this morning’s tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. We send our thoughts and prayers to all those affected. — Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) October 27, 2018 Stay with KDKA.com for this developing story. This is what happen in Germany . First the Communists ANTIFA started the violence,and then in reaction arose the NAZI party. Well this isn’t Germany or Europe, Patriots stand against both antifa and nazis, and if anyone tries to disarm the Jews here, tens of millions of Patriots will rise up in retaliation. God Bless America and be with these victims and their families. Have the deep, fake news media linked this shooter to President Trump or the Tea Party yet? Nope, but some trolls here are on the job! I thought that it was a foregone conclusion the NRAs responsible. Yep. They’ve tried. Either Islamo-Animals or Neo Nazi’s. The safe bet is on this being Muslim. During these days of increasing political violence we need to be armed for self defense. Many places of worship have armed members as security. So far no indication that this was done here. There are a number of cases where armed members stopped a killer. It is a sad fact that the police are minutes away when seconds count. Sorrow for those fallen. Madmen exist among us far and wide. Open carry may be the solution til Criminal Psychopaths respect law and order….and reopen Psych wards closed during the last few decades for 90 day, court ordered evaluation. There was a time when a mass shooting of this magnitude would have locked our nation’s attention. Not that we ever did anything about it beyond useless thoughts and prayers, but we at least took a passing look at it. Now it’s just another story, on Saturday morning. I feel so terrible for the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this (yet another) act of senseless violence. The comments on this thread are a shame – people are DEAD – whether you are right wing or left wing. Someone’s sister, brother, son, daughter, father, etc…Their relatives lives just stopped and they will have to bear this the rest of their days. We need to stop this incessant blaming. Our society has become nothing but hatred and yes this is the result. For one moment can we just bow our heads and pray? Sheeeyeah. ‘Better ask James Hodgkisson about that. Dems are RAH’thn STINKing commie statists. Yes, Bugsy we can and I stand with you in prayer. Thank you for your comment. 8 people are dead and the devastation to them and their families is really what is important here. Is good to see a compassionate voice in the comments after such an atrocity, Jews worshiping on Sabbath gunned down by a madman full of hate and evil. May God’s angels of comfort and peace surround all of the victim’s families and may fellow Americans and human beings have compassion for the victims and their families. In Jesus’ Name AMEN. The problem is that, as disgusting as it may seem, the left uses every opportunity, and will use this one, to advance their political agenda. Many of us are just anticipating it. Muslim or neo-Nazi …. either way, FRY HIM!! We cannot vote these xenophobic, racist misogynists out fast enough. Here’s to dems getting enough votes that Republicans can’t cheat themselves into another year of majority rule. Their policies, rhetoric and fear-mongering are literally killing people. Light on facts, heavy on delusion. What a HORRIBLE tragedy! May those poor souls rest in peace! I feel for their families. To me, virulent hatred of Jews equals hatred of God since they were God’s Chosen and also from whom Christ arose. To the idiots who blamed this on Trump: I cannot resist pointing out that the vile murderer was a Trump Hater. He was sort of the opposite of the loony idiot they caught yesterday down in Florida. Crazy, vile and murderous comes from both sides. The gunman told police: TRUMP 2020 And Satan said unto thee, “Get thee forth and sow falsehoods, chaos and perdition.” Prayers for all! What we need inour country is some peace’ not more violence, not more political speaches. The left hates Israel and Jews. They want more radical muslims entering the country. Why any Jew would vote for democrat hate and corruption is a true mystery! How ignorant people on the left are. Trump has done more to help Israel than any other President, including moving our embassy to Jerusalem. Jews have a friend in Donald Trump. We don’t know who the victims are and the shooter. This is simply a Halloween political spin off from the violence in our country at this time leading up to the Mid-Term Elections So at least 8 innocent people murdered by a mad man in a US community and all of you are only able to banter about your petty political beliefs and phobias How about thanking God that your family was not murdered and maybe say a prayer for the victims and their families. Oh I get it now, your god IS your political party and your ten commandments or sermon on the mount are spouted by Fox news or CNN in daily bullet points. You no longer fear God or his judgement! They haven’t released information on the suspect. “He is a white male” good old media. what happened to the charmingly worded comment about the 6 million in Pittsburg? Was it censored? Another October Surprise. Surprise. Ensure the shooter meets his maker ASAP! Should never deserve the mercy of a trial. Terminate them (shooter / bigot). The Pittsburgh School Board is blaming Chik-Fil-A. … and I suppose this nut-job will have a 20-year-long anti-jew rap-sheet, but, the MSM will claim it’s all Trump’s fault… again. My parents, sister, and myself were married in Pittsburgh and I was born there. I also have relatives there. This is a terrible event and people of good will need to come together to stop this. In Harrisburg, Pa. under the auspices of Rabbi Carl Choper is The Interfaith Alliance of Pennsylvania, whose mission it is to defuse conflict so people can learn to end their difference and work together. I am proud to be part of that organization. Hopefully, similar groups exist around the nation and internationally. Preach to the Democrat left; that is the seat of anti-Semitism in this country. Thoughts and prayers to the families of the deceased, and injured. Special thanks to the 3 officers who were injured stopping the human garbage . Canadian LEO (ret’d) NRA still insists that we all be allowed to own military style weapons, and “guns are not the problem”. Democrats always vote against Jews/Israel. We have a lot of fake Jew politicians who hate Jews. They subscribe to the Muslim Quran scripture of lying and deceit to justify the ends. Doesn’t surprise me a liberal shot up and murdered these people. Democrats have been accusing Jews of murdering Palestinians and stealing their land and all sorts of conspiracy nonsense. I can’t believe some of these comments haven’t been deleted as they spew hate. And I do think that the police were “packing heat” They’ll blame this on Trump, the hero of Israel, the only President with the courage to move the capitol to Jerusalem, and try to paint his as anti-semitic, not to mention his Jewish son-in-law. Sadly, most democrats are stupid enough to believe it. Has CNN found a way to blame it on Trump yet? Lets start the “Blame Trump” countdown clock. Meanwhile, there are a lot of people dead and a lot of families in unimaginable pain. Why cant this just be about them? Why cant we try to figure out what breaks in a persons head to make them the monster that would do this? The shooter didn’t understand the difference between a Jew and a Zionist. Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Zionists are Jews. Zionists hide behind Jews. 9-11 was a Zionist job. USS Liberty was a Zionist job. Holocaust Hoax was a Zionist job. My thoughts and prayers to all those affected. It’s a sad day when violent lunatics feel compelled to target innocent people, and in this case an interfaith place of worship. Truly ridiculous. At the end of the day, hyper violent lunatics sometimes hide in the shadows, simply awaiting opportunity. After my military service an armed home invader hit a home I was having dinner at, having the means to defend myself saved many lives, including a young child. Had I not had access to my sidearm that day, I would not be typing this message. ….again, my thoughts to the victims of this madness. Indeed. Was the intruder armed with a gun? Prayers for all whose family members and friends were killed or injured. Prayers that the suspect will be punished for his crime. God Bless America and all our citizens! This is not a political crime, for it is a hate crime against Jews, per the suspect’s comments. No blame should be placed on anyone but the suspect! ❤ Meanwhile, the media is scrambling to find a way to blame this event on a Conservative or Trump supporter. If the shooter ever used the letters M,A(2),G then it is all Trump’s fault. Eight people are dead, more are injured. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the fallen and those who are injured. I am thankful that the shooter is in custody. To those who would make this about politics, I say to you that you may need to reexamine your priorities. Find your human compassion. Take care of those who need care first. Any other priority–your politics, your gun rights–can come later. People are shocked and mourning. What can you do to make the situation better now, in this moment, person to person? Fighting about open carry and spreading conspiracy theories doesn’t help anyone. Every church and synagogue in America should have armed guards watching the doors. Plus, doors should be locked once the service starts with guards either letting people in or denying them entrance. The guards can be openly carrying or have their guns concealed. Its a good thing there were no armed civilians inside…otherwise, someone might have got hurt! Pathetic of the governor to politicize the horror by blaming guns. I wonder where the governor falls on capital punishment, because we have a textbook case of someone deserving of it, where there is no possibility of convicting an innocent. A friend of mine is a part of a security detail at his local church. They are armed and have wireless communication between detail members. You can either be prepared, or you can be a victim – it’s your choice. I’m absolutely sure this was a Trump-loving white supremacist. He encourages violence, and his brownshirts are listening. When he called himself a “nationalist,” the far right wing nuts praised him. When he refused to condemn them after Charlottesville, they praised him. They do Nazi salutes while shouting “Hail Trump.” This is stochastic terrorism, and the majority of terrorist attacks in the US come from these people. This is an undebatable fact, and nothing is being done. In fact, Trump cut funding to counter right wing violence. https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/346552-trump-cut-funds-to-fight-anti-right-wing-violence Trump loves Israel. He moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem. His son in law is Jewish. His daughter is Jewish. His grandchildren are Jewish. Jews have no better friend than President Trump. However, the the mass killer said he hates Trump and did not vote for him. Which means you have more in common with this killer of Jews, than President Trump. Unfortunately, my first thought was that it was another Demacrat/deep state ploy to blame on Repubs before the election. It is unfortunate that this is what entered my mind first before my compassion and concern for all the innocent victims kicked in Guns make a country safe right gun nuts??? if trump wasn’t president there would be no gun violence. Right, because there was none under Obama. Are you kidding me? Is that sarcasm? People are warlike. They need to be taught to not be like this, and that hasn’t happened for many years. And the nonstop vitriol that’s been going on amongst EVERYONE for years now is going to produce this. We need to be able to protect ourselves. It’s natural law. Louis Farrakhan is laughing. So, when are the Democrats going to come to his defense? After all Barack Obama made excuses for the Iranians doing the exact same thing for 8 years and the Democrat party as a whole has told us not to vilify Muslims every day since 9/11 even while hundreds of millions of them chant death to jews daily. Obama even sent the Iranian Mullahs pallets full of cash as they chanted and preyed for death to all jews. The Governor said: ” Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.” He had to politicize it…just had to. Do we blame pencils when media bias distorts the truth and destroys lives? Vote out of office, all the treacherous “officials” who would sacrifice our freedom for personal gain. MAGA bomber deaths – 0. Trump hating bigot deaths – 8. In Israel the government would arrest and charge Trump and Republicans for incitement because he has a big filthy dumb stupid mouth to match his nasty foul reactionary personality that lends itself to neo-fascist racist undemocratic anti-republican causes. Long live the republic to hell with Trump Republicans and the corrupt Democrats that support and tolerate them. >”a heavy-set white male” Why is race mentioned and not the usual “suspect-teen-youth-person” descriptor used when non-whites commit crimes? Let’s see. This guy was a Nazi and hated Trump. Democrats also hate Trump. I guess by liberal logic, that makes all Democrats Nazis. It is a very said comment on the state of the world, when people can not worship in the house of their G-d without fear of being gunned down. There is nothing sacred left!! THE JEWISH QUESTION Here is the answer It’s the book of Revelation – written by Egyptians (you can look it up) – a false prophecy. Blood letting, poisoning the wells. It’s history now. It’s the fear of God + superstition + peer pressure. This book inverts the teachings of Christ. My Twitter page tells the full story. ChrisGrinnin Here is the answer It’s the book of Revelation – written by Egyptians (you can look it up) – a false prophecy. Blood letting, poisoning the wells. It’s history now. It’s the fear of God + superstition + peer pressure. This book inverts the teachings of Christ. My Twitter page tells the full story. ChrisGrinnin Don’t do the witches brew double trouble That’s not a human way to live Certainly not Christ like This will make Faquhan happy . Now let’s remember the pictures of him and Obama yucking it up and the picture of Bill Clinton sitting on the same stage with him at Aretha Franklin’s funeral services. WOW it seems he was inspired by Louis Farrakhan. You know Obama’s friend. And the shooter posted all of his Nazi hate propaganda at he Alt-right site “Gab”. Why is this not a surprise . . . Antisemitism is a direct derivative of Nationalism and always precedes a wave of terror against Others. Jews are always targeted as enemies of the State as easily identified as not US. Sincere religious folks do not accept the authority of the State as the highest Authority. Until I see real dead people and a real crime scene I will take this event with the same disbelief as Sandy Hook. Just like Batman and Las Vegas and other staged shootings, keep your smarts about you because the fakery is everywhere in this nation of news “makers” and news “tellers” . Same people involved and they are known for lying throughout history. You can thank Nancy Pelosi and Mad Maxine Waters for all the violence. They encourage it. Sadly to say, you sound like lunatics, completely unknowing about the real world, misinformed, manipulated, working against your own best interest. The rest of the world would really like to show you compassion, but you make it extremely hard for us, your closest allies. I guess we are feeling more sorry for your dead and bereaved than you are yourselves. Sad, sad, sad. Congratulations media — 11 more deaths thanks to your churning up the hatred and backing these kind of people be they BLM, Antifa or anti Semitics so that your left wing hating killers go after the Jews like those in Trump’s own family. But you don’t care as long as you get your pound of flesh and a lead story to trash Trump with. I can’t wait to see which political party will try to use this disgusting event to try and raise money for their agenda come November. I am reading the comments with this story, and I am ashamed at the hatred, and I would say the fear that drives that hatred. The problems with this country come from ourselves. Let’s own up to it, admit it, and deal with it.  Oh, right, Drumpf!!! Why should Jews have to have armed guards in their synagogues? Should all churches and mosques also have to do so? That’s nonsense, and it is encouraged by your hateful remarks which divide our nation into THEM and US. Shame on you, and your disgusting Nazi-like attitudes. And, of course, you take no responsibility for your own rhetoric. Did you or your colleagues take any responsibility for your rhetoric in constantly calling Trump Racists and Nazis for 2 years? You know, you claim everybody else has to accept responsibility for their rhetoric, but you don’t want to have any responsibility for your rhetoric or your actions. Liberals must be defeated not convinced Sadly, another shooting occurred in a gun free zone. When will people understand that gun free zones don’t work? What good is a Swat team today, they have no authority. The shooter should have been taken out feet first now the liberals will find him a supposedly good lawyer to get him off on a technicality.Until we put the fear in these animal that their lives will end for committing such heinous crimes it will continue.When the penalties for killing a Moose is greater than killing a human being something is wrong with out legal system. warn your children: “stay away from gun-free zones. they are too dangerous.” “With gentiles, it will be like any person: They need to die, but God will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money. This is his servant. That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew,” said the rabbi, who recently turned 90. Positive action would be loosening gun laws so people have the ability to IMMEDIATELY defend themselves in such a situation. I think average police response time is about 10 minutes which is way too long to endure a continual barrage of bullets. PD responded in this situation amazingly fast. Prayers for all….. Males are territorial animals. They establish *societies based a race/ language/ religion.It is how the human animal is. No male group in human history has been subjected to the kind of compulsory integration – race/ gender /’group’ nullification – like white Christian males. Using our legislative system to do this is WRONG. We now have human waves of racial groups/ religious groups, you name the “groups’ …descending on America to strip white males of everything they have/ built/ occupy. We have a political party – the DEMS – dedicated to doing exactly this.. Civil rights laws (invented by white males in the 60s) are the culprit. But no way to rid the system of these diabolical laws. So bad tings will continue to happen. Written laws were NEVER intended to be used to defeat/ deny/ defeat what is part of human nature. Jews have been kicked out of over 130 countries, over 200 times, Youtube it.. Why must they continue with their evil ways? Jews, please stop your deviant actions in the media. Here’s the question I want to know . . . who are his people? That should give you motive and opportunity? So when do CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC the NYT and Washington Post begin blaming this on Mad Maxine, Nancy Pelosi, Obama, Hillary, Holder, Schumer and their own “Fake News” people for inciting violence in the streets and even in people’s homes with their divisive rhetoric?! Gave himself up. Evidently he chose 3 squares, conjugal visits and healthcare for the next 40 years. “Thanks, PA!” fake story…Nothing but a lie… Can’t blame Trump or the NRA. The blame for these killings falls on the courts, the schools, the home and greed. Unless we put correctness and discipline back in society, we will continue to see this more and more until one day, a victim will be you or a loved one. But then, no one will care. It is time to change that and fast. George Vreeland Hill I am a Jewish woman and I am so sorry that your Synagogue had to deal with a senseless shooting like this. I pray to GOD that healing will begin for each and every one of you. May the dead RIP!!! I love my background and will never disown where I come from. Love to each and everyone of you that reads this. Ann Lynn KDKA needs to shut down the comments section. Many bots writing some really disgusting comments. Families are trying to come together tonight. I lived in Pittsburgh for four years. It’s a nice town that doesn’t deserve violence of any kind. There are very wicked men and women who walk this Earth, and some of them are NUTS. If you are a decent person, this world needs you, and it needs you ARMED. After THIS incident, we wont be turning in our weapons to ANYBODY. Rather we will be buying MORE GUNS, and MORE AMMO. “Anti-racists” say there’s a RACE problem. They say it’ll be solved when non-Whites pour into ALL & ONLY White nations and “assimilate” to get a brown mixture. They say only White nations have this RACE problem; they say non-White nations are fine. If I object to my own genocide these “anti-racists” say I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews. They say they’re anti-racist. What they are is anti-White. Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White. Donald trump the head of all this issues, He makes people hate any body or any country or any relgious shame of this country with all guns issue , They can not stop it all about money money money Guy’s a dead ringer for Joe Manchin. The guy hated Trump and voted for Hillary..IMO, that makes him a Democrat Hillary supporters are dangerous. Tom Wolf’s message regarding weapons that shouldn’t be in the hands of the public….sorry, it’s not the weapons, it’s the sick minds that commit these acts. America is full of people with little regard for life. There has to be a change in the spiritual nature of America, a renewed respect for life, the law, for one another. The blood of 11 Jewish people is on President Trump’s hands, as he declared himself a “Nationalist” (another name for a Nazi) within days of this horrendous massacre. And for him to suggest that armed guards inside the synagogue would have lessened the number of fatalities shows just how clueless Trump is regarding the nature of Jewish people to use words and not guns to defuse potentially volatile situations. Trump needs to be removed from office. Period. One thing always left out of the conversation is who to pray to. Yeshua Hamashiàch said ‘no man comes to the father, but by me’ . Also, ‘ if you have seen me, you have seen the father’. So get the address right. Jesus of Nazareth. Heaven.

---split---10.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-north-valley-shooting-20181028-story.html#nt=related-content---split---Loren Lieb and Donna Finkelstein were on their way to Lancaster on Saturday to campaign against a congressional candidate who opposes strict gun control laws when the two women received a call with news about a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Eleven people were killed and six injured, in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history. The two longtime friends were stunned. “When is something going to change?” Lieb wondered. The women bonded nearly 20 years ago after another tragic incident in which a self-professed white supremacist walked into the North Valley Jewish Community Center armed with a semiautomatic weapon and began shooting. Lieb’s 6-year-old son and Finkelstein’s 16-year-old daughter were among the five people wounded. Since then, Lieb and Finkelstein have become involved with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and are board members of Women Against Gun Violence. “We have a special bond,” Finkelstein said. “We both took this tragic shooting and we became activists. We know that we do whatever we can to prevent future gun violence.” The mothers had never met before the Aug. 10, 1999, shooting at the community center. Finkelstein’s daughter, Mindy, was a counselor and Lieb’s son, Josh Stepakoff, was attending summer day camp. That morning, Josh had just finished a game of “capture the flag” and was walking down the main corridor of the community center when he came face-to-face with a person he thought was a construction worker. The man turned out to be the shooter, Buford Furrow Jr. Of the five people wounded that day, three were children ages 5 and 6. After the rampage, Furrow left the center and fatally shot a mail carrier in Chatsworth. Furrow is currently serving a life sentence. Although Josh was shot in the leg and the hip, he remembers only running. Mindy was with another camper when she was shot twice and managed to escape with the child. On Saturday morning, Mindy Finkelstein was in bed with her 7-month-old daughter and her husband in the Bay Area when she received texts from family members asking if she’d heard about the Pittsburgh shooting. As she watched the news, she felt “an overwhelming sense of survivor’s guilt.” “I also had a deeper sense of sadness that not much has changed in almost 20 years and actually, now more than ever, gun violence and hate are more prevalent than they were when I was shot,” she said. Now 35, Mindy criticized the easy accessibility to guns, as well as the sheer power of the weapons available. Saturday’s shooting unfolded over 20 minutes at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, known locally for being the historical hub of the city’s Jewish community. The gunman, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, officials said. During negotiations for Bowers’ surrender, an officer at the scene radioed that Bowers was saying that “all these Jews need to die.” He was charged late Saturday on 29 counts, including 11 counts of murder with a firearm, and several hate crime charges such as obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. The Anti-Defamation League reported earlier this year that "anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. rose 57% in 2017 — the largest single-year increase on record and the second-highest number reported since ADL started tracking such data in 1979." Mindy’s daughter is growing up Jewish and she said she wants her “to be proud of that.” “I don’t want her to shy away from it or hide it and I don’t want to hide it. I want to be proud of my heritage,” Mindy said. “The leaders of this country have a responsibility to make it known that this hate that is being spewed out everywhere is wrong and it’s actually killing people.” President Trump, in his first comment to reporters on the shooting, called for armed guards at synagogues and implied that lax security by the synagogue was at least partially to blame for the high death toll. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better," he said. "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him, frankly.” After the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting, the center installed gates, a guard shack and an armed security guard who worked around the clock, all of which came at a huge financial cost to the organization, according to Nina Lieberman, who oversaw the community center at the time. A Los Angeles police officer kept watch at the site for weeks. Lieberman’s 6-year-old son was enrolled in the summer camp and witnessed the shooting. The community center saw a small dip in enrollment after the shooting, said Lieberman, who was associate executive director of the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles at the time. It was a precursor to a bigger blow just a few years later when parents pulled their kids out of preschools and summer camps in large numbers after the 9/11 terrorist attacks out of fear of sending their children to Jewish centers. The drop in revenue played a significant role in causing a financial crisis for the organization, Lieberman said. The Granada Hills site was shuttered in the early 2000s and the land was sold. Members of the community later joined other groups and formed the Valley Jewish Community Center in Woodland Hills. Still, the tragedy in 1999 brought the greater community together, with preschool held the very next day at an Episcopal church next door, Lieberman said. “We made a very conscious decision to act like a community center and provide a sense of belonging,” she said. “We took it as an opportunity to create a sense of togetherness, to say, ‘We are not going to fall because of your behavior.’” After Donna Finkelstein’s husband called her Saturday with the news, she spent most of the day weeping. So did Lieb. The women would spend several hours together canvassing neighborhoods in Lancaster. As they knocked on each door, Finkelstein was fearful about what could happen. “Because you don’t know who has a gun,” Finkelstein said.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH – The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 6:50 p.m. At least 2,000 mourners packed Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh and thousands more stood outside at a vigil for the 11 who were killed during Sabbath services at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said he began services at 9:45, and the shooting started a few minutes later. He said there were 12 in the sanctuary at the time, most sitting in the back. Myers said: "I helped pull out the people that I could from the front. But, alas, I had eight people in the back. One fortunately survived." Myers said: "I'm a survivor. I'm a mourner." He added: "Seven of my congregants were shot dead in my sanctuary. My holy place has been defiled." ___ 6:20 p.m. The rabbi of the New Light Congregation who is credited with shepherding some of the congregants behind a door and saving their lives during Saturday's shooting spoke at a vigil in Pittsburgh Sunday night. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman's voice cracked with emotion as he spoke of losing three pillars of the community who, he said, "would give you the shirt off their back." He said they volunteered not only at the synagogue but in the community at large. Said Perlman: "What happened yesterday will not break us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together." He added: "We will not be ruined by this event." ___ 5:55 p.m. Hundreds of people have gathered in the nation's capital to remember the 11 congregants killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. A vigil was held Sunday evening in Washington's Dupont Circle to pay tribute to those killed a day earlier at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Mourners sang and prayed together. Others held lit candles and held signs, including one that read "Tree of Life victims deserve better." Some in the crowd wept as the names of the 11 victims were read aloud. Police say the suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, told police he wanted to "kill Jews." Eight men and three women were killed when Bowers opened fire. The FBI said he was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns. Bowers faces federal and state charges. He's due in court Monday. ___ 4:25 p.m. Two brothers killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were an inseparable, warm-hearted pair who never missed Saturday services. That's according to ACHIEVA, an organization that provides services to people with disabilities and had worked with Cecil and David Rosenthal for years. ACHIEVA Vice President Chris Schopf recalls 59-year-old Cecil's infectious laugh and 54-year-old David's gentle spirit. Schopf says the two "looked out for one another" and were "kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Their sister is chief of staff to state Rep. Dan Frankel, who recalls seeing the brothers at Tree of Life whenever he went there. He calls them "very sweet, gentle, caring men." __ 4:05 p.m. Richard Gottfried was a devoted member of the New Light Congregation, going to the synagogue every Saturday morning without fail. He was killed Saturday as a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Stephen Cohen, the co-president of New Light, says Gottfried and another member who was also killed Saturday were the "religious heart of our congregation." "They led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. The 65-year-old Gottfried was also preparing for a new chapter in his life. The dentist, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not afford dental care normally, was preparing to retire in the next few months. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife, Peg Durachko. __ 3:30 p.m. Israel's president is sending a message of solidarity after the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Israel stands with the Jewish victims and the Pittsburgh community. In a videotaped message set to open an interfaith vigil Sunday, President Reuven Rivlin will tell participants: "You are not alone! The people of Israel and the entire Jewish people stand with you!" That's according to a transcript of the message provided by his office. "We must say loud and clear — this was an act of anti-semitism," Rivlin says, according to the transcript. "We cannot, we must not, we will not ignore it or tolerate it." Rivlin, who acts in a mostly ceremonial capacity, will conclude his message of consolation by reciting the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. __ 2:50 p.m. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is joining the city's religious leaders and other elected officials to condemn the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and vowing to protect the city's Jewish communities from violence. The Democrat spoke outside a Manhattan synagogue Sunday afternoon with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, including Roman Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan and the Rev. Al Sharpton. De Blasio says the people of New York stand with the 11 victims of Saturday's shooting and their families. He says, "Violence against people because of their faith does not represent our values." De Blasio says city police will be out in force to protect synagogues and Jewish centers. __ 2 p.m. Daniel Stein, who was among the 11 people shot dead inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday, was a very visible member of the city's Jewish community as a leader in the New Light Congregation. The co-president of the area's Hadassah chapter, Nancy Shuman, says Judaism was very important to the 71-year-old Stein. His wife, Sharyn, is the chapter's membership vice president. Shuman says, "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." Halle says Stein "was somebody that everybody liked." __ 1:45 p.m. Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg was among the 11 victims of a gunman who opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday. The 74-year-old spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center. She retired in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects, including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, says she is devastated by the murder of her colleague and friend. Leinhardt says, "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being." 1:30 p.m. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns have observed a moment of silence at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field for the 11 people killed by a gunman inside a synagogue in the city Saturday. There were other such tributes at NFL games elsewhere Sunday. Eight men and three women were murdered inside the Tree of Life Synagogue. The names of the victims, which included a pair of brothers and a married couple, were released Sunday. In a statement issued before Sunday's game, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the slayings the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." __ 1 p.m. A law enforcement official says the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue had a license to carry firearms and legally owned his guns. The official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke Sunday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Police say Robert Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Court papers say Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Federal prosecutors have charged Bowers with 29 criminal offenses and state authorities have also leveled charges. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. — Michael Balsamo in Washington __ 11:40 a.m. Condolences and remembrances of the 11 victims of the deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday are beginning to roll out on social media and in emails. They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors. Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus sent an email to his former coworkers Sunday asking them to pass along his condolences to the family of Jerry Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician. Claus says Rabinowitz was more than a physician for him and his family for the past three decades, saying, "he was truly a trusted confidant and healer." He says Rabinowitz had an uplifting demeanor and would provide sage advice. ___ 11:20 a.m. A neighbor of the man charged in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre says the suspect kept to himself. Chris Hall said Sunday that he never heard or saw anything to indicate that 46-year-old Robert Bowers harbored anti-Semitic views or posed a threat. Authorities say Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team shot and wounded him. Bowers faces state and federal charges. Hall says nothing stood out about Bowers. He says "the most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed." Six others were wounded in the attack, including four officers, one of whom remains in critical condition. Two worshippers also remain hospitalized, one of them in critical condition. ___ 10 a.m. The 11 people killed in the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh included a married couple, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, and two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal. The Allegheny County medical examiners' office released the victims' names Sunday. David Rosenthal was the youngest at 54. The eldest was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. The dead also included Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Jerry Rabinowitz, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax and Irving Younger. Fellow members of the New Light Congregation say Wax was a pillar of the congregation, filling many roles there. Friend Myron Snider says Wax was a retired accountant who was unfailingly generous. Wax was in his late 80s. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Bowers is being treated for gunshot wounds and is due in court Monday. ___ 9:30 a.m. Authorities have released the names of the 11 people killed by a gunman during worship services in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials said at a news conference Sunday that the victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Officials previously said three women and eight men were killed. Bowers has been arrested and is being treated for gunshot wounds at a hospital. The U.S. attorney's office has charged Bowers with 29 federal counts. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. State authorities have also leveled charges. ___ 8 a.m. German leaders are mourning the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and stressing the need to push back against anti-Semitism. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." President Frank-Walter Steinmeier voiced his dismay at the attack, which left 11 dead, in a condolence message to U.S. President Donald Trump. Steinmeier wrote that "this abhorrent crime reminds us all to do what is in our power to advocate against hatred and violence, against anti-Semitism and exclusion, and to counter with determination those who incite them." ___ 7:30 a.m. Pope Francis is grieving with Pittsburgh's Jewish community following the massacre at a synagogue, denouncing the "inhuman act of violence" and praying for an end to the "flames of hatred" that fueled it. Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter's Square, a day after a gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews opened fire in the synagogue during Sabbath services, killing 11 people. Francis prayed for the dead, injured and their families and said: "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence." He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." Francis has frequently spoken out against religiously inspired violence and has denounced the easy availability of guns thanks to weapons manufacturers, whom he has called "merchants of death." ___ 7 a.m. Police say the suspect in the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue told officers that Jews were committing genocide and that he wanted them all to die. Pittsburgh police said in an arrest affidavit made public early Sunday that Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. A Pittsburgh police officer says in the warrant that Bowers was being treated for his injuries when he said Jews were "committing genocide to his people." Bowers is charged with 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The police affidavit says calls began coming in to 911 just before 10 a.m. Saturday, reporting "they were being attacked." ___ 12:30 a.m. A gunman who expressed hatred of Jews exploited a vulnerability common in so many houses of worship across the country — doors that are unlocked for worship — to target a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials say Robert Bowers was armed with a rifle and three handguns when he walked inside the Tree of Life synagogue during Sabbath services Saturday morning and opened fire, killing 11 people and wounding six in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Police swarmed the building and traded gunfire with the gunman, who was shot multiple times but survived. Four police officers are among the wounded.

On Sunday, Erick Erickson appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to talk right wing conspiracies. “If you’re a conservative who’s at war with the truth, you’re not really a conservative,” Erickson — who has repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories — said, in his attempt to speak to conservatives now that more is known about the mail bomb suspect, Cesar Sayov. Erickson’s words sparked outrage on social media because Erickson is a conservative conspiracy theory generating machine, recently pushing a conspiracy about the migrant caravan (an issue that factored into the Pittsburgh shooter’s outrage) and... DCCC Chairman Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) and NRCC Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers (R-OH) traded accusations of anti-Semitism today on Meet the Press in a joint appearance that host Chuck Todd billed as being in the spirit of coming together. Despite a few platitudes, however, it wasn’t exactly unity on the schedule. “In the spirit of doing this together, they both agreed to come on together,” said Chuck Todd as he introduced the two guests. But that togetherness was not to last. Todd played a clip showing a woman in Pittsburgh appealing to leadership in the wake of tragedies, and when he asked t...

While Congress has appeared sharply divided in recent months, House Speaker Paul Ryan criticized the news media for not talking more about bipartisan achievements, chiding the industry for engaging in a “ratings chase” instead. “I don’t think it sells for you guys, for the media,” he told Face the Nation‘s John Dickerson in an interview that aired Sunday. “You take a look at the bills we pass out of the House, about a thousand bills.

Fox Business Network issued a statement on Sunday condemning remarks made by a guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight that many have decried as anti-Semitic. On Thursday’s episode of the Fox Business Network show, Chris Farrell, the director of Judicial Watch, baselessly claimed that the migrant caravan in Mexico is being funded by the “Soros-occupied State Department.” A rerun of that episode was aired on Saturday, following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania synagogue that left 11 people dead. The gunman, who was charged with hate crimes, frequently posted anti-Semitic conspiracy theorie...

Stelter first turned to Weekly Standard editor at large Bill Kristol, who was targeted by name at President Donald Trump‘s rally Saturday night, held after the shooting.

At his rallies, supporters have often taken to chanting “CNN sucks!” This week, the man who allegedly sent pipe bombs to CNN’s headquarters in New York was arrested, and his van had stickers saying “CNN SUCKS” and “DISHONEST MEDIA” all over it.

Following a week of violence from mass murders to a string of attempted bombings, President Donald Trump‘s critics are demanding the commander in chief tamp down his often divisive and incendiary rhetoric. In the wake of 11 deaths in Saturday’s anti-Semitic shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, NBC’s Chuck Todd said “it’s hard not to look at it and see that it is connected” to a rise in fiery politics. “We have a problem and we have a president who doesn’t seem to believe he has a role to play in dealing with it, and I think that is what is making this more of a[n] uncomfortable situation in ...

On Saturday night, First Son Eric Trump attempted to distance politics and the right from the actions of the alleged Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooter Robert Bowers. Speaking with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro, the Trump son made it clear, at least in his view, Bowers was deranged. “At the end of the day, this is obviously a very sick, deranged human — A sick, deranged person to do this,” Eric Trump said. “It seems we have gotten to a point in life and society where everything has to be kind of politicized…Somebody has to point a political finger at absolutely everything.” He added: “At the end o... Mark Hetfield, President and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, spoke out hours after the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that was reportedly prompted, in part, by the shooter’s hatred toward HIAS’s work of supporting immigrants. “There is a growing space in this country for hate speech. And hate speech always turns into hate actions. And that’s what we are seeing again and again this week,” Hetfield told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin. “Our focus needs to be on fighting hate.

Speaking on CNN on Saturday, Rabbi Joshua Stanton responded to President Donald Trump blaming the death toll in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre to a lack of security. “This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately,” Trump opined when speaking to reporters hours after the attack. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better.” Stanton said this about Trump’s words on the day of the shooting: “The words that I heard from our president today were deeply disappointing. He had one job, to provide comfort for t... On the same day as a shooter opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue killing 11, President Donald Trump went ahead with his rally in Illinois.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-pittsburgh-synagogue-20181027-story.html#nt=tertiarynavbar---split---A man with a history of posting anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant social media messages burst into a synagogue in Pittsburgh and opened fire on Saturday morning services that included a baby-naming ceremony, killing 11 people and wounding six more, authorities said. The shooting, which began shortly before 10 a.m., was probably “the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States” and marks a worrying new peak in violence against Jewish Americans in recent years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century. It came just days after a flurry of explosive devices were mailed to prominent Democrats and other critics of President Trump, further ratcheting up a sense of tension in the nation in the closing weeks of an intense midterm election campaign. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors, who are investigating the killings as a hate crime, could seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter, who is in custody. The shooting unfolded over 20 minutes at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s placid Squirrel Hill neighborhood, known locally for being the historical hub of the city’s Jewish community; many residents had decorated their lawns in preparation for Halloween. The gunman, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, officials said. The assailant wounded two of the first officers who arrived at the scene as he tried to leave, and later wounded two SWAT officers inside the synagogue before he was shot and taken into custody, officials said. During negotiations for Bowers’ surrender, an officer at the scene radioed that Bowers was saying that “all these Jews need to die.” Bowers had a history of making anti-Semitic posts on social media, and he had apparently signaled his plans to attack the synagogue in a post 17 days ago on Gab, a small social media service that is popular with white nationalists. On Oct. 10, an account bearing Bowers’ name posted a link to the website for HIAS, a refugee agency that was originally founded to assist Jews but that has expanded its work to include aid to refugees from around the world. The link Bowers shared included a list of congregations partnering with HIAS, including Pittsburgh’s Dor Hadash congregation — which holds services in the Tree of Life building. “We appreciate the list of friends you have provided,” Bowers wrote on Gab. Saturday morning at 9:49, Bowers published another post: “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.” Five minutes later, police received their first 911 call reporting a shooting inside Tree of Life Synagogue. The suspect remained hospitalized as of Saturday afternoon. He was charged in the evening with 29 counts of violence and firearms violations as rattled public officials vowed swift and severe justice. The charges included 11 counts of “obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death.” Bob Jones, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, called the shooting “the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” “Members of the Tree of Life Synagogue conducting a peaceful service in their place of worship were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," he said. Because the shooting is being treated as a hate crime, the FBI quickly took charge of the investigation, coordinating with local law enforcement, authorities said. Bowers probably acted alone and had no known criminal record, Jones said. Law enforcement officials familiar with the case confirmed that they believe the social media posts were made by the shooting suspect. Bowers’ reference to “optics” in the Saturday morning post is a significant one within the small world of white nationalists, signaling that the suspect had a familiarity with the political dynamics of the American white nationalist movement. It alludes to debate among far-right figures over whether to avoid violence or aggression, which often draws negative attention to the movement from the general public. Mark Hetfield, chief executive of HIAS, said he was "in a state of shock" to hear that his organization was named by the shooter. "It's horrible,” Hetfield said. The refugee resettlement group had organized a "refugee Shabbat" event last week at which more than 300 synagogues across the country came together to "celebrate our tradition of welcoming refugees." He said it was unclear whether the Pittsburgh synagogue had participated. "It's horrible that refugees are fleeing for aid, and the Jewish community is doing so much to embrace them and then this tragedy unfolds.” HIAS, founded in 1881 as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to assist Jews fleeing persecution in Russia, since 2000 has served a broad range of refugees of all faiths from around the world, helping them resettle in the U.S. President Trump, in his first comment to reporters on the shooting, called for armed guards at synagogues and implied that lax security by the synagogue was at least partially to blame for the high death toll. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better," he said. "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him, frankly.” Local officials said they were unaware of any security hired by the synagogue. Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said local synagogues have done "lots of training on things like active shooters, and we've looked at hardening facilities as much as possible." “This should not be happening, period,” he told reporters at the scene. “This should not be happening in a synagogue.” Trump called the attack an “anti-Semitic act” that “shocked and stunned” the nation and the world. “It looks definitely like it’s an anti-Semitic crime. That is something you wouldn’t believe could still be going on,” he told reporters when he arrived in Indianapolis for a speech. Later, reading from a prompter while addressing the Future Farmers of America, Trump said: “Today with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti-Semitism and every other form of evil.” The president later issued an order calling for the American flag to be flown at half staff at all federal buildings through Oct. 31. Despite Trump’s reference to anti-Semitism as something relegated to the past, the ADL reported earlier this year that "anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. rose 57% in 2017 — the largest single-year increase on record and the second-highest number reported since ADL started tracking such data in 1979." Although small by the standards of Los Angeles or New York, the Jewish community in Pittsburgh is one of the nation’s oldest, and Squirrel Hill, a tree-lined residential neighborhood about 10 minutes east of downtown, has been its hub since the 1930s. About a quarter of the metropolitan region’s Jewish population, estimated at roughly 50,000, lives in the neighborhood, according to a study released earlier this year by Pittsburgh’s Jewish Federation. The synagogue is a large concrete building, its facade punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows. Among its treasures is a "Holocaust Torah," rescued from the former Czechoslovakia, according to its website. Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250, although on a typical Saturday, attendance would be much lower. Several hours after the shooting, a sharp smell of match strikes wafted over a crowd of several hundred, many holding candles, as they gathered a few blocks from the synagogue for a vigil organized by local high school students. Christian Nutini, 43, who lives near the synagogue, brought his children. The youngest sat on his shoulders holding a handwritten cardboard sign that said hate and violence are not the answer. He still didn’t know whether he knew anyone who was in the synagogue, but said he spent the day texting friends in the neighborhood. “As of right now, I don’t know,” Nutini said. But in a tight-knit community like Squirrel Hill, “I guarantee we’ll know somebody who knows somebody.” Jonathan Nadle, 53, of the Beechview neighborhood, said he had gone to donate blood earlier in the day, but so many people had shown up that the clinic had a two-hour wait. He said he’d go back tomorrow, and attended Saturday’s vigil instead. “You want to do something because you feel kind of helpless,” he said. Stuart Hoffman, 69, of Fox Chapel said he grew up going to the synagogue. “Squirrel Hill is the beating heart of the Jewish community of Pittsburgh,” he said. “It’s a wound to the heart.” Earlier in the day, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf called the shooting an "absolute tragedy." "We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life," Wolf said. "But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way." The banner image on the Gab account with Bowers’ name featured the number “1488,” a reference to the “14 words” embraced by white nationalists — commonly known as “we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children” — along with 88, which is numerical code for HH, or “Heil Hitler.” A spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremists, said, however, that the suspect “was not on our radar” before the attack. The shooting is likely to draw attention to Gab, a service that has repeatedly drawn controversy over the last year for its willingness to allow white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have been banned from more mainstream platforms such as Twitter. After the shooting, the payment processing service PayPal cut off its relationship with the social media site. Gab said in a statement that it was “saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh,” and said it has a “zero tolerance policy” for terrorism and violence on the service. The service, which has often been criticized for hosting far-right users, also preemptively defended itself from another expected wave of public criticism after the shooting. “We refused to be defined by the media’s narratives about Gab and our community,” saying the service’s mission is “to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people.” Gab said it took “proactive action” to “immediately” contact law enforcement, including the FBI, and that “we are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see that justice is served.” Wire reported from Pittsburgh and Pearce from Los Angeles.

"These are my babies, my life, my family. I can't do that. I can't sell them," Newsom told reporters during a recent bus tour. He has said he'll make decisions on how he'll balance business and government work a...

---split---14.0---split---https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/27/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-leaves-multiple-casualties/---split---A gunman shouting "all Jews must die" burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue during a circumcision ceremony on Saturday, shooting dead 11 people. Robert Bowers, 46, wielding an arsenal that included a semi-automatic rifle and three handguns, also left six others wounded, including four police officers, during the 20 minute attack. The shooting happened at the Tree of Life Congregation in a leafy suburb in the heart of its Jewish community in Pennsylvania. About 100 people were in the synagogue at the time. It was not known if the baby being circumcised, during a ceremony known as a bris, was harmed. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital after being shot several times by police, was charged late on Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offences. The suspect, who had no apparent criminal record, had left a trail of vile white supremacist comments and anti-Semitic abuse on social media, including sharing posts denying the Holocaust. An hour before the attack he wrote on the Gab social media forum that Jewish "invaders" were "killing our people". He wrote: "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Police officers describing the scene over a scanner said the gunman gave himself up after being injured. “All these Jews have to die,” he said again as he crawled towards them. President Donald Trump was quick to insist that tougher gun laws would have made little difference but the latest attack will also fuel fears that religious and race hate is on the rise during a fraught period of divisive politics. Mr Trump said he would travel to Pittsburgh in the wake of the shooting. "This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us," Mr Trump told supporters at an election rally in Illinois where he began by addressing the attack at length - drawing loud cheers as he vowed to fully enforce the death penalty for such crimes. "We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate." ...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate. His daughter Ivanka, a convert to Judaism, declared: "America is stronger than the acts of a depraved bigot and anti-Semite." Stephen Weiss, who was in a service at the synagogue at the time, described how members of the congregation fled and hid in the basement. “It sounded like a loud crash in the hallway,” he said, describing rapid gunfire that sounded like an automatic weapon. Mr Weiss told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that when he got to the basement he found other members of the congregation also hiding there. Officers said the gunman was armed with an AR-15 rifle and a Glock handgun. Wendell Hissrich, the public safety director for Pittsburgh, said detectives were sifting the site for evidence. “It’s a very horrific crime scene. It’s one of the worst I’ve seen – and I’ve been on plane crashes,” he told a news conference. A user with the name Bowers was active on Gab, a social media platform popular with free speech advocates and white supremacists. The user shared memes spread by Holocaust deniers, questioning the Jewish death toll in Nazi Germany, and criticised Mr Trump for failing to tackle an “infestation” of Jews. Gab deactivated the account soon after the shooting. The cover photo for his account featured a neo-Nazi symbol, and his recent posts included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews during World War II. The tree-lined residential neighbourhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, is the hub of the city’s Jewish community. Its imposing concrete facade is punctuated by rows of swirling, modern stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God's law, the “life cycle” and “how human-beings should care for the earth and one another,” according to its website. Three Jewish congregations meet there and all three were holding services on Saturday morning between 9:45am and noon, with about 100 people in the building. A class usually held on the third floor had been cancelled, the synagogue said. Michael Eisenberg, former president of the synagogue, told KDKA that police were normally only present at the synagogue for security on high holidays. "On a day like today, the door is open, it’s a religious service, you can walk in and out," he said, adding that there had been no threats reported. The attack comes after months of warnings by Jewish groups that anti-Semitic attacks were on the increase at a time of heightened racial and religious intolerance. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported earlier this year that anti-Semitic incidents surged more than 50% in 2017, to almost 2000 cases, the biggest increase since they began collecting data. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL, said: “We are devastated. Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community." The ADL said it believes the Pittsburgh shooting to be the deadliest such attack in US history. Mr Trump said earlier he was monitoring events as the unfolded. He later told reporters that the problem was not gun laws but that the outcome would have been different if the synagogue had armed guards. “They didn't have any protection,” he said as he left Washington for a campaign event. Jewish sites have been targets of several shooting in recent years A neo-Nazi gunman shot dead three people at a Jewish Community Centre and a retirement community in Kansas City in 2014. A police officer was killed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC in 2009. In 1994, a white supremacist fired 10 shots into the Temple Beth Israel in Eugene, Oregon, although no one was hurt. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said on Saturday he was “heartbroken”. “The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh, we stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality and we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded,” he said. Thousands of people, some holding candles, gathered for a vigil in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood on Saturday night in honour of the victims, whose names were not immediately released. A chant of "vote, vote, vote" broke out during the emotional gathering. Some attendees blamed the shooting on the nation's political climate, and said they took little solace in the planned visit by Trump. Mr Trump condemning the synagogue shooting, saying "there must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America." He was speaking at a Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis. Mr Trump called the attack a "wicked act of mass murder" that "is pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable." He says the nation and the word are "shocked and stunned" by grief and is calling on the country to come together. Mr Trump has at times been accused by critics of failing to adequately condemn hate, such as when he blamed "both sides" for the violence at a Charlottesville white supremacist rally. He says that anti-Semitism "must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears" A city official says 11 people were killed, and six injured. FBI agent Bob Jones says it is believed the gunman was acting alone, and he was not previously known to police. An archive of Bower's posts since he joined the Gab social media site in January appeared to show an angry, anti-Semitic man who shared messages such as: "Daily Reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person." About a month ago he posted pictures showing what appeared to the results of his target practice at a shooting range, and a collection of three handguns that he called his "glock family." Bowers, who is a registered voter with "no affiliation" in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, took aim in one post at US President Donald Trump, accusing him of being a "globalist" who did nothing to stop the "infestation" of the United States by Jews. "For the record, I did not vote for him nor have I owned, worn or even touched a MAGA hat," he wrote. Mr Trump says "a lot of people" were killed in the shooting and it "looks definitely like it's an anti-Semitic crime." Mr Trump, speaking at an airport in Indianapolis, saidthat what "happened today is a horrible, horrible thing." He said the FBI is now involved and there were "a lot of people killed" and "a lot of people very badly wounded." He also says the crime scene is one of the worst many professionals have seen. People had gathered for the ceremony. It is not known if the gunman knew it was taking place. It was also not clear if the baby was harmed. Mr Trump called for the death penalty. He said: "I think one thing we should do is we would stiffen up our laws with guns with the death penalty. "When people do this they should get the death penalty." Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America.  The president has been speaking about the shooting while he is at Andrews Air Force Base. He said it was certainly an option for synagogues, and churches, to have armed guards Mr Trump called the shooting "devastating". He added: "It's a 'terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country." Michael Eisenberg, former President of the Tree of Life, told KDKA there would have been about 100 people in the building at the time of the shooting. He said: "At 9:45 there were three simultaneous congregations’ services that were being held. "In the main part of the building, The Tree of Life has a service that has about 40 people in it. "Just below that there is a basement area where New Life congregation would have been having their Shabbat service. There would have been 30-40 people. "Just adjacent to Tree of Light’s service area, a congregation was in the rabbi study room and they would have had approximately 15 people in there." Stephen Weiss, who was in a service at the synagogue at the time, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "It sounded like a loud crash in the hallway." He described rapid gunfire that sounded like an automatic weapon. Mr Weiss said he ran to the basement and found other members of the congregation also hiding there. He said services are held between 9.45am and noon. #BreakingNews Reports of an active shooter in a synagogue in Squirrel Hill.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.

They reveal a community divided over how to move past the tragedy and heal.

(Photo: Monica Rhor) SANTA FE, Texas – As dusk settled on a hot, humid October evening, dozens of families lined up along a darkening country road, waiting for the Santa Fe High School homecoming parade to pass. They camped on folding chairs and the backs of pickup trucks, in the parking lots of dollar stores and auto repair shops. The floats arrived awash in glitter, garland and the school colors of green and gold. Kids tossed candy and beads from flatbeds. Spectators hooted and hollered at the Santa Fe Indians football team and the high-stepping Tribal Belle dance squad. But many also thought back to May 18, when a 17-year-old gunman opened fire in the high school. They thought of the art rooms and hallways where 10 people were killed and 13 injured. Of the window shattered by bullets, repaired just the day before. Of the victims whose names were inscribed on T-shirts. Rosie Stone, who marched the 3-mile route handing out crayons and markers, thought of her son, Chris, whose photo was in the center of a mum corsage pinned close to her heart. He was one of two football players who died in the shooting – and this should have been his senior homecoming. Like so much of what happens these days in this rural Texas town, this year’s parade was suffused with sorrow – reminders that the pain is still raw, the losses still fresh and life is not as it once was. The phrase “Santa Fe Strong” was everywhere. On banners in front of businesses. On the windows of the high school. On the scoreboard at the school stadium, where the procession ended with a community pep rally. Inside the stadium, above a row of posters featuring the varsity roster, a picture of Chris Stone, smiling in his #54 jersey, was framed against the ebony backdrop of the night sky. A few feet away, as the pep rally kicked off, an onlooker leaned on a chain-link fence to watch the high school cheerleaders on the brightly-lit stadium field. On her “Santa Fe Strong” shirt were the words to the 23rd Psalm: “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.” With the May 18 shooting, Santa Fe became part of a grim roll call: Parkland. Sutherland Springs. Las Vegas. Orlando. Sandy Hook. Aurora. Columbine. Each community thrown into the national consciousness by unspeakable tragedy, then left to grapple with grief and anger long after the public attention has dimmed. In Santa Fe, a close-knit town of 13,000 that tumbles over 17 square miles of fast-food joints, former pasture and marshland, everyone was touched, in some way, by the shooting – and everyone seemed moved to help. In the days immediately after, there were public vigils and prayer services, human barricades to shield the families and students from the media onslaught, barbecue dinners and bake sales to raise money for victims. Then, just as with a family in mourning, schisms began to emerge. School board meetings grew heated as parents and board members lobbed criticism at each other. Facebook groups were created, then disbanded as residents argued about metal detectors and school safety. A few voices called for gun control, but many more maintained that guns were not to blame. It was as Christine Hunschofsky, the mayor of Parkland, Florida, had warned Santa Fe Mayor Jason Tabor. At first, the entire community will come together, she said, repeating what the mother of a boy killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, had told her. "Then a tsunami will hit your city, and people will become divided over everything.” Five months after a school shooting, the Santa Fe High School homecoming parade ends with a community pep rally. (Photo: Monica Rhor)  On bad days – rainy days and Fridays are always bad – Rosie Stone doesn’t come out of her room. She shuts herself off from the world and burrows into her memories. Her last words to her son, Chris, just after a pizza dinner, when she tousled the 17-year-old’s hair, wished him good night and said “I love you.” His footsteps the next morning, as he walked to the front door and off to Santa Fe High School. The call from Chris’ friend a short while later. “Mama Stone,” he said. “You better get to the school. They’re saying Chris has been shot.” It would be 10 hours before Rosie Stone was told what happened to her son. Just as first period was starting, a teenager armed with a shotgun and .38 revolver had burst into the art rooms of the town’s only high school. He fired into two supply closets where several students, including Isabelle Laymance and Chris, were hiding, according to police and witness accounts. Isabelle, then a freshman, survived. Chris, who held the closet door shut to keep the shooter from entering, and four others did not. Three girls, among them Kimberly Vaughan, died in the classrooms. Two teachers were killed as they ushered children to safety. Thirteen people, including substitute teacher Flo Rice, were wounded. Dozens of others escaped the gunfire but witnessed the carnage. Rosie Stone, whose son Chris was killed in the Santa Fe school shooting, holds an urn containing some of his ashes. A locket has his junior prom pictures. (Photo: Monica Rhor) Two months after the shooting, Rosie Stone visited the spot where her son was killed. She stood there for a long time, thinking about Chris’ last moments, about the friend who held his hand as he took his last breath. That Chris, who would have turned 18 on Oct. 19, died a hero was not a surprise. He was the boy who stood up to bullies, who flashed a welcoming smile at classmates other students overlooked. “An awesome kid,” his mother says through tears. She holds on to that. Just as she clasps tight to a palm-sized blue urn containing some of his ashes, which she carries in her purse. (A larger one is at home). Just as she cherishes a present from his girlfriend – a silver locket with pictures from junior prom. Just as she keeps his room intact, down to the dirty plate and cup he left there. And as she strives to live up to one of his favorite sayings: “God’s plan.” It was Chris’s response when anything happened – good or bad. “I’m not the same person I was five months ago,” Rosie Stone said. “I will never be the same person I was.” She is trying to funnel her anguish into activism. She started a service organization called CCC – Chris Courage Change – in her son’s memory. The mom who had never before been to a Santa Fe school board meeting has become a fiery presence there, pushing for answers: Why have school officials discounted reports of bullying? Why was the shooter allowed to wear a trench coat that was against dress code? How can the superintendent claim that the nine metal detectors, bullet-resistant glass and panic buttons added after the shooting make the high school the “safest school in the nation”? Her questions have brought criticism and even accusations of bullying from board members, but she persists. In two years, she plans to run for a seat on the board. Still, Rosie Stone is not the fighter she once was. She is tired – not yet able to go back to work as a medical assistant in an OB-GYN office and leaning on her 19-year-old daughter, Mercedez, who barely leaves her side. Someday, she just sits in her car and screams “Why?” Comfort comes in small doses – in the embraces of the varsity football players that felt like “Chris sent hugs,” in monthly dinners with the families of other Santa Fe victims, and in getting to know families from Parkland and other mass shootings, with whom they exchange messages on social media, gather at conferences about trauma, and plan to spend holidays. “They are our family now,” Mercedez said, “because they are the only ones who understand.” About 8 miles outside Santa Fe, Rhonda Hart sat at her kitchen table with her son. As Tyler finished a home-school lesson, Hart wrote messages in bright marker on a pile of postcards, urging voters to turn out for Democratic candidates in the Nov. 6 election. Since her 14-year-old daughter, Kimberly Vaughan, became the youngest victim of the Santa Fe shooting, Hart’s life has centered on her son and her political advocacy – her way of wrangling the sadness. Hart, then working as a Santa Fe school bus driver, had just dropped students off at the high school when she saw her daughter for the last time. As Kim walked by, her mother called out “I love you!” and flashed the word “love” in sign language – long their family’s shorthand. It was 6:45 a.m. – about 45 minutes before the shooting began, and long hours before the Santa Fe police chaplain informed her that Kim, a Girl Scout and Harry Potter fan, had been “the victim of gun violence.” A month later, Hart moved out of Santa Fe. She couldn’t bear walking past her daughter’s empty room or seeing banners meant to honor the victims. She has not been able to sort through Kim’s belongings, which were stored in boxes by a moving company that specializes in clients in the throes of grief. She has cut herself off from Santa Fe, a conservative community where guns and hunting are part of the culture. Here, her vocal calls for gun control and opposition to the NRA have been met with hostility and, at times, open insults. She no longer works as a school bus driver and pulled her sixth-grade son out of the school district. Rhonda Hart, whose daughter Kimberly Vaughan was killed in the Santa Fe High School Shooting, works at her kitchen table with her son, Tyler. (Photo: Monica Rhor) On the night of the homecoming parade, Hart attended a rally for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, where she held up a sign calling for gun control – not the first time she has confronted him or the first time her actions stirred a storm of social media criticism. One Santa Fe school board member tried to dismiss Hart, a U.S. Army veteran, by questioning her military status. But she has found solidarity. She checks in regularly with three of the other mothers who lost children in Santa Fe. No politics, just concern: “Did you cry in the closet last night? How’s your other kid?” “Nobody asked to be in this thing and it's got a lifetime membership,” said Hart, who wears Kim’s charm bracelet and a pendant with the sign language symbol for love. “It’s the shittiest fan club I’ve ever been in.” She discovered a kinship with families from Parkland who share her determination to pass gun reform legislation. At a recent meeting, one father recited the rituals that now accompany school shootings: the gathering of families into cramped rooms as they wait, the delivery of pizza, the white crosses sprouting up as memorials, the foundations started by disconsolate parents. (The one in Kim’s name will be called “Always Choose Love.”) “Tick, tick, tick,” Hart said, as if marking off a checklist. “It’s an obscene thing.” Flo Rice once loved the homecoming parade, the kind of small-town tradition that binds a community together. She loved strolling alongside her two daughters as they rode in floats. That was before. Before five bullets tore into both of her legs. Before she saw her friend and fellow substitute teacher, Ann Perkins, gunned down next to her as they rushed through a high school hallway. Now, she has an 18-inch titanium rod doctors used to repair her broken left leg. Splintered nerve endings, which send bolts of pain at the slightest touch, in her right leg. PTSD that makes her jump at the sound of rattling dishes and steer away from public spaces. The 2018 Santa Fe substitute of the year says she will never go back to teaching. The once 20-mile-a-week runner, who spent months in a hospital and in a wheelchair, now leans on a cane to walk. And this year, while her husband, Scot, marched with Rosie Stone in the parade, Flo Rice stayed home – far from the tumult that could set off her anxiety. Substitute teacher Flo Rice, one of 13 people injured in the Santa Fe High School shooting, is still recovering physically and emotionally. (Photo: Monica Rhor) For a long time, Rice said, she was reluctant to tell her story, concerned about the families whose heartache seems to cut so much sharper. Her survivor’s guilt amplified by the random nature of the gunfire. Why, she asked herself, had she lived while Perkins died? Other questions gnawed at her, too. Did parents know that substitute teachers didn’t have the tools to save lives in an emergency? That they were not allowed to carry keys or badges? That they did not receive the same active shooter training as full-time teachers? If God’s grace saved her that day, as Rice wholly believes, it had to be for a purpose. Changing the protocols for substitute teacher training, she has decided, is that mission. Like Rosie Stone, Rice and her husband have taken their crusade to the school board. In late July, speaking haltingly for the first time in public, she asked for equal training for substitutes. Two months later, her voice strong, clear and full of indignation, Rice demanded acknowledgment of the students whom school board officials had never officially thanked. The survivors who, she told the board, fought just to stay alive. “They pried open locked doors to gain an escape route and ran like hell for help. … Some pushed others out of the line of fire. Friends helped each other, shot and bleeding, scale a brick wall, while others used their clothes to cover and conceal the injured.” “These are not the victims of May 18,” she said. “These are our heroes.” Rice called on the board to shake the hands of some of the survivors, just as they greet students presented for school achievements and extracurricular awards. The board demurred. “Your time is up, ma’am.” “You can’t shake their hands?” Rice asked, shaking and incredulous. “You shook all the other children’s hands and you can’t shake theirs?” “They’ve never been recognized,” snapped Scot Rice, who hovered by his wife. “That’s the problem.” Isabelle Laymance’s mom understands that everyone impacted by the shooting must process what happened in their own time, their own way. She understands the frustration with the school board, the search for someone to blame, the calls for accountability, the drive for change. She knows the shooting left many ripples: The 10 families who lost a loved one. The 13 injured. The 60 students who were in the two art rooms. The 373 students and 15 adults who have received counseling services at the school since August. The kids who wrestle with late-night panic attacks. Isabelle's dad, who still can't talk about that day without crying. The entire Santa Fe community. But Deedra Van Ness says there is only one path through the darkness. For Isabelle’s sake, she said, she must “choose grace.” She trusts that the school will keep her child safe. She promotes counseling sessions at the Santa Fe Resiliency Center. She applauds efforts to help the community heal: the therapeutic garden behind City Hall, the volunteers who furnished art and music therapy rooms at the high school, the strangers around the country who sent anxiety blankets and stress-relief dolls, the Snapchat support group Isabelle started just after the shooting. The recently dedicated memorial at Maranatha Christian Center where, planted in a semicircle, are 10 white crosses. Each one bears the name of a victim. Van Ness and Isabelle also distribute toys in parks and playgrounds as part of #Honor10, an campaign to remember the victims by doing random acts of kindness. A memorial to the 10 victims of the Santa Fe High School shooting stands outside a church. (Photo: Monica Rhor) It’s not easy to stay positive. “My daughter says she died that day,” Van Ness said. “It just guts me.” On May 18, Isabelle called her mother from the art room closet as she and other students hid from the shooter, listening to the gunfire and hearing his taunts. Then the 15-year-old hung up. She called police three times and passed her phone to classmates, so they could contact their families. The whole time, she later told her mother, the gunman was shooting into the closet. It took more than 40 minutes for police to reach the art rooms and lead the survivors to safety. There was blood and bodies everywhere, she later told her mom. One of the dead was her cousin, Angelique Ramirez. Five months later, Isabelle relives the day in flashbacks and bad dreams. She flinches at the sound of the doorbell, at water pelting against the shower tile, at ringing cellphones. She could not face the homecoming parade, with its crowds and clamor. She struggles to get through an entire school day. In the first few weeks of this school year, Van Ness would get regular, frantic texts from her daughter: “I can't catch my breath.” First period, when the shooting took place, was agony. The school adjusted Isabelle’s schedule, allowing the 10th-grader to come in later, which seems to have helped. On the day of the homecoming game, Van Ness posted a photo on Facebook of a grinning Isabelle dressed in green and gold, a mum corsage around her thigh. The caption read, “Baby girl showing some school spirit this morning.” Down the road, after Isabelle has worked through the fears and the trauma, her mother hopes she will be able to forgive. Not the actions, not the monster who was indicted on capital murder and assault charges and is being held in Galveston County Jail while awaiting trial. But the teenage shooter Van Ness calls a “broken boy.” Her daughter is not ready yet. But perhaps, some day. Follow Monica Rhor on Twitter: @monicarhor

Updated at 12:14 a.m. ET on Sunday Federal prosecutors have charged Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old suspected gunman who carried out a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, with 29 counts in the deaths of 11 people, The Associated Press reports. "Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe," Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, according to the AP, describing the massacre as a "terrible and unspeakable act of hate." Officials in Pittsburgh reported 11 people, none of them children, were killed in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in what is being investigated as a hate crime. The federal charges issued to Bowers Saturday night include hate crimes and weapons offenses. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters six people were injured in the attack. Four police officers were among the injured. First responders surround the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a shooter opened fire Saturday morning. Gene J. Puskar/AP hide caption First responders surround the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a shooter opened fire Saturday morning. Bowers surrendered to the police inside the synagogue and was taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds but officials say he's in fair condition. His voice breaking, Hissrich said it was a "very horrific crime scene." "It's one of the worst that I've seen and I've been on some plane crashes," Hissrich said. "It's very bad." In a statement, the Anti-Defamation League called the shooting one of the deadliest attacks on the Jewish community in the history of the United States. Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Pittsburgh office, said that the investigation is still in the early stages, but that agents plan to look at everything in the suspect's life, including his social media activity and movements in the last few days.

Jones said authorities do not believe the suspect was known to law enforcement before the attack. Reports of a shooting began at about 9:54 a.m., just nine minutes after a Saturday service was scheduled to begin at the synagogue. Officers were dispatched to the scene at 9:55 a.m., according to law enforcement officials. Bowers was said to have been in the synagogue for about 20 minutes with an assault-style rifle and three handguns. As Bowers was exiting the synagogue, a Pittsburgh police officer engaged with him. The officer was subsequently wounded, and as he withdrew, the suspect went back into the synagogue in order to hide from a SWAT team that was moving toward the scene, according to officials. Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert praised the bravery of the officers who arrived on the scene. "Watching those officers run into the danger to remove people and get them to safety was unbelievable," Schubert said.

On his way to Air Force One on Saturday afternoon, President Trump addressed the shooting, remarking that if there were an armed guard inside the temple, the shooter might have been stopped. He also suggested that bringing "the death penalty into vogue" would help deter such attacks. Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, he said of the lack of an armed guard: "They didn't have any protection. They had a maniac walk in, and they didn't have any protection." He added: "And, that is just so sad to see. So sad to see. The results could have been much better." The president said the nation should "stiffen up laws in terms of the death penalty" in order to prevent such shootings from happening in the future. "I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue," Trump said.

"Anyone that does something like this to innocent people that are in temple or church, we've had so many incidents with churches ... They should really suffer the ultimate price, they should really pay the ultimate price. I've felt that way for a long time." Pennsylvania is one of 31 states where capital punishment remains legal, but it has been almost 20 years since the state has carried out an execution. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the shooting "reprehensible and utterly repugnant." Sessions said the Justice Department "will file hate crimes and other criminal charges against the defendant, including charges that could lead to the death penalty." Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America. Upon arriving at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, Trump again addressed the shooting in speech, saying it was "hard to believe" and "frankly something that is unimaginable." "This was an anti-Semitic act," Trump said. "You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don't seem to learn from the past." Vice President Pence commended law enforcement officers for their swift response. "There is no place in America for violence or anti-Semitism and this evil must end," Pence said at an event in Las Vegas.

He echoed Trump, agreeing that anyone who opens fire on worshippers should pay the ultimate price. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that he was "heartbroken and appalled" by the shooting. "The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded," Netanyahu said. Neighbors around the corner from the site of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue embrace one another.

According to the Tree of Life website, Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers usually leads its Saturday service. In July, Myers wrote an essay for the synagogue's website titled "We Deserve Better," which focused on several issues, including gun control. Myers wrote: "Despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that it would fade away in time. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the mid-term elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume. I shouldn't have to include in my daily morning prayers that God should watch over my wife and daughter, both teachers, and keep them safe. Where are our leaders?" The 11 victims killed in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning are part of the 289 people who have died so far as a result of a mass shooting in 2018, Vox reports. (The outlet cites data from the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as incidents in which at least four people, not including the shooter, are shot but not necessarily killed.)
