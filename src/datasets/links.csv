---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senate-rules-panel-advance-plan-cut-debate-time-trump-nominees-next-week---split---Senate Rules and Administration Chairman Roy Blunt is expected to bring up the rules change plan next week. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Senate Republicans are moving ahead with an effort to effectively change the rules, reducing the amount of debate time allowed on many lower-level nominations by President Donald Trump. The resolution, which has been championed by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., was being reintroduced Wednesday. It’s expected to be marked up by the Senate Rules and Administration Committee next week, according to a person familiar with the scheduling. During the last Congress, Lankford sought to revive and make a permanent standing order on reduced debate time that was in effect in 2013 and 2014. That temporary deal was bipartisan. It cut the time for post-cloture debate to eight hours for most executive branch posts, as well as just two hours for nominees to be district judges. Under the new resolution’s standing order, debate time for district judges and covered executive branch positions would be two hours, equally divided between the two parties — significantly speeding up the process. Even nominations that are not covered could be sped up, with the longer post-cloture debate time being equally divided between Republicans and Democrats. Lankford said in a recent interview that he hoped at least some of the Democratic senators who are running for president in 2020 might be convinced to sign on, in an attempt to ease the burden of the confirmation process for their own nominees. Republicans have continually expressed frustration about the pace of processing the more routine nominations that Trump sent to Capitol Hill. “It only takes one senator to request a cloture vote, and so it’s hard to imagine that there wouldn’t be at least one Republican that would look at each of those different nominees that come up, after what was done for four years to a Republican president,” Lankford said. One of those Democratic senators is Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who currently serves as ranking member on the Rules panel. She is scheduled to announce her 2020 plans on Sunday. Sen. Roy Blunt, the chairman of the Rules and Administration panel, has joined Lankford in introducing the new resolution. “Over and over again, Senate Democrats have demanded cloture votes only to spend little to no time debating the nominees, many of whom were ultimately confirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support. This has been nothing more than obstruction for the sake of obstruction and it is outrageous,” the Missouri Republican said in a statement. “This resolution will get the Senate back to functioning as it should under the Constitution — in its role of advice and consent.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/confirmation-hearing-involve-dueling-mortgage-plans---split---Ranking member Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, left, and Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., attend a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Dirksen Building titled “Oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,” on December 11, 2018. Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The Trump administration’s still undisclosed plans to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be a focus of upcoming confirmation hearings for the nominee of the federal agency overseeing the two government sponsored enterprises. Democrats such as Senate Banking ranking member Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, have said they’re concerned about the suitability of Mark Calabria, the nominee to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The committee hasn’t said when it will hold a hearing on Calabria’s nomination. “He comes out of the far right of the Republican Party,” Brown said on Tuesday. “They want to privatize everything, and my concern is: what happens to the 30-year mortgage if they get their way?” The Senate Banking hearing could show the likely direction of efforts to overhaul agencies that are huge players in the national mortgage market. Not only could Calabria reveal administration thinking, he would be doing so in front of Senate Banking Chairman Michael D. Crapo, who last week released his own outline. Now chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, Calabria once did research at the libertarian Cato Institute, where he said government-backed mortgages have done little to ensure the viability of 30-year fixed rate mortgages or boost homeownership rates that were no higher than they were before Fannie and Freddie grew to guarantee and securitize nearly half of all mortgages originated in the U.S. “He’s the only one that believes that, though,” Brown said. The government put Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship in 2008 in the wake of the housing market crash, spending $190 billion in the rescue. The firms have since returned about $292 billion to the Treasury in profit sweeps, but they remain on the hook for the original capital. Legislative proposals to end the conservatorship have come and gone in the past decade, but none has passed either chamber of Congress. Crapo, R-Idaho, outlined a proposal to privatize the two Government Sponsored Enterprises, requiring them to pay back the government, perhaps at a discount, and then recapitalize the companies so they could operate on their own. His proposal differs from one he made in 2014 primarily in the privatization element. In his 2014 plan, proposed along with Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson, he would have wound them down. The privatization provision makes the plan more palpable to Fannie and Freddie shareholders, but does little to satisfy other constituencies that opposed the 2014 bill. Crucially, the Crapo proposal would preserve government backing for 30-year fixed rate mortgages, a feature that many say is essential to the housing industry. The proposal would convert Fannie and Freddie into private mortgage guarantors competing with other private firms. But the loans they back would be eligible for bundling into mortgage backed securities by Ginnie Mae, a government sponsored enterprise that would have an implicit government guarantee. Crapo’s outline would direct Ginnie Mae to also establish a mortgage insurance fund that the guarantors would pay insurance premiums into. As he did in 2014, Crapo is calling for a 10 basis point annual assessment on all mortgages in the scheme and funnel it to the Housing Trust Fund, the Capital Magnet Fund and a new Market Access Fund, which would replace Fannie and Freddie’s existing affordable housing goals and duty-to-serve requirements. The panel reported the 2014 bill to the full Senate favorably, but no floor vote followed. Jon Tester of Montana and Mark Warner of Virginia are the only two Democrats still on the committee of the six who backed the 2014 bill. Brown, Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who are still on the committee, voted against the 2014 bill. As it did in 2014, the housing industry has cautiously supported Crapo. The Mortgage Bankers Association released a statement calling the outline “a significant sign of his continued commitment to work toward finally ending the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and ensuring a stable and liquid market — with an explicit, paid-for government guarantee — for both single-family and multifamily mortgages.” The National Association of Home Builders described it as an “important step to move the debate forward.” Credit unions applauded the effort, noting that the outline would prohibit guarantors from offering volume-based discounts on the fees they charge. The smaller institutions have called the industry practice of offering better terms for bigger loan packages unfair. The National Association of Federal Credit Unions and the Credit Union National Association were both more tepid in their support back in 2014. Consumer and civil rights advocates are opposed. The Center for Responsible Lending, the NAACP, the National Urban League and a half-dozen other organizations said, “it is disappointing to see a proposal that weakens the regulatory authority over the GSEs and returns the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie and Freddie’s regulator, to the same frail status the regulator was in leading to the housing crash of 2008 that hurt so many hardworking families and significantly contributed to the current lagging rates of Black and Latino homeownership in the country.” Crapo can also expect opposition on his right flank. The Heritage Foundation released a proposal last week rejecting any overhaul that would retain government guarantees and calling for the Trump administration to move without Congress to shrink the footprint of Fannie and Freddie. The proposal echoes Calabria from his time at Cato. Crapo’s outline seems to have flipped Fannie and Freddie’s shareholders to his side. His proposal in 2014, which would have wiped out equity holders, led shares to plunge by nearly a third. The outline he released last week led to a small decline in prices that have more than doubled since Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and acting FHFA director Joseph Otting started talking in recent weeks about moving the GSEs out of conservatorship without Congress. Otting is also the director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. “I’m concerned about the administration’s involvement,” said Brown. “We don’t know what the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is doing.” Brown said Democrats might dig in their heels further if the administration tries to spur Congress to act by threatening to go it alone. “We hear there’s a plan — an administration plan — and we want to see it before we got into this [Crapo’s proposal], so we can go in with eyes wide open,” Brown added. Brown, along with House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., asked Otting in a letter to provide more details on the administration’s ideas for Fannie and Freddie. In response, Otting only provided a cursory description of the FHFA and its statutory duties. Crapo told CQ that he wants to work with the administration. “I believe that the administration, generally at the leadership level, would like to move ahead with Congress and work jointly, and that’s what I think is the best outcome,” Crapo said. “If Congress once again gets stuck, I could see the administration seeing if they could do some of the kinds of preparatory work for a congressional solution.” The administration may ultimately decide against moving forward with any plan that could rattle an already shaky housing market just before the 2020 elections. But Brown doesn’t think that’ll stop them. “Do you read what the White House tweets out every day?” Brown, a potential presidential candidate, said. “It’s closing the government down, it’s a tax bill that screws the middle class, it’s regulations that weaken protections for workers — So, why would housing be any different?” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/china-threat-looms-sver-senate-5g-hearing---split---Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, new Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Senators from both parties on Wednesday signaled support for building a fifth-generation wireless network that could enable innovation in telecom, agriculture, and health care sectors but raised concerns that China is already on its way to establishing dominance over the technology. At the year’s first hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, new Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said nationwide 5G implementation could propel the United States “into the fourth industrial revolution,” by creating millions of new jobs and enhancing transportation and agricultural systems through enhanced connectivity. But if China wins the “race to 5G,” Wicker said, it could “forever reduce” the status of the United States as a global leader in technology. Deliberations over the build-out of a 5G network in the United States have been dominated by the specter of national security threats posed by Chinese telecom companies including Huawei and ZTE, which build many of the components in wireless networks worldwide and have been accused of seeking to steal technology and spy on Americans by U.S. intelligence agencies. ICYMI: FBI Director: Trump Didn’t Seek Advice Before Tweeting on ZTE Michael Wessel, a commissioner with the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told the committee that China is “already doing everything it can legally and illegally” to gain an advantage over 5G implementation. “China wants to dominate 5G and they’re ready to pour $400 billion into its development,” Wessel said. “We have no comparable plans in the U.S.” President Donald Trump has sought to pressure China over its technology policies during ongoing trade negotiations and has played hardball with Huawei and ZTE, banning the use of their technology in government equipment. And in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Trump backed investing in “the cutting edge industries of the future.” Industry stakeholders who testified on Wednesday offered a slew of attractive innovations they said could be more easily implemented with the help of 5G, including safer school buses and precision agriculture tools that could boost or reduce crop yields according to market demand. Wicker discussed a pilot program in Mississippi that brings telehealth services to rural patients. Rural communities, in particular, stand to gain from 5G, said Steve Berry, president of Competitive Carriers Association, which represents small and medium-sized internet service providers. “The race to 5G will not be won if rural America is left behind,” said Berry. “We must ensure the connectivity gap is bridged.” When Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., asked why some service providers continue to use Chinese components in their networks despite the risks, Berry said the lower cost of Chinese equipment can be a draw for smaller companies fighting to remain competitive. But he said industry leaders share the government's national security concerns. “Our members want to do the right thing,” he said.

After weeks of bitter drama and a cancellation, President Donald Trump's State of the Union is finally here. Meanwhile, the clock's ticking for Congress to prevent another shutdown by Feb. 15. It’s Ashley Shaffer, here to give you a quick look at everything to know for tonight’s big speech (plus other news, of course). But first, whoa: A mountain lion in Colorado attacked a man from behind and bit him in the face before he suffocated the lion in self-defense. 😲 Hours before the SOTU, Trump floated the idea of a “human wall” on the border if Democrats refuse to fund his, uh, non-human wall. "We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall, this would be a non-event," Trump tweeted Tuesday. The Pentagon said over the weekend it would deploy around 3,750 additional U.S. forces to the southwest border, raising the number of troops there to about 4,350. You can tune in to watch the State of the Union now, on all the major networks. We have a livestream of the speech on our site and social, too. Before you grab your popcorn, here’s a (short) list of what you should look for during Trump’s speech:   Newly released footage shows chaos after a white Chicago police officer shot an African-American security guard outside a nightclub in November. Security guard Jemel Roberson, licensed to carry a firearm, was subduing an alleged gunman outside a bar when officer Ian Covey arrived and shot Roberson to death.

Trump Jr. intended to pay a visit to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the Capitol before his father’s State of the Union address. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Donald Trump Jr. entered Statuary Hall for his father’s State of the Union address on Tuesday headed for a friendly office but ended up in enemy territory. The president’s son intended to pay a visit to the office of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy but was headed to that of Speaker Nancy Pelosi before he reversed course. Heard on the Hill suspects that route was out of habit for Trump Jr., given that Paul Ryan inhabited that office when Republicans controlled the House. Democrats took over control of the House in January after winning more seats in the 2018 midterm elections. It’s common for party leadership to have meetings with family members, political figures and State of the Union guests ahead of the address.

She knows. And she knows that you know. And frankly she’s disappointed that you thought this would work. But here’s a clap,” wrote the younger Pelosi. #waybackwednesday - oh yes that clap took me back to the teen years. She knows. And she knows that you know. And frankly she’s disappointed that you thought this would work. But here’s a clap. #youtriedit pic.twitter.com/vUCX2uAUvv To Christine Pelosi’s point, this reporter has to ask: What child of a mother who has seen it all over the years hasn’t been the recipient of that damning smirk? Christine Pelosi is one of the Speaker’s five children and tweeted often throughout the State of the Union. The seemingly sarcastic clap that led to a massive viral movement came about during the SOTU when Trump raised a call for unity, despite his rhetoric and actions prior to this speech suggesting otherwise. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,” Trump said in his address. The smirk and literal clap-back were immediately meme-ified and even Photoshopped, with one tweet coining the phrase “sarcasm energy.” You could power Cleveland for weeks on this pure sarcasm energy pic.twitter.com/ZXK2rHEe1V It seems Pelosi’s “sarcasm energy” has been around for decades and, if the SOTU was any indication, it’s only getting stronger with time.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/hispanic-caucus-members-to-homeland-security-conferees-no-more-money-for-immigrant-detention-or-a-wall---split---Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, pictured with his son, as House members were sworn in on the first day of the 116th Congress on Jan. 3, led a letter to the Homeland Security appropriations conference urging them not to approve any more money for immigration detention or a wall. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro and 20 members of his caucus sent a letter to the Homeland Security conferees urging them not to appropriate any more money for immigrant detention or a border wall. “We urge you to oppose increases in funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purposes of immigration detention, Trump’s deportation force, the border wall — and ensure that certain types of detention are not expanded or replaced in ways that conflict with the goal of reducing detention overall.” The letter, addressed to all 17 appropriators on the Homeland Security conference committee and sent Tuesday, was signed by more than half of the 38-member Hispanic Caucus, including the group’s top leaders and the No. 4 House Democrat, Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján. Democratic leaders have often deferred to Hispanic Caucus members to take the lead on immigration issues. Their opposition to anything the conference committee comes up with could spell trouble for its ability to pass the House. However, the caucus is well represented in the conference negotiations. Half of the six House Democratic conferees, Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard and Pete Aguilar of California and Henry Cuellar of Texas, are in the Hispanic Caucus. Roybal-Allard, Aguilar and Cuellar did not sign the letter, likely because it was addressed to them. Plus the conferees have been trying to keep an open mind during the negotiations. However, they all have previously made arguments similar to the ones the CHC made in its letter. In addition to no further money for detention, the letter calls for an “increase transparency, accountability, and oversight of ICE and CBP, including by requiring annual audits of spending in all programs and inspections of all detention facilities whether operated by DHS or its contractors.” They also suggest appropriators should limit those agencies from being able to reprogram funds to build a wall or border barriers, increase detention, or ramp up enforcement. And echoing a letter sent earlier this week by outside privacy advocates, the CHC members urged the appropriators to ensure border technology investments do not infringe on privacy and civil liberties. The Hispanic Caucus members explained the rationale for their request to the conferees as not wanting Congress to further empower President Donald Trump and what they say is his administration’s “anti-immigrant agenda,” which they say he’s been carrying out with congressionally appropriated funds. Since the Department of Homeland Security’s inception in 2003, ICE’s budget has more than doubled and CBP’s has nearly tripled, “unprecedented levels” that have enabled the enabling the administration to use “overly aggressive enforcement” against immigrant and border communities, they said. “Providing DHS with a blank check for more enforcement resources would vindicate President Trump’s so-called ‘crisis’ at our southern border and fortify his out-of-control detention and deportation force,” the caucus members wrote. “At a time when the country is deeply disturbed by the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, we cannot miss this opportunity to rein in the agency chiefly responsible for carrying it out.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/pelosi-trump-investigations-threat---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi shakes hands with President Donald Trump before his State of the Union address on Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Speaker Nancy Pelosi was visibly appalled at much of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, but there was one particular line that seemed to be bugging her the next morning: “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.” “It was a threat. It was an all-out threat,” the California Democrat told reporters Wednesday morning. “The president should not bring threats to the floor of the House,” Pelosi said. “He said he wasn’t going to cooperate unless we didn’t exercise our constitutional responsibility to oversight.” And that’s what it is, she emphasized. “It’s not investigations. It’s oversight.” Watch: Optimistic, hypocritical and long — members sum up State of the Union in 3 words Democrats are willing to work with Trump on matters like lowering prescription drug prices and rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure if he was sincere, the speaker said. But she wasn’t so sure he was. “It’s a speech. It’s a presentation. It’s a performance,” Pelosi said. The speaker also said that her forward reaching applause line that appeared sarcastic and has become a viral internet meme was sincere. Pelosi’s infamous clap came as Trump said, “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.” “It wasn’t sarcastic,” Pelosi said. “Look at what I was applauding. I wanted him to know that was a very welcome message.” Other House Democrats were also appalled at Trump’s comment on investigations. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said if Trump’s comment was intended as a threat, that is “unfortunate.” “He seems to threaten everyone though. It’s a pattern for him,” the Maryland Democrat said. Hoyer said Democrats weren't intimidated by the remark and will continue their oversight efforts. “It's certainly not going to have any impact,” he said. Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Wednesday, “We will not be bullied by the president of the United States. That said, we’re not going to overreach. We’re not going to over-investigate.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---6.0---split---https://play.google.com/?hl=en---split---Over 1 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. • A New York Times bestseller for over a decade • Over 7.4 million copies sold in the U.S. • Translated into 40 languages worldwide “Don Miguel Ruiz’s book is a roadmap to enlightenment and freedom.” — Deepak Chopra, Author, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success “An inspiring book with many great lessons.” — Wayne Dyer, Author, Real Magic “In the tradition of Castaneda, Ruiz distills essential Toltec wisdom, expressing with clarity and impeccability what it means for men and women to live as peaceful warriors in the modern world.” — Dan Millman, Author, Way of the Peaceful Warrior Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie. As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore. With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be. With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, Girl, Wash Your Face shows you how to live with passion and hustle--and how to give yourself grace without giving up. - #1 New York Times Bestseller for 8 years running - Now celebrating its 25th anniversary  Simple ideas, lasting love Falling in love is easy.

Includes the Couple's Personal Profile assessment so you can discover your love language and that of your loved one. The first honest insider’s account of the Trump administration. After standing at Donald Trump’s side on Election Night, Cliff Sims joined him in the West Wing as Special Assistant to the President and Director of White House Message Strategy. He soon found himself pulled into the President’s inner circle as a confidante, an errand boy, an advisor, a punching bag, and a friend. Sometimes all in the same conversation. As a result, Sims gained unprecedented access to the President, sitting in on private meetings with key Congressional officials, world leaders, and top White House advisors. He saw how Trump handled the challenges of the office, and he learned from Trump himself how he saw the world. For five hundred days, Sims also witnessed first-hand the infighting and leaking, the anger, joy, and recriminations. He had a role in some of the President’s biggest successes, and he shared the blame for some of his administration’s worst disasters. He gained key, often surprising insights into the players of the Trump West Wing, from Jared Kushner and John Kelly to Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. He even helped Trump craft his enemies list, knowing who was loyal and who was not. And he took notes. Hundreds of pages of notes. In real-time. Sims stood with the President in the eye of the storm raging around him, and now he tells the story that no one else has written—because no one else could. The story of what it was really like in the West Wing as a member of the President’s team. The story of power and palace intrigue, backstabbing and bold victories, as well as painful moral compromises, occasionally with yourself. Team of Vipers tells the full story, as only a true insider could. *The first novella from Radicalized* Unauthorized Bread is a tale of immigration, the toxicity of economic and technological stratification, and the young and downtrodden fighting against all odds to survive and prosper. “If you thought that there was no reason left for living after the end of the Sorcerer’s Ring series, you were wrong. In RISE OF THE DRAGONS Morgan Rice has come up with what promises to be another brilliant series, immersing us in a fantasy of trolls and dragons, of valor, honor, courage, magic and faith in your destiny. Morgan has managed again to produce a strong set of characters that make us cheer for them on every page.…Recommended for the permanent library of all readers that love a well-written fantasy.” --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos  The #1 Bestseller!  From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes a sweeping new epic fantasy series: RISE OF THE DRAGONS (KINGS AND SORCERERS—Book 1).  Kyra, 15, dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, even though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. As she struggles to understand her special skills, her mysterious inner power, she realizes she is different than the others. But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her to wonder who she really is.  When Kyra comes of age and the local lord comes to take her away, her father wants to wed her off to save her. Kyra, though, refuses, and she journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragon—and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever.  15 year old Alec, meanwhile, sacrifices for his brother, taking his place in the draft, and is carted off to The Flames, a wall of flames a hundred feet high that wards off the army of Trolls to the east. On the far side of the kingdom, Merk, a mercenary striving to leave behind his dark past, quests through the wood to become a Watcher of the Towers and help guard the Sword of Fire, the magical source of the kingdom’s power. But the Trolls want the Sword, too—and they prepare for a massive invasion that could destroy the kingdoms forever.  With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, RISE OF THE DRAGONS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, of ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders.  Book #2 in KINGS AND SORCERERS is now available!  “RISE OF THE DRAGONS succeeds—right from the start…. A superior fantasy…It begins, as it should, with one protagonist's struggles and moves neatly into a wider circle of knights, dragons, magic and monsters, and destiny.…All the trappings of high fantasy are here, from soldiers and battles to confrontations with self….A recommended winner for any who enjoy epic fantasy writing fueled by powerful, believable young adult protagonists.” --Midwest Book Review, D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself "the angriest Black man in America" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind.  An established classic of modern America, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" was hailed by the New York Times as "Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book." Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcom X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared. Of Mice and Men also represents an experiment in form, as Steinbeck described his work, “a kind of playable novel, written in novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. Benedict Cumberbatch reads these four new Sherlock Holmes stories by John Taylor 'An Inscrutable Masquerade'/ 'The Conundrum of Coach 13'/ 'The Trinity Vicarage Larceny'/ 'The 10.59 Assassin' Inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes stories, John Taylor has written four more mysteries featuring the world’s greatest detective. Read by acclaimed actor Benedict Cumberbatch, these new adventures share all the suspense of the original tales. In a drawer in his bureau, Dr Watson keeps a locked cedarwood chest – a ‘box of secrets’. It contains an archive of notes referring to some of Holmes’ cases that, for one reason or another, never saw the light of day. Now, for the first time, Watson has decided to reveal the truth to the world... In these four thrilling stories, Holmes experiments with the science of ballistics, locates some missing gold bullion, investigates the theft of a large amount of money and solves the baffling mystery of the Stovey murder. Learn how you can apply the main lessons & principles from The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck in a quick, easy listen!  For a considerable length of time, we've been informed that positive reasoning is the way to an upbeat, rich life. "F**k energy," Mark Manson says. "Let's be realistic, shit is f**ked and we need to live with it." In his uncontrollably mainstream Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat. He comes out with the plain truth—a measurement of crude, reviving, genuine truth that is painfully deficient with regards to today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his remedy to the cosseting, let's-all-vibe great outlook that has tainted present day society and ruined an age, compensating them with gold decorations only to appear.  Manson makes the contention, supported both by scholastic research and all around coordinated crap jokes, that enhancing our lives pivots not on our capacity to transform lemons into lemonade,instead on figuring out how to stomach lemons better. Individuals are defective and constrained—"not every person can be uncommon, there are victors and washouts in the public eye, and some of it isn't reasonable or something that you can control." Manson encourages us to become more acquainted with our confinements and acknowledge them. When we grasp our feelings of trepidation, issues, and vulnerabilities, when we quit running and staying away from and begin standing up to difficult facts, we can start to discover the bravery, persistence, trustworthiness, duty, interest, and absolution we look for.  There are just such huge numbers of things we can give a f**k about so we have to make sense of which ones extremely matter, Manson clarifies. While cash is pleasant, thinking about what you improve, on the grounds that genuine riches is about involvement. A truly necessary snatch you-by-the-shoulders-and-look at you without flinching snapshot of genuine talk, loaded up with engaging stories and indecent, merciless funniness, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a reviving slap for a generation to enable them to lead lives that have true meaning.   This audio captures the key takeaways found in the original book. All fluff and unnecessary information has been removed to save you hours of time. If you've already read the original, this audio will help you cement the most important lessons. If you haven't, don't worry, here you will find all the practical information that you can apply.   Gideon Cross. Falling in love with him was the easiest thing I’ve ever done. It happened instantly. Completely. Irrevocably. Marrying him was a dream come true.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, leaves a briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel in the Capitol Visitor Center with House leaders on December 12, 2018. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The House Intelligence Committee will release all transcripts from its 2017 and 2018 Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation — And eventually, the documents will be released to the public. The committee voted on the step to release the transcripts Wednesday at its organizational meeting, where it announced it will relaunch the probe and focus on five key areas of interest. The release peels back the curtain on closed-door discussions the then-Republican-controlled committee had with multiple close associates of President Donald Trump. The panel voted in closed session to release the documents and conducted more procedural business, during its first meeting under the leadership of its new Committee Chairman, Democrat Adam Schiff. The panel’s witness list over the past two years included Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser Roger Stone. Both have pleaded guilty or been indicted for lying to Congress. Watch: 18 times Trump mentioned WikiLeaks Democratic lawmakers have previously cast doubt on the congressional testimony of the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his son-in-law and senior adivser, Jared Kushner, among others. The committee’s decision to release the remaining transcripts to the special counsel will allow Mueller to comb them for inconsistencies, or answers that may not match up with evidence the special counsel has amassed through documents and interviews with the same people. To “protect ongoing investigative interests and information that remains classified,” the committee will release the transcripts on a rolling timeline, Intel Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement Wednesday. So that, “the American people have faith in the process and can assess for themselves the evidence that has been uncovered.” Schiff also laid out five “interconnected lines of inquiry” that Democrats feel ranking member Devin Nunes of California did not adequately pursue when he was chairman last Congress. Investigators will probe: Schiff also plans to draft legislation to “ensure the U.S. government is better positioned to counter future efforts to undermine our political process and national security,” he said. At his Tuesday State of the Union address, Trump warned Democrats not to impede his agenda with investigations into his administration, even though executive oversight is Congress’ constitutional prerogative. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” Trump said. Democrats have said they can walk (pass legislation) and chew gum (conduct oversight of the administration) at the same time. “Of course, the Constitution requires us to do both. That is exactly how it works,” Chairman Elijah Cummings of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform said in a statement Tuesday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday characterized the president’s comments on congressional oversight as a “threat.” “That was a threat,” Pelosi told reporters after a Democratic Caucus meeting. “The president should not bring threats to the floor of the House.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/shelby-trump-sotu-didnt-move-needle-border-security-talks---split---The State of the Union did not change the course of the border security conference committee, said Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) If President Donald Trump’s lengthy State of the Union remarks on immigration were intended to change the course of the congressional talks on border security, it doesn’t seem to have worked. Trump’s speech does not seem to have changed the dynamic much at all when it comes to negotiating a House-Senate spending compromise that the president would like to include funding for a physical border wall. At least, that was the view of Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby. “We’ve heard it before. I haven’t heard anything new tonight,” the Alabama Republican told a small group of reporters late Tuesday night. “He reiterated his position, which he’s continued to do.” “Tomorrow, we might create a dynamic to move us together, or we might not, but we’re going to hear from the professionals,” Shelby said, touting the conference committee’s plan to meet with Customs and Border Protection officials who are not political appointees. “The tone, I mentioned this earlier today, seems to be good. I talked to Nita about five or six o’clock today,” he said, referring to House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y. “I think they want to do it. We want to do it. We’re working hard at it.” Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, a fellow appropriator and member of the conference, was particularly troubled by Trump’s focus on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. “It is sickening for him to dwell on these statistics, criminal statistics involving immigrants when we know historically, the rate of crime committed by these immigrants is lower than the general population,” the Illinois Democrat said. “I could see the big smile on the faces of the immigrant haters.” But Durbin said that he still thought the conference committee should work to get a result that could at least make it to Trump’s desk for a potential signature. “What I heard from McConnell today was we should go about our business and finish this job,” Durbin said. “Let’s see if we can override the veto if we have to.” Durbin was referring to comments Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made earlier in the day Tuesday, saying he was hoping the conferees would strike a deal, regardless of what the president’s position was. “The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border,” Trump said, noting the next government funding deadline. As Trump was speaking, the White House circulated talking points highlighting the president’s interest in “working with Congress to solve our urgent immigration crisis,” but the document did not specify a price tag. Drawing in part from the president’s speech, the document said Trump was, “urging Congress to pass legislation to address the crisis at the border, which includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.wired.com/author/garrett-m-graff/---split---The special counsel's indictments have so far stopped short tying Trump and his associates to a broader conspiracy, blanks that will eventually get filled in. The indictment of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone sheds new light on where the special council believes the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks intersected. An explosive new report from Buzzfeed News makes the impeachment of Donald Trump not just possible, but likely. We know a lot about the "what" of the Mueller probe’s findings. The crucial questions now focus on the "why." The special counsel has lots of unfinished business—more indictments, more witnesses, a final report—to tackle this year. Here’s a rundown. In 1988 a bomb downed a jet in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 in the first major attack on Americans. Robert Mueller, then the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, oversaw the case. For him, it was personal. The investigation into Russian interference and Donald Trump has sprung so many offshoots, it's hard to keep track. Here's a comprehensive list. It's long. After Michael Cohen's sentencing, plenty more people and entities in Trump's orbit potentially sit in the special counsel's crosshairs. Sentencing documents for Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen drag President Trump harder into the legal spotlight. The Russia investigation's known unknowns give valuable hints about the special counsel's next moves. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Whether actively religious people also are healthier is less clear. Conrad Hackett, associate director for research and senior demographer, discusses the reasons for undertaking the study, why the subject is an important one and some of the challenges associated with trying to determine if and how religion impacts people’s well-being. Q: How did this study come about? It began with a challenging question from a journal editor at Science. My colleagues and I had submitted an article to the magazine that projected the future size of religiously unaffiliated populations. The editor came back to us and asked why he or anyone should care if people identify with a religion. And I realized then that there actually isn’t much research about how people with and without a religion vary on important outcomes like health, happiness, voting and volunteering. Sure, there’s research specifically linking frequent worship attendance with some socially desirable outcomes. But in the United States and other similar nations, most people don’t regularly attend religious services. And these non-attenders include many Christians and Jews, as well as people who don’t identify with a religion. I realized answering the Science editor’s question about the consequences of religious identity would require a study comparing the actively religious, the inactively religious and “nones” on various measures of well-being across a mix of countries. So that’s what we set out to do.

But when it comes to exploring the views of highly religious groups – white evangelical Protestants and black Protestants – a new survey approach finds their responses vary depending on how the question is asked. One approach in the Pew Research Center survey asked about evolution in a two-question “branched choice format.” First, survey respondents were asked if they believe humans have evolved over time. Those who said humans have evolved then branched to a second question which asked for their views about the processes behind evolution, including the role of God in those processes. When asked this way, about two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants (68%) took a “creationist” stance, saying that “humans have always existed in their present form since the beginning of time,” consistent with past Center surveys using a branched choice format with somewhat different question wording. But the results differed when the question was posed in single-question format to a random sample of respondents from the same survey. This approach asked about people’s views on whether or not human evolution has occurred, the processes behind evolution and the role of God in those processes together in one question. In this case, a 62% majority of white evangelical Protestants took the position that humans have evolved over time. Similarly, 59% of black Protestants asked about this topic in the two-question format said humans have always existed in their present form. By contrast, with the single-question format, just 27% of black Protestants said this, while a 71% majority said humans have evolved over time.

Passel Unauthorized immigrants make up a quarter of all U.S. foreign-born residents, but the share varies considerably among states. In 2016, they accounted for about a third of all immigrants in some states but fewer than one-in-ten in others, according to Pew Research Center’s recently released estimates. The estimates also found notable differences among states in other measures, such as the share of unauthorized immigrants who are Mexican born, the share who arrived in the previous five years and the share of the labor force consisting of unauthorized immigrants. The variations by state can be explored in a new interactive and downloadable series of a dozen maps and tables. Additional topics covered in the new maps and tables include the estimated number of unauthorized immigrants and change since 2007, their share of the population, the share of K-12 students with unauthorized immigrant parents and the top industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants work. (Estimates are not available for states with smaller unauthorized immigrant populations because of the small sample sizes in the census survey data that are the basis for our numbers.) Explore maps and tables showing detailed data on unauthorized immigrants across the country. Also available is another previously released interactive graphic exploring population trends for states, birth countries and regions.

However, that is less and less the case. Republicans and Democrats have been moving further apart not just in their political values and approaches to addressing the issues facing the country, but also on the issues they identify as top priorities for the president and Congress to address. For more than two decades, Pew Research Center has tracked the public’s priorities, including in our most recent survey. While many issues are considered high priorities by majorities in both parties today, there is virtually no common ground in the priorities that rise to the top of the lists for Democrats and Republicans. Read More → Topics: Political Polarization, U.S. Political Parties, Political Issue Priorities By Kristen Bialik Following a political standoff that briefly delayed his annual speech to the nation, President Donald Trump will deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The speech comes amid a debate between Trump and congressional Democrats over border security – one that recently led to the longest federal government shutdown in history. As Trump’s speech takes the spotlight, here’s a look at public opinion on important issues facing the country, drawn from Pew Research Center’s recent surveys. 1Border wall: A majority of Americans (58%) continue to oppose substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January. While opinion on the wall was little changed from last year, partisan views were more divided than ever: Republican support for the wall was at a record high and Democratic support was at a new low. A greater share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (69%) said this year that expanding the wall would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration than said so in 2017 (58%). Most Democrats and Democratic leaners, on the other hand, said a wall expansion would not have much impact on illegal immigration into the U.S. 2Immigration: A majority of Americans (58%) said they were not too or not at all confident in Trump’s ability to make wise decisions about immigration policy, according to the same January survey. Still, around half of U.S. adults (51%) said immigration should be a top priority for Trump and Congress this year, though Republicans (68%) were much more likely than Democrats (40%) to say this. Similarly, in a survey conducted in November, most Republicans and Republican leaners (68%) said reducing illegal immigration into the U.S. should be a top foreign policy priority, while just two-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners said this. Republicans were also more likely to view reducing legal immigration into the U.S. as a priority (41% vs. 14%). The U.S. public’s views of immigrants remain largely positive, with 62% saying immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents. But while most Democrats (83%) hold that view, just 38% of Republicans said the same. Around half of Republicans (49%) and just 11% of Democrats said immigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care. Read More → Topics: Federal Government, Donald Trump, Political Attitudes and Values, Political Issue Priorities By Neil G. Ruiz and John Gramlich The United States is home to more college-educated immigrants than any other country. As of 2015, there were 14.7 million immigrants ages 25 and older with a postsecondary diploma or college degree living in the U.S. – more than triple the number in Canada (4.4 million) and more than four times as many as in the United Kingdom (3.4 million), according to a recent Pew Research Center report. But the U.S. stands out less when looking at college-educated immigrants as a share of its overall foreign-born population. About a third (36%) of all immigrants in the U.S. have a college degree, well below the shares in Canada (65%), the UK (49%) and other economically advanced countries with substantial numbers of immigrants. President Donald Trump has expressed his support for the immigration of “talented and highly skilled people” to the U.S., and the American public appears to share that view. In a spring 2018 survey conducted as part of the Center’s recent report, 78% of U.S. adults said they support encouraging highly skilled people to immigrate to and work in the country. More than eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (83%) said this, as did 73% of Republicans and GOP leaners.

While Facebook remains immensely popular – and highly profitable – it has attracted scrutiny in the U.S. in recent years because of concerns over its ability to keep users’ personal information private and its role in the 2016 presidential election. Here are 10 facts about Americans and Facebook, based on Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2018: 1Around two-thirds (68%) of U.S. adults use Facebook, according to a survey conducted in January 2018. That’s unchanged from April 2016, the previous time the Center asked this question, but up from 54% of adults in August 2012. With the exception of YouTube – the video-sharing platform used by 73% of adults – no other major social media platform comes close to Facebook in terms of usage. Around a third of U.S. adults (35%) say they use Instagram, while smaller shares say they use Pinterest, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter and WhatsApp. Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp. 2Among U.S. adults who use Facebook, around three-quarters (74%) visit the site at least once a day, according to the January 2018 survey. The share of adult users who visit Facebook at least once a day is higher than the shares who visit Snapchat (63%) and Instagram (60%) at least once a day. However, similar shares of Facebook and Snapchat users say they visit each site several times a day (51% and 49%, respectively). Read More → Topics: Online Communities, Social Media, Internet Activities, Technology Adoption, Social Networking By Joey Marshall Studies have often credited religion with making people healthier, happier and more engaged in their communities. But are religiously active people better off than those who are religiously inactive or those with no religious affiliation? The short answer is that there is some evidence that religious participation does make a difference in some – but not all – of these areas, according to a new Pew Research Center report that looks at survey data from the United States and more than two dozen other countries. To shed more light on this question, researchers divided survey-takers into three categories: the “actively religious,” who identify with a religion and attend a house of worship at least monthly; the “inactively religious,” who identify with a religion but attend less frequently; and the unaffiliated (or “nones”), who do not identify with any religion. Here are five findings about the relationship between religion and health, happiness and civic engagement: 1 Actively religious people are more likely than their less-religious peers to describe themselves as “very happy” in about half of the countries surveyed. Sometimes the gaps are striking: In the U.S., for instance, 36% of the actively religious describe themselves as “very happy,” compared with 25% of the inactively religious and 25% of the unaffiliated. Notable happiness gaps among these groups also exist in Japan, Australia and Germany. 2 There is not a clear connection between religiosity and the likelihood that people will describe themselves as being in “very good” overall health. Even after controlling for factors that might affect the results, such as age, income and gender, there are only three countries out of the 26 where the actively religious are likely to report better health than everyone else — the U.S., Taiwan and Mexico. Religiously active people also don’t seem to be any healthier by two other, more specific measures: obesity and frequency of exercise. Read More → Topics: Religion and Society, Religious Affiliation, Religious Beliefs and Practices, Life Satisfaction, Lifestyle By Bradley Jones The American public’s views of the impact immigrants have on the country remain largely positive – and deeply partisan. As in recent years, a majority (62%) say immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents. Just 28% say immigrants are a burden on the country because they take jobs, housing and health care, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. These attitudes have changed little in the past few years, but they are very different from a quarter-century ago. In 1994, attitudes were nearly the reverse of what they are today: 63% of Americans said immigrants burdened the country and 31% said they strengthened it. An estimated 45.1 million immigrants were living in the U.S. in 2016, accounting for 13.9% of the nation’s population. Most (76%) are in the country legally. Republicans and Democrats have never been further apart in their views of immigrants than they are currently. Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party overwhelmingly say immigrants are a strength to the nation (83% say this); just 11% say immigrants burden the United States. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 38% say immigrants strengthen the country, while nearly half (49%) say they burden it. There also are sizable generational differences in opinions about immigrants. Three-quarters of Millennials (75%) say immigrants strengthen rather than burden the U.S. That compares with 63% of Gen Xers, 52% of Baby Boomers and 44% in the Silent Generation. In 1994, roughly comparable shares of Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents expressed positive views of immigrants. Generational differences are evident in both parties but are particularly stark among Republicans. More than half of Millennial Republicans (58%) say immigrants strengthen the country, compared with just 36% of Gen Xer Republicans and even smaller shares among older GOP generations. Among Democrats, there are only modest generational differences in these views, with no fewer than seven-in-ten of those in all generations saying this, including nearly nine-in-ten Millennial (88%) and Gen Xer (87%) Democrats. Note: See full topline results and methodology. By Phillip Connor and Abby Budiman Nearly 14% of the U.S. population was born in another country, numbering more than 44 million people in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This was the highest share of foreign-born people in the United States since 1910, when immigrants accounted for 14.7% of the American population. The record share was 14.8% in 1890, when 9.2 million immigrants lived in the United States.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/weird-youre-bringing-trump-sotu-shoutout-highlights-disparity-democratic-gop-women---split---Republican women know there is work to be done for more women to run and win elections. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) The dearth of Republican women in Congress was in the spotlight at the State of the Union when President Donald Trump praised the historic gains made in the 116th Congress, gains driven by Democratic victories and GOP losses. The number of House Republican women slipped in 2019 down from 23 in the previous congress to 13 now. And only one woman, Wyoming’s Liz Cheney, holds a top House leadership position in the GOP conference. Democrats, decked in white to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Congress voting to grant women the right to vote, were a little confused about the praise from Trump, but thundered applause for the president. “I was like ‘It’s weird you’re bringing this up,’” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Trump’s recognition of the women lawmakers. “I liked it when he acknowledged that it was the largest number of women. He forgot to acknowledge that it’s only 15 Republicans and 91 Democratic women in the Congress of the United States in the House of Representatives,” Pelosi told reporters as she exited the Capitol Tuesday night. (Pelosi’s numbers count delegates and Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner.) The Republican women applauded when Trump said that too, Rep. Susan Brooks said, noting the record number of women in Congress is a positive thing regardless of which party they hail from. “It was a lighter moment, and it was more of a fun moment,” the Indiana Republican said. But I was pleased quite frankly that the president acknowledged that we were at a new historic high for women. I thought that was great for him to acknowledge, and of course he acknowledged it by turning to the Democrat side.” The moment served as visual confirmation of how few GOP women there are in Congress — not that such a demonstration was needed. Republicans are acutely aware of the situation “It’s obvious,” Brooks said. “Hopefully it’s sending a message to everyone on my side of the aisle that we’ve got to work even harder at finding women at all levels of government to step up and consider running for Congress and to find women who have maybe never run for anything, like myself, to consider running. We’ve got I hope a strong movement. We can’t — and it shouldn’t be just the Democrats who have those really strong numbers. It should be our party as well.” As recruitment chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Brooks said she is out talking to women and men “to try to bring more diversity to our party in a whole bunch of ways.” New York Republican Elise Stefanik recruited more than 100 women as the first female head of recruitment at the NRCC last cycle. But only one of them prevailed, with many failing to make it through their primaries. She stepped back from the NRCC and has shifted her focus to supporting women candidates at the primary stages and building a framework for success. She says that electing more Republican women would be more reflective of the public. “What I’ve been focused on is providing support earlier and an infrastructure and a pipeline for women who choose to run, so they get the support and backing that they need to win the primary and then general election,” Stefanik said Wednesday. “We lost some very talented women members who either ran for higher office or lost this past election cycle,” she said. But there’s one thing she hopes to make clear to voters and potential candidates. “The Democratic Party does not have a monopoly on women,” said Stefanik. She was the only noticeable Republican to wear white, joining the centennial celebration of women’s suffrage. The Democratic women said the invite was bipartisan but Stefanik’s participation stuck out on the GOP side. Some Republican women thought the Democrats were being selfish in taking that moment to applaud while not acknowledging other highlights of Trump’s speech. “Things my Democrat women colleagues wouldn’t clap for at #StateOfTheUnion2019 tonight: America, freedom, free enterprise, law enforcement heroes, record low unemployment for women & minorities, the right of babies to live,” Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, the highest ranking GOP women, tweeted Tuesday night after the address. “Things they did clap for: themselves.” North Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx, one of the few Republican women in a committee leadership position as ranking member of the Education and Labor panel, said the moment showed Democrats’ “egos.” “I did find it intriguing that they sat on their hands and wouldn’t honor the World War II veterans, wouldn’t honor the police force, wouldn’t honor children surviving cancer and all of that stuff and then honored themselves. That was a pretty interesting response to it. They applauded themselves.” Foxx said she wasn’t concerned about the optics of the moment highlighting the disparity between Republican women and Democratic women and that Trump wasn’t trying to call attention to the GOP losses. “He just pointed out that this was a record number of women in the Congress,” she said. “That is a statement of fact, and it is something to celebrate.” Democrats may have vastly more women in their caucus, but they are still working to increase their numbers in 2020. “We’re not done. We’re going to have a big goal in the next cycle,” Florida Rep. Lois Frankel, chair of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, said. “We’re going to go for at least 100.” Trump’s acknowledgement of the record number of women during the State of the Union was “exhilarating” for Democrats, Frankel said. “It was funny, because, talk about somebody walking into it,” she said. “I think he thought we were applauding him. We sort of were, because it was because of him that we got this majority and we got all these women.” But that wasn’t the heart of it, she acknowledged: “To the tell you the truth, we were applauding ourselves.” Trump looked at the Republicans throughout the entire speech, except for that moment, Frankel said. “That’s the only time he really looked at us, because let’s face it, there’s not too many women on the other side,” she said. Frankel said she hopes the moment helped draw attention to the GOP’s women problem “because I think the whole institution would be better if there were more women on both sides.” Brooks and Frankel both expressing interest in more congressional women, regardless of party, is not surprising. They co-chaired the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus together last Congress, working together on legislation like a measure to protect young athletes from sexual abuse following the Olympic gymnastics scandal. This Congress, Michigan Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence and Arizona Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko are co-chairing the caucus. “We find things to work on together,” Brooks said on her way to House votes Wednesday. “And as a matter of fact I’m going in to see if I can get some women to join me on a trip to Guatemala to study what’s going on down there relative to women and children.” Simone Pathe contributed to this report.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/trump-offers-61-words-infrastructure-follow-awaited---split---President Donald Trump is seen in the House Chamber during his State of the Union address along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and VP Mike Pence on Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) It was only 61 words in a State of the Union speech that ran close to 5,500 words, but President Donald Trump declared Tuesday night that passage of an infrastructure package was a “necessity.” Lawmakers and industry groups that were hoping he would mention it agreed, though they said he will need to follow up if he’s serious. “Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure,” Trump said. “I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill. And I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a necessity.” House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter A. DeFazio said both parties can unite because aging roads, bridges, transit, airports and harbors are affecting the whole country. Watch: Optimistic, hypocritical and long: Members react to State of the Union in 3 words “None of this can happen, however, if we continue to ignore the looming crisis facing the Highway Trust Fund,” DeFazio said in a statement, citing an American Society of Civil Engineers estimate of a $1 trillion shortfall over 10 years between surface transportation work needed and funding likely to be available. “I will work to build bipartisan agreement around legislation, but I can’t do it alone,” DeFazio said. “This will require massive effort from the White House, stakeholders, and supporters in Congress to get something real across the finish line.” The committee will hold its first hearing on the issue Thursday and will hear about the scope of the problem from the governor of Minnesota, the mayor of Los Angeles, a former secretary of transportation, the chief executive officer of Amtrak, and leaders of labor unions and transportation industry leaders. Rep Sam Graves of Missouri, the panel’s ranking Republican, said in a statement that Congress and the administration have to find common ground. “With the President’s leadership on infrastructure, and the widespread agreement on the need to act, we have a prime opportunity to achieve something that matters to people across the country and to our economy,” Graves said. Dave Bauer, president of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, said an organization poll found support for improving infrastructure was widespread and bipartisan — 96 percent said it was very or somewhat important — while one of Trump’s other priorities, building a wall or barrier on the southern border, was opposed by 52 percent overall and split people along partisan lines. “When 90 percent of the country agrees on something, it’s a call to action,” Bauer said. “We commend President Trump for pressing bipartisan solutions. The last two federal surface transportation investment laws were achieved during eras of divided government. This time should be no different.” The White House had said infrastructure would be one of five themes of the speech, but it was the one that got the least attention, and one House freshman who ran last year on the importance of funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, pointed that out. “I cheered the president’s call to come together on issues like infrastructure. But I heard more specifics about building walls than bridges,” Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., said on Twitter. A fact sheet released by the White House on Tuesday had a quote at the top of it from last year’s State of the Union, in which Trump spoke about building “gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land.” In that speech, Trump said about three times as much about infrastructure, calling for streamlined permitting and a $1.5 trillion program. The budget his administration later delivered, however, had just $200 billion over 10 years, some of it taken from other programs, which was to be used to leverage another $1.3 trillion from private capital and states. With both chambers controlled by his party, Trump’s plan got no action. This year, business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are making a major push for action. Thomas J. Donohue, the chamber’s CEO, joined DeFazio on Tuesday for a news conference where he said they were going to “make it happen . . . and if people want to get in the way, that’s their own problem.” Donohue said the chamber supports raising the federal gas tax 5 cents a year for 5 years to fund expanded projects, and he promised to campaign for any lawmaker who came under attack for supporting it.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-blasts-house-intelligence-chair-announces-investigations-president---split---President Donald Trump is seen in the House Chamber after his State of the Union address on Tuesday, February 5, 2019. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) President Donald Trump escalated his State of the Union threat to Democrats Wednesday when blasted House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and suggested the California Democrat lacks any “basis” to launch a sweeping investigation of the president’s campaign and personal finances. “Under what basis would he do that? He has no basis to do that,” Trump told reporters after an event to announce his World Bank presidential nominee. Trump, who has in the past hit Schiff with one of his signature derisive nicknames, was eager to discredit what has become one of his biggest political threats. Democrats won control of the House, and now have the power — complete with subpoena powers— to investigate Trump’s campaign, businesses and presidency. “He’s just a political hack. He’s trying to build a name for himself,” Trump said of Schiff. “And I think that’s fine because that what they do.” “But there would be no reason to do that. No other politician has to go through that. It’s called presidential harassment,” the president said giving an in-person version of how he describes the investigations on Twitter. “And it’s unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country.” House Intelligence voted Wednesday to release all transcripts from its 2017 and 2018 Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation — And eventually, the documents will be released to the public. The committee voted on the step to release the transcripts Wednesday at its organizational meeting, where it announced it will relaunch the probe and focus on five key areas of interest. To “protect ongoing investigative interests and information that remains classified,” the committee will release the transcripts on a rolling timeline, Intel Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement Wednesday. So that, “the American people have faith in the process and can assess for themselves the evidence that has been uncovered.” During his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Trump warned House Democrats he would turn off the spigot on legislative cooperation if they insisted on launching the very kinds of probes Schiff announced just hours later. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” Trump said to audible groans from Democratic members. “It just doesn't work that way.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/gonzales/memorable-awkward-moments-state-union---split---Lawmakers applaud in the House chamber Tuesday night during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) I did something dangerous Tuesday night. I watched the State of the Union and the Democratic response on my own, without Twitter as a crutch. I even watched the C-SPAN feed on my phone in order to avoid commentary from the networks and cable channels. My goal was to avoid groupthink and try to formulate some coherent thoughts and analyses without being persuaded by my friends in the media. Here’s what stuck out to me. Everyone take a deep breath. It’s going to take a few days before we know whether President Donald Trump’s speech was effective and changed public opinion. It matters more what real voters thought about the event than talking heads on TV. Initial polls taken Tuesday night by CNN and CBS were positive for the president, but it’s much better to wait for some traditional, live-caller surveys to see if Trump’s job approval changed and if any movement lasts more than a few days. I start as skeptical that the State of the Union will fundamentally alter the political dynamic surrounding the president because nothing appears to fundamentally alter the political dynamic surrounding the president. He’s a polarizing figure. I think the most memorable moment was when the Democratic women of the House, dressed in suffragette white, stood in raucous applause to the president’s mention of women getting jobs and the record number of female lawmakers. It was stunning because everyone was happy, but for different reasons. The Democratic women took it as public acknowledgement of their achievement and an opportunity to celebrate their new majority. The president thought they were applauding him and, with both parties cheering and chanting “U-S-A,” it felt like a campaign rally, where Trump is most comfortable. Watch: Optimistic, hypocritical and long — Members react to State of the Union in 3 words In the beginning and end of the speech, Trump struck a conciliatory tone and challenged Congress to reach for greatness, set aside partisanship and embrace an exciting new journey. It sounded like the type of speech most people expect a president to give, but those passages can’t be viewed in a vacuum. This State of the Union was delayed because of partisan bickering. And while some people heard a call to bipartisanship, Democrats heard the president call them soft on gangs, socialists, and baby killers, too focused on investigating him. About an hour into the almost 90-minute address, there was a list of issues that could receive bipartisan support: prescription drug prices, eliminating the HIV epidemic in the next 10 years, more funding to counter childhood cancer, paid family leave, and, predictably, infrastructure. But the question is whether both parties can move beyond the stalemate surrounding funding the government and the fight over the border wall. I thought Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams did a fine job in avoiding a Saturday Night Live-worthy gaffe or moment. It’s a hard speech to give and she did what she needed to do. But what stuck out to me was her focus on an entirely different set of issues compared to Trump’s speech. She talked about furloughed federal workers, “children in cages,” gun violence, climate change, judges, and access to voting. I don’t think the president talked about any of those things, at least not in the same context. The parties can’t agree on what problems to focus on, let alone what solutions are necessary. Another memorable moment was briefly toward the beginning of the speech when Trump talked about cooperation, compromise and common good. The camera cut away to a shot of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III on his feet, clapping, while New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sat behind him doing nothing. It’s a great example of the different ways Democrats approach the president, especially given the number of Democrats in the new Congress who represent areas that support Trump. It also represents the challenge Democrats will face balancing varying political realities moving forward. As expected, the president did not declare a national emergency on the southern border, but he did lay out the case he’ll likely make if that time comes. With stats and stories about crime and MS-13, you can expect to hear much of the same after the Feb. 15 deadline, if Congress doesn’t come up with an agreement that he finds sufficient. Trump voiced his disapproval about investigations twice during his speech, with mixed results. The first time was in a list of complaints against Democrats, and Republicans in the chamber applauded the line. But the president immediately came back to the point and mentioned investigations again, and there was hardly any applause or reaction from either side. I thought it was going to be another Jeb Bush “Please clap” moment. I think it’s an indicator that while Republicans might not agree with the investigations, they’re not going to give a standing ovation to the president on a call to end them.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/unshackled-by-leadership-appropriators-ready-to-deal-on-border---split---Top congressional leaders say they will leave a border security conference committee to work its will. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) The top congressional leaders in both chambers have a message for the 17 appropriators making up the House-Senate conference committee on Homeland Security spending: Do your thing. And that’s a positive sign for negotiations on border security funding that are going down to the wire again, with a Feb. 15 deadline to avert yet another partial government shutdown. Appropriators want to reach at least an agreement in principle by the end of this week, to be able to start putting pen to paper over the weekend. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby of Alabama said the target for releasing legislative text is Monday, which would enable the House to take up the measure Thursday — given that chamber’s 72-hour rule — before sending it on to the Senate, where it could need to clear a 60-vote filibuster threshold. If they can’t make it in time, but have things close to nailed down, another short-term stopgap could be in the offing, Shelby said after a closed-door briefing with Customs and Border Protection officials Wednesday. House Appropriations ranking member Kay Granger of Texas added that she “absolutely” thinks a deal is achievable next week, if not this week. The talks got a shot in the arm this week from each chamber’s leader, who previously had kept to each sides’ respective political talking points: Republicans backed Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall or “physical barrier,” while Democrats offered zero dollars for the wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday night after President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address and again on Wednesday that she planned to let the conferees work their will. “Left to their own devices I think they can have an agreement on time by Friday,” the California Democrat said Wednesday. “If they have a bipartisan agreement, I will support it.” She said she communicated as much to Shelby earlier in the week, and to Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday night. That puts Pelosi in the same camp as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, another veteran Senate Appropriations member who for years sat across the table from Pelosi hammering out details of the annual foreign assistance budget. McConnell said Tuesday he planned to let Shelby come up with a package, and then “we’ll hope the president finds it worth signing.” Trump didn’t give an inch in his speech Tuesday night, however, nor did CBP officials who backed up the president’s call for $5.7 billion in wall funding at the closed briefing Wednesday, according to Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin. “They’re trying to rationalize the whole $5.7 billion,” the Illinois Democrat said. Separately, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer told reporters “I don’t think any of us can be confident” that Trump would sign a bipartisan package. If Trump vetoed it and all of the GOP-led Senate’s 45 Democrats and two independents stuck together on an override vote, they would need 20 of the chamber’s 53 Republicans to join them and abandon their own president. Also watch: As lawmakers begin to hash out border security, how do conference committees work? But Durbin added that the unnamed officials acknowledged that cross-border drug trafficking, which runs through ports of entry that have little capacity to inspect all the vehicles coming through every day, was a major problem. Durbin asserted that when he asked the CBP officials to give lawmakers a priority list for the spending talks, “what they said was technology. They don’t rule out barriers, they don’t rule out fences, but technology was their first priority.” Still, Durbin seemed to indicate some form of middle ground on border barrier spending was on the table. “What we need to have is clear direction on the total amount that’s being spent, what we can put into barriers and fences. Those are the two things I think are central to reaching a bipartisan agreement,” he said. Similarly, Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, said a compromise would necessarily need to cut the president’s demand down to size. “I think that there is a path forward but people need to understand we are not going to do the $5.7 billion,” Cuellar said. “$5.7 billion for a wall, no way. Can we add technology, can we add modernization of ports, can we add personnel? … I think we all agree that it has to be a comprehensive thing.” Under the discretionary spending caps for fiscal 2019, assuming the other six outstanding appropriations bills don’t change substantively, the conference committee has roughly $49 billion to spend. Senate Republicans, in an earlier proposal, beefed up that figure to about $55 billion, mainly through the use of emergency funding for the wall and other Trump demands to get around the spending caps. Another Democratic conferee, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, suggested conferees have been instructed to live within the existing spending caps, which limits their options to grow CBP’s budget. The DHS bill also funds agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “In order to fund certain priorities and stay within the caps, you’re got to pull money from other areas,” Aguilar said. “So we’re trying to stay within the caps. That means we’ve got to be mindful of all the moving parts.” One of those moving parts, of course, is Trump himself. And the president’s reaction to whatever compromise emerges from the Appropriations committees remains the great unknown, on both sides of the aisle and perhaps among Trump’s close advisers as well. “I’m optimistic about what the appropriators are doing,” Pelosi said late Tuesday. “I do know that left to their own devices, they weigh their equities, they understand the resources that are available, the differences that we have and they can come up with a path. And the only problem is that [Trump] would stand in the way of that path.” David Lerman, Niels Lesniewski, Kellie Mejdrich, Jennifer Shutt and Katherine Tully-McManus contributed to this report.

---split---10.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/mr-president-get-real-democrats-reject-trumps-sotu-alarm-about-socialism---split---House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., pictured walking through Statuary Hall to the House chamber for President Donald Trump’s State of the Union Feb. 5, dismissed Trump’s remark about the rise of socialism as “demagoguing.” (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Republican efforts to label the Democratic Party as socialists reached a new high Tuesday night as President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to further that partisan message — prompting groans and grimaces from Democrats. “We are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Trump said. “America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” While some Democrats stood to applaud the last line pledging the U.S. will never become a socialist country — including a handful of Democrats running for president in 2020 — most of the party reacted with dismay that Trump went there. Some were shown on the C-SPAN cameras scowling. “It was such a demagoguing approach that the scowling was, ‘Mr. President, get real,’” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Wednesday. “There’s no issue about socialism, that we want to leave the free market capitalist system. I don’t think that’s an issue in the Congress,” the Maryland Democrat added, dismissing the remarks as Trump trying to rile his base, “Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter et al.” Hoyer dismissed much of Trump’s State of the Union address in that way. “It was a campaign rally for the most part,” he said. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile seized on the message. “The World War II veteran in his nineties got up more times to applaud than a lot of those Democrats when he was talking about the greatness of this country and rejecting socialism,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said on Fox News after speech. “That’s how far to the left they’ve moved.” The next morning Scalise and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California doubled down on that attack line during a Republican leadership press conference. “One of the strongest-made statements [Trump] made was for those World War II vets, who fought for our freedoms — that we will not have socialism in America. He will stand up against it,” McCarthy said. While Democrats don’t seem too concerned about Republicans attacking them as socialists, it has forced them to have to answer questions about it and explain why they are not. “House Democratic Caucus supports a well-regulated, free-market economy that is also anchored in a robust social safety net including Social Security and Medicare,” Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Wednesday when asked about Trump’s remarks. “We as House Democrats support what I would term compassionate capitalism that is based on an emphasis of the well being of working families, middle-class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick and the afflicted,” the New York Democrat added. “Donald Trump apparently supports crony capitalism.” Optimistic, hypocritical and long: Members react to State of the Union in 3 words Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-sounds-familiar-notes-defense-state-union---split---President Donald Trump arrives in the House chamber to deliver his State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) President Donald Trump stressed his principal defense positions in his State of the Union address Tuesday, without providing new details about planned troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. The only news was announcement of the date and location of his second summit with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un — on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Trump said he believed that if he had not been elected, the United States would “right now” be fighting a “major war” with North Korea that might have killed millions. Trump touted the U.S. military as “the most powerful on Earth by far.” During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said the military was in a degraded state. In his remarks, the president specifically touted the U.S. missile defense system — even though its component parts have been in development for decades. Watch: SOTU: A brief history He reaffirmed the U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces treaty, which bars the United States and Russia from deploying land-based ballistic and cruise missiles of certain ranges. He noted the need to end America’s long-running wars, specifically mentioning Syria and Afghanistan, where 3,000 and 14,000 U.S. troops are deployed, respectively. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” Trump said. He celebrated the liberation of “virtually all” of the territory the Islamic State once held in Syria and Iraq. "Now," he said, "as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.” However, military and intelligence officials have warned over the last week about the latent threat posed by thousands of ISIS fighters who have gone to ground in Syria and Iraq. On Monday, the Senate overwhelmingly adopted a GOP-written resolution that, without naming Trump, warned against a “precipitous” withdrawal from Syria or Afghanistan. On Afghanistan, Trump touted peace talks underway between U.S. officials and “a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.” Trump did not mention that America’s ally, the Afghan government, has been excluded from those talks, much to its anger. And many critics wonder, too, whether the Taliban can be trusted to keep Afghanistan free of al-Qaida and ISIS going forward. Trump continued to paint refugees on the U.S.-Mexico border as a national security threat warranting deployment of U.S. troops. He reminded Congress he would add 3,750 active-duty troops on the border. When combined with departures of other troops, the net addition of active-duty soldiers appears to be closer to 2,000. The surge of forces will soon bring the total of both active and Guard troops on the border close to 6,500. Trump also assailed Iran and said he withdrew America from the multinational nuclear deal with that country in order “to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons,” even though U.S. and international experts have said that Iran halted its nuclear work under the agreement and has yet to resume it. “We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America' and threatens genocide against the Jewish people,” Trump said of Iran. Then, in an attempt to connect Iran to anti-Semitic violence, he transitioned to a description of attacks on Jews — from the gunfire at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October to the Nazi death camps in the 1940s.

All market data delayed 20 minutes. Tucker Carlson: The irony and double standard in the Kavanaugh and Fairfax scandals are unbelievable. President Trump's powerful State of the Union speech showed why he was elected. It was at times moving, funny, inspiring, feisty and visionary. The real test for President Trump will be to unify the country, despite his increasingly divisive policies. “Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years,” President Trump said in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. “Great nations do not fight endless wars.” In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, President Trump announced he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam Feb. 27 and 28. But Trump gave no clues as to how this new round of talks will move the denuclearization ball forward in the face of a recalcitrant North Korea. Every once in a while a speech is so effective and powerful it changes the trajectory of history. President Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address was that kind of speech. I was honored to be among those Americans selected to sit in the House gallery at the State of the Union address Tuesday night. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on new gun control legislation Democrats plan to push on the American people. Democrats would not allow me to speak. Here's the testimony I planned to give. President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to focus the nation on policies which can unite rather than divide us. Wednesday is the 108th anniversary of the birth of one of our greatest presidents – Ronald Reagan. And as we saw in the Super Bowl Sunday, “Reagan” still means “right.” In his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, President Trump talked about the strong economic and jobs growth in the U.S. under his administration. While this success story gets far less attention than it deserves, it has benefitted all Americans. I’ve never seen a group of Washington lawmakers visibly upset to hear that America is back at work. But that's exactly what I saw from Democrats at last night's State of the Union. The anti-Trump media greeted the president’s speech with snark, sarcasm and outright opposition. Latest opinion cartoons from FoxNews.com Two years of success show the never-Trumpers and mainstream media were wrong about President Trump. Tucker Carlson: The irony and double standard in the Kavanaugh and Fairfax scandals are unbelievable. President Trump's powerful State of the Union speech showed why he was elected. It was at times moving, funny, inspiring, feisty and visionary. It has been 30 years since Ronald Reagan left the White House and nearly 15 since he died. As a second generation reaches adulthood since his time in Washington, it is important to remember what he meant to our country and how we still benefit. Rather than turning up the temperature and giving in to the broken status quo and division in Washington, President Trump is asking Democrats to choose greatness by rejecting resistance and instead compromise for the good of the American people.

---split---17.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/trump-pledges-investment-silent-key-tech-issues/---split---In his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Trump promised legislation to invest in "the cutting-edge industries of the future." But the speech was characteristically backward-looking. Trump talked up gains in manufacturing jobs and oil and gas exports, but didn't once mention the word "technology," nor any other tech policy issue, such as privacy, broadband, or antitrust. Aides filled in the blanks. "President Trump’s commitment to American leadership in artificial intelligence, 5G wireless, quantum science, and advanced manufacturing will ensure that these technologies serve to benefit the American people and that the American innovation ecosystem remains the envy of the world for generations to come,” said Michael Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, in a statement. https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1092979754762948608 Still, some of the administration’s other signature policy positions, such as the trade war with China and its hard-line position on immigration, may be holding back progress in these areas. Of these issues, the Trump administration has perhaps been most active on 5G, an umbrella term for next-generation wireless technologies and standards that could one day enable download speeds of up to 10 GB on your phone, or around 10 times the speed of Google Fiber's standard home service. We're still a long way from seeing those types of speeds in reality, even as carriers begin offering "5G"-branded services in a few cities. Politicians and pundits across the political spectrum warn that if the US falls behind China in deploying 5G, the next generation of mobile platforms could emerge in China, just as Android and iOS and their respective app stores emerged in the US during earlier wireless eras. The Trump administration sees the race to 5G as a national security issue as much as an economic issue. The US has long feared that Chinese telco giant Huawei could plant backdoors in its equipment that the Chinese government could use to spy on US citizens. US carriers like AT&T and Verizon are effectively banned from using Huawei gear in their networks; but the Trump administration fears that if China gets a leg up on 5G, there will be few if any alternatives to Huawei and other Chinese vendors to build the next generation of wireless networks. That led to the unusual decision to block Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom from buying US wireless chip giant Qualcomm, even though Broadcom offered to relocate to the US. Beyond efforts to curb Huawei’s global reach, the White House hosted a summit on 5G last September, and Trump has encouraged federal agencies to accelerate the construction of 5G networks. Much of the focus is on opening up more wireless spectrum to carriers. The Federal Communications Commission, which is responsible for licensing access to the spectrum, has identified a few chunks of spectrum that can be repurposed for 5G. Its first 5G-related spectrum auction ended last month, and another is scheduled to begin March 14. But carriers say they need more. In a comment filed last month with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which advises the president on telecommunications policy issues, the industry group CTIA complained that less than 6.5 gigahertz of spectrum is devoted to mobile wireless while nearly 30 gigahertz is dedicated to satellite communications. Trump signed a memo last year calling for a national strategy to allocate more spectrum to 5G, but it was short on specifics. In 2017, US senators Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) and Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire) introduced a more detailed plan called the Airwaves Act, which identifies several ranges of spectrum frequency that could be repurposed and auctioned off over several years. The bill was reintroduced in the House last year but has yet to see a vote in either chamber. Apart from auctioning spectrum, the government has been mostly focused on slashing telecom regulations on the theory that it will encourage more investment. For example, the FCC repealed its Obama-era net neutrality protections, which banned broadband providers from blocking, throttling, or otherwise discriminating against lawful content. FCC chair Ajit Pai argued, despite ample evidence to the contrary, that the change was necessary in part because the rules deterred investment in broadband infrastructure. A real national broadband policy needs to serve the needs of the public, not just the carriers. "The problem is that the wireless industry is very good at using this hype to blow through any sort of regulatory oversight that's designed to protect consumers, and to ignore the problem of rural broadband," says Harold Feld of the consumer group Public Knowledge. Without oversight, Feld says, the industry might not deploy the fastest 5G technologies in places they consider less profitable, like low-income areas. Regulators would do well to keep that in mind when considering T-Mobile’s proposed acquisition of Sprint. The companies say the merger would enable them to build 5G networks faster. But it would also reduce competition for wireless services and could lead to higher prices. Meanwhile, there's more the government could do to help the US stay competitive in 5G. Building 5G networks will be expensive. One of the main technologies that carriers hope to use takes advantage of what's called the millimeter-wave spectrum. Using this part of the spectrum could enable the mind-boggling speeds that 5G boosters promise, but blanketing cities and towns with millimeter-wave signals would require a huge number of cellular towers. These could be as small as smoke detectors, but just like your home Wi-Fi router, these microcells will need wired connections to the internet. That will mean a big investment in fiber-optic networks that hardly anyone is talking about. Last year, leaked documents revealed a proposal for the government to build a 5G network to complement commercial networks. The idea was widely panned across the political spectrum, and the White House denied that the idea was ever seriously considered. But, as Harvard Law professor Susan Crawford wrote for WIRED last year, a national program to build more fiber-optic networks isn't a crazy idea. Ironically, the Trump administration's trade war with China may be hampering US progress on 5G, says FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. "There are new tariffs on Chinese imports of key network inputs like modems, routers, and antennas," she told WIRED in statement. "They raise the price of deployment of 5G domestically and make it harder for the United States to lead." But during Tuesday’s address, Trump doubled down on tariffs. Although Trump didn’t mention the technology specifically Tuesday night, the White House has already signaled it would take a stronger interest in artificial intelligence in 2019. National AI strategies are becoming quite popular—outside the US. A Canadian report from December noted 18 national or pan-national AI plans, including those from China, France, and the European Union. The US should join that roll in the next few months. In December the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s lead on AI said that the US would have a new AI research strategy this spring. https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1092980492507533313 The OSTP statement released Tuesday name-checked AI but didn’t offer any specifics on what new support Trump might offer people or companies working on the technology. In its limited AI engagement so far, the administration has portrayed AI primarily as a way to exert dominance over other nations. The Pentagon has established a Joint AI Center to speed adoption of the technology by US forces. A one-day White House summit on AI last year focused on how it gives the US an economic advantage. And the Department of Commerce is considering whether to use arms control rules to restrict US companies from exporting some AI technologies, in areas such as image recognition or machine translation. Chris Meserole, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, hopes the Trump administration can broaden its view of AI. The government needs to pay close attention to the technology’s effects on society as it is adopted in areas such as finance, education, law enforcement, and moderating online speech, he says. Trump will also need to consider how his tough stance on immigration could undermine what OSTP’s Kratsios called his “commitment to American leadership in artificial intelligence.” That leadership is built on the diverse talent at American research institutions and tech companies. “It’s a small pool of folks, maybe ten to twenty thousand people, and a lot of those are foreign-born Americans,” Meserole says. “We’re going to need a sensible immigration policy to maintain our lead in AI.” https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1092980494399139840 Talent is also an area of concern for quantum computing, another emerging technology in which the US has a lead that Trump says he wants to maintain. In December he signed a bill authorizing more than $1.2 billion of spending in support of quantum R&D and talent development over five years. But new funds have not yet been appropriated for the program. Backers of the bill like Chris Monroe, a professor at the University of Maryland and CEO of quantum computing startup IonQ, say that Trump’s immigration policies are undermining efforts to expand America’s pool of quantum engineers. “The scientific community is aligned on that we want to keep these people here and encourage more people to come,” he says. As expected, Trump talked up his dream of a border wall. But he had nothing to say about attracting the sort of talent the US will need to lead in the cutting-edge industries of the future. Let’s hope the actual legislation has more substance. 5G is the next generation of high-speed wireless communication. It should speed up your phone's data service to the point that it's bonkers fast.

---split---24.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/immigration-talk-dulls-trump-state-union-unity-message---split---President Donald Trump greets lawmakers as he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union address. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Republican lawmakers stood and roared Tuesday night as President Donald Trump described the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as a hellscape awash in drugs and violent criminals moving freely into the country. Democrats sat statuesque and silent, displaying no sign that his call for cross-party cooperation resonated inside the House chamber. Trump stood before Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi and delivered what has become customary for Republican and Democratic presidents alike, saying that the state of the country is “strong” and that the American people hope “we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.” And while he added some quintessential Trumpian bravado when he implored members of both parties to “choose greatness” over “pointless destruction,” the president’s second State of the Union address revealed a government — like the country for which it ostensibly works — as divided as ever. He bemoaned “ridiculous partisan investigations” as House Democrats prepare to look into many aspects of his 2016 campaign, business dealings and presidency. Watch: Optimistic, hypocritical and long: Members react to State of the Union in 3 words  “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” he said after also panning “foolish” overseas conflicts. “It just doesn’t work that way.” As he spoke, Pelosi rolled her eyes. The reactions of the two parties in the chamber perhaps couldn’t have been starker than when the president spoke about immigration and his proposed southern border wall. “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” he said, returning to the populist rhetoric of his 2016 campaign. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. “Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business,” Trump said. [Trump’s call for unity likely to ring hollow among Democrats] Republican members hooted and cheered those and other hard-line immigration lines as they stood to praise their unlikely leader just over two years after he stood outside the Capitol and vowed to end what he called an “American carnage” rooted in illegal immigration, crime, drugs and violent gangs. Some Democrats, however, booed. Two weeks after the halfway point of his current term, Trump’s overall assessment of the country since his chilly January 2017 inauguration address is less gloomy — except on the intertwined issues he returns to again and again as he looks to keep his conservative base energized: illegal immigration and his proposed southern border wall. “This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens,” President Trump said, echoing 2016 Candidate Trump and likely the version of himself who is expected to seek a second term. The president’s address, at times, had a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde feel. That’s because of its contradictory mix of calls for Democrats to support rather than continue resisting his policies and what amounted to the kinds of hard-line immigration rhetoric that have caused them to label his border wall “immoral.” “The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people,” said the president, wearing a bright red tie and his usual crisp white shirt under a dark suit. “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.” But in its immigration section came a call for the border wall that has left Washington so divided. “Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down,” Trump said of areas where walls, barriers or fencing already exist. Watch: Remember When Donald Trump Wanted Mexico To Pay for the Wall? Specifically, Trump singled out two issues for bipartisan cooperation. “Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure,” he said, a rare line that drew a bipartisan standing ovation. “It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.” But he also noted how his administration has moved on its own and alluded to bills it passed solely with GOP votes, seemingly undermining the call for unity. “Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades,” he said. But as the president made his latest pitch for the border structure pitch, Democrats drowned him in silence just 10 days before the two sides must reach a border security pact he says must fund the wall or allow a quarter of the federal government to again shut down. The president attempted to use the economy, which he dubbed “the envy of the world,” as leverage over the Democrats assembled for the annual spectacle. “After 24 months of rapid progress … America is winning each and every day.” [The state of the union in 8 charts] His second State of the Union came at a time when “by broad measures the U.S. has performed well,” according to Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at the consumer financial services firm Bankrate.com. The address allowed the president “to paint a vision of legislative priorities for the year ahead in the face of divided government” amid an “unemployment rate [that] has remained at or below 4 percent since February of last year” and sizable wage growth, Hamrick added. Despite those statistics and Trump’s sunny analysis about the economy’s health, Democratic leaders were shunning both hours before Trump boarded his heavily armed limousine and headed to the Capitol. “The American people know the truth,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said on the Senate floor. “The American people know the Trump economy is failing the middle class and those struggling to get there. In Trump’s economy, multinational corporation and the already wealthy were given a tax cut, while American workers were left behind. Schumer went on to charge the Trump administration with “relentless sabotage” of a “failing” health care system and said its number of acting officials and turnover shows it is a government in “chaos.” The New York Democrat labeled Trump’s foreign policy “woefully backward.” “Allies are alienated and criticized. Our adversaries emboldened and praised,” Schumer said. “Dictators and strongmen are given license by this administration while our NATO allies receive harsh words.” Trump appeared to have watched his floor speech live, firing off a tweet criticizing Schumer for blasting the speech before it had been delivered. In a sign one speech will do little to heal Washington’s deep wounds, the Senate Democrats’ leader responded in a most Trumpian way: with a tweet of his own, pointing the president to this part of his floor remarks: “Even more empty than his policy promises are President Trump’s calls each year for unity.” Thanks for watching my speech but you must have missed this line:  But during the address, the commander in chief painted a much different picture. [Cracks in GOP support for Trump emerge, but White House claims ‘we’re all good’] Trump reminded the country he promised a “new approach” to foreign policy as a candidate, adding: “Great nations do not fight endless wars.” Still, he sent a warning to Iran when he vowed to “not avert our eyes from a regime that chants ‘Death to America’ and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.” Even before he reached the podium in the chamber’s well, Democrats greeted him cooly. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and others among their ranks, did not applaud as he made his way down the aisle. Republican lawmakers, especially its interventionist establishment wing, did greet his calls to end American’s “endless” post-9/11 foreign conflicts with discomfort. But mostly on Tuesday night, Republican members stood by a president whose approval ratings hover around 40 percent against a disapproval rating that often is above 55 percent, and who frustrated much of the country over an unpopular government shutdown over a border wall that multiple surveys show a majority of the country opposes. A recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found 63 percent of Americans say the country is on the wrong track. That is shaping up to be a problem for congressional Republicans, one analyst said. “The Republican Party doesn’t have a forward-looking agenda outside of this immigration debate,” said Vanessa Williamson, a Brookings Institution senior fellow. “And having shut down the government over it and not seeing substantial improvement in the public in terms of support for the kind of immigration policies that Trump has called for has left them in a real bind.” But Republicans inside the chamber seemed pleased. When the president declared “our union is strong,” Republicans jumped to their feet and started an “U-S-A” chant. Democrats were spotted rolling their eyes as they remained seated — offering no applause.

---split---37.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/what-robert-mueller-knows-and-isnt-saying-trump-russia-investigation/---split---It’s only Wednesday, but the increasingly sprawling investigations surrounding President Donald Trump this week have already sprawled even further. News came Monday that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York served a wide-ranging subpoena digging into the finances of the Trump inaugural committee. Then, Wednesday morning, the House Intelligence Committee—in its first meeting of the new congress—voted to hand-over witness transcripts from its own Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller, a move widely understood to be motivated by the belief of Democratic members that various witnesses, including perhaps Donald Trump, Jr., have lied to them. Meanwhile, Roger Stone—himself indicted, in part, because of his alleged lies to Congress and witness tampering that encouraged his associates “to do a ‘Frank Pentangeli,’” a reference to a Godfather Part II character who lied to Congress—continues his bizarre post-indictment media roadshow. A close reading of the Stone indictment shows the odd hole at the center of Mueller investigation so far. It followed a now familiar pattern: Mueller’s court filing included voluminous detail, including insight into the internal decision-making process of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign—and yet the indictment stopped short of alleging that Stone was part of a larger conspiracy. Given how much Trump says, in all settings, all the time, his silences are just as conspicuous as Mueller’s. All told, according to a recent tally by The New York Times, “more than 100 in-person meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails and private messages on Twitter” took place between Trump associates and Russians during the campaign and transition. But while we’ve seen a lot of channels, we’ve thus far from Mueller’s court filings seen near silence about what was said during those contacts—and why. In court filings that are remarkable for their level of detail and knowledge, Mueller’s conspicuous silence about those conversations stands out. Of course, one possible explanation is that 100 percent of the content of the conversations was completely innocent—totally normal directions and innocent chit-chat about “adoptions,” sanctions, potential business deals, and geopolitical diplomacy. That could explain why Mueller thus far has only charged individuals, including Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, and Roger Stone with lying about those contacts, not the underlying behavior. Yet the evidence against such innocence seems clear too, in the form of consistent lies, omissions, and obfuscations about the numerous meetings, conversations, and contacts with Russians throughout the Trump campaign, transition, and presidency. To take just two examples: The best evidence that Donald Trump knew something about his dealings with Russia over the Trump Tower Moscow project were shady is that he lied about the project, extensively, for more than two years. If he’d really believed the project was on the up-and-up, it’s easy to imagine Trump as a candidate making a public to-do about the deal—arguing that he felt America’s relationship with Russia was off-track, and that as the world’s smartest businessman, he alone could set it right. Trump could have made the case on the campaign trail that he alone could make deals with Putin because he alone was making deals with Putin. Yet he didn’t make that argument, and remained entirely silent about the deal for years, even lying about his interest in Russia. Given how much Trump says, in all settings, all the time, his silences are just as conspicuous as Mueller’s. And then there’s the continued controversy over Trump’s private conversations with Vladimir Putin at geopolitical gatherings, from Hamburg to Helsinki to Buenos Aires. Under normal circumstances and operations, US leaders meet with Russian leaders to advance geopolitical conversations, and then “read-out” those meetings to staff in order to execute the work and vision hashed out one-on-one. The entire point of those head-of-state conversations is to generate follow-up work for staff later—to come to agreements, to advance national interests, and to find common ground for action on areas of shared concern. And yet in city after city, President Trump has had suspicious conversations with Putin, where he goes out of his way to ensure that no American knows what to follow-up on. In Hamburg, he confiscated his translators’ notes. In Buenos Aires, he cut out American translators entirely. If he’s truly advocating for the United States in these meetings, there’s no sign those conversations have translated into any action by White House or administration staff afterwards. Instead, quite the opposite. Trump has emerged from those conversations to spout Kremlin talking points, even, apparently, calling The New York Times from Air Force One on the way back from Hamburg to argue Putin’s point that he didn’t interfere with the 2016 election. Mueller presumably has far more knowledge about the “why” and the “what” of the interactions between Trump’s orbit and Russia than he’s shared so far. The Stone indictment is the latest court filing to show two-way conversation, flowing from Trump to WikiLeaks or Trump to Moscow and back again, without ever making clear what, precisely, was flowing back or forth. In fact, the one thing that remains clear is just how much Mueller knows: He’s uncovered “track changes” in individual Microsoft Word documents, he’s referenced what specific words Russian military intelligence officers Googled three years ago, and even what the hired trolls inside the Internet Research Agency were wrote to family members. Long before the House Intelligence Committee today kicked over a few dozen transcripts, Mueller amassed some 290,000 documents from Michael Cohen, tons more from the Trump transition team, and what the White House says is 1.4 million documents it turned over voluntarily, among countless other files, documents, reports, and classified raw intelligence. Given that foundation of knowledge, it’s worth examining some of the “known unknowns,” places where Mueller has been silent but where he presumably knows far more than he’s chosen to say. To single out just five examples: Who directed the campaign’s contact with Roger Stone—and what flowed back and forth? Much has been made in the days since the Stone indictment about paragraph 12 of the court filing, which says “a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [Wikileaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign.” That simple “was directed” appears to indicate Mueller knows about the internal decision-making of the Trump campaign—and that he knows who directed the campaign’s contact to Stone, a pool of officials that has to be quite small. Mueller could have easily written the sentence in a thousand less indicative ways—saying simply that Stone was contacted by a senior Trump campaign official or that someone “suggested” or “told” that official to contact Stone. Instead, by saying “was directed,” Mueller implies a level of authority, and even hints at a possible internal conspiracy to make contact with Stone, if it was for nefarious purposes—but Mueller stops short of saying who or why. What more is there in the Flynn case that’s worth knowing? Similarly, while Mueller stops short of confirming whether Stone and his associates, Jerome Corsi or Randy Credico, actually ever did have contact with WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, a hole in the indictment so gaping that its absence is inexplicable unless it’s being saved for some future court filing. Similarly, Mueller only outlines Stone’s requests for stolen emails, not whether anything flowed back to Stone from WikiLeaks. Again, we’re left with the puzzle: Why would Roger Stone have allegedly continued to lie so long about being in contact with WikiLeaks if either he (a) never was or (b) the contacts were entirely routine and above-board? Mueller, though, says Stone “falsely denied possessing records that contained evidence of these interactions,” a phrase that seems to indicate much more. How did Donald Trump and the Trump Organization react to the progress of the Trump Tower Moscow project? Michael Cohen’s plea agreement only lays out that the president’s former lawyer and fixer repeatedly briefed Trump and members of the Trump Organization’s leadership on his progress on the Trump Tower Moscow project. But he stops short of saying anything about how the Trump team reacted—or what instructions, if any, they gave Cohen. Mueller also points out in Cohen’s plea that Cohen appears to have scuttled a trip to Russia to work on the deal on the very day that the DNC announced it had been hacked, odd timing at least. Who directed Michael Flynn’s conversations with Sergey Kislyak? There remains much to understand about former national security advisor Michael Flynn’s plea agreement, which states that he lied to FBI agents about conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition. Two things, in particular, stand out in the facts of the case: First, that his contacts with Kislyak were directed by a “very senior member” of the Trump transition, an official identified in media reports as Jared Kushner, and second, if Flynn truly believed that he’d been properly directed by the president-elect or his designee to have the communications with Kislyak, why would he lie about them? Mueller has provided no answers yet here, either. But it’s worth noting, again, the oddity of Flynn’s aborted sentencing at the end of last year—where the judge, privy to more information than the public has, exploded at Flynn and finally prompted him to postpone the sentencing. What more is there in the Flynn case that’s worth knowing? Why did Manafort turn over polling data to Konstantin Klimink? And what are Konstantin Kilimnik’s ties to Russian intelligence? Mueller’s court filings have laid out that the special counsel believes that Kilimnik, Paul Manafort’s business partner and codefendant, had ties to Russian intelligence in 2016. Yet we haven’t seen evidence of why Mueller believes that—and, more important, what relevance that has to the Trump campaign. And we have only learned about the polling data from Manafort’s ongoing tech foibles, so why hasn’t Mueller brought that charge into the open yet? Why the “first time”? In last summer’s GRU indictment, Mueller seemed to say more than he needed to—just like he did with “was directed” in the Stone indictment—in pointing out that “on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office.” Mueller doesn’t note in the document that this was the same day Trump invited Russia to hack Clinton’s email, but in writing about the day Mueller adds two seemingly unnecessary details—first that the GRU did it “after hours,” which accounting for the time difference would mean after Trump’s campaign trail comments, and second, that the attack on Clinton’s email directly was “for the first time,” a fact that Mueller would have to prove in a trial, meaning that he has evidence that makes him confident that the action was new in Russia’s strategy. Mueller’s only making his own potential case and evidentiary burden higher by singling out “after hours” and “for the first time,” so that obviously must mean something to his prosecuting team. Mueller is clearly picking and choosing his charges carefully, so far. But there’s a lot more he’s not telling us, and if you add up all those missing puzzle pieces, it certainly seems possible—perhaps even probable—that Mueller is building towards a conspiracy indictment that he’s already told us about, one that brings together many of these open threads and players into one coherent narrative. In thinking through what that might look like, it’s worth remembering the second paragraph of his indictment last July, the case that targeted the GRU officials, which lays out three distinct stages of alleged conspiracy: Hacking the Democratic computers, stealing documents, and then “stag[ing] releases” to “interfere” with the election. The latter could easily encompass some of the actions already described in the Stone indictment. The “who” and “why” of that broader conspiracy remain open questions, but it’s notable the extent to which so many threads of the Russia story increasingly appear to overlap. For instance, Russian lawyer Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a key player in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, was charged earlier this year with obstruction relating to a separate, older money laundering case relating to her role in helping Prevezon Holdings, an entity owned by Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv. Buzzfeed reported this week that one of the other attendees at that Trump Tower meeting, a former Russian soldier and current lobbyist named Rinat Akhmetshin, “received a large payment that bank investigators deemed suspicious from Denis Katsyv.” So here we have Veselnitskaya, the lawyer from Prevezon Holdings, helping to organize a meeting at Trump Tower, while one of the other attendees received money contemporaneously from the same entity. Each revelation from Mueller and the other investigations around Trump appears actually to point in a consistent direction: A relatively small and regularly overlapping circle of people, both American and Russian, constantly lying and covering up their contacts together. Now, we’re just waiting for Mueller to tell us precisely why—and who. Garrett M.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.
