Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., outside her office in the Longworth House Office Building on Feb. 11. She is one of the first Muslim members of Congress and has received death threats. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Law enforcement discovered a cache of ammunition and illegal guns in the New York home of a man arrested after threatening to shoot Rep. Ilhan Omar, federal prosecutors say. Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., 55, is said to have called the office of the Minnesota congresswoman in March to threaten her life and repeat an anti-Muslim conspiracy theory. “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a [expletive] terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her [expletive] skull,” Carlineo said in the call, according to the U.S. Attorney General’s Office. Omar, along with fellow freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, is one of the first Muslim women in history to be elected to Congress. [FBI investigating assassination threat against Rep. Omar scrawled on gas station bathroom stall] During a police search of Carlineo’s Steuben County home, officers confiscated six firearms, including an AK-47 and a .45-caliber handgun, federal prosecutors said in a bail hearing Monday, local CBS affiliate WROC reported. Carlineo was charged with threatening to assault and murder a United States official, a story on the station’s website said. The guns were owned illegally, because Carlineo was previously convicted of a felony, WROC reported. Prosecutors say the alleged death threat to Omar’s office was made on the afternoon of March 21. Carlineo’s attorney argued that what was said in the call, which was not recorded, is in dispute. Carlineo maintains he said, “If our forefathers were still alive, they would put a bullet in [Omar’s] skull,” according to Rochester First. The alleged call, traced to Carlineo’s girlfriend, was made before a recent surge in death threats to Omar. Those threats followed a video tweeted by President Donald Trump that interspersed remarks she made to a Muslim civil rights organization with footage from the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bernie-sanders-override-trump-yemen-veto---split---Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is asking colleagues to support overriding the Yemen resolution veto. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump’s veto of a joint resolution to put an end to U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is going to kick the matter back to senators when they return to the Capitol next week. With recess continuing this week, senators are in their home states, on congressional delegations abroad and on the presidential campaign trail. But Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders , one of the many Democratic presidential candidates, took a moment Monday to circulate a dear colleague letter seeking support for overriding the Trump veto. “For far too long Congress, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role with regard to the authorization of war,” Sanders wrote to his Senate colleagues. “The historic passage of this resolution, the first time since the 1973 War Powers Resolution was passed that it has been successfully used to withdraw the United States from an unauthorized war, was a long overdue step by Congress to reassert that authority.” “The Congress must now act to protect that constitutional responsibility by overriding the president’s veto,” Sanders wrote. Sanders, who has been out on the presidential campaign trail himself, wrote in the letter that supporters of the American involvement in Saudi Arabia’s Yemen campaign should seek a floor debate and and vote on that effort. The resolution gained significant momentum last year in the aftermath of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. ICYMI: Trump Suggests ‘Rogue Killers’ Could Be Responsible for Saudi Journalist's Death The Senate is likely going to have to take up the veto override vote, though given that the underlying resolution only passed with a 54-46 vote under an expedited process, it its not expected to prevail. There are a number of procedural options available to senators for dispensing with veto messages. Motions to refer the president’s message to committee or to table the matter entirely are possible (though unlikely to work given the support of a majority of senators for the resolution itself). While it’s unusual to try to force a cloture vote on a veto override effort, it would be possible to debate the Yemen resolution to death since the 60 votes needed for cloture is a greater number than the number of senators supporting the joint resolution. The most straightforward way to dispense with the Yemen resolution would be to reach a unanimous consent agreement to set up a direct vote on overriding the Trump veto, which would require 67 votes if all of the senators are in attendance that day. The president’s message, which was released oh April 16, contends that the War Powers resolution is not necessary since U.S. troops are not directly engaged in Yemen except for possible counter-terrorism operations. Trump’s message also said that the proposed restrictions would would be dangerous and counterproductive to foreign policy. “The Congress should not seek to prohibit certain tactical operations, such as in-flight refueling, or require military engagements to adhere to arbitrary timelines,” the message said. “Doing so would interfere with the President’s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, and could endanger our service members by impairing their ability to efficiently and effectively conduct military engagements and to withdraw in an orderly manner at the appropriate time.” Regardless, the Democratic-led House of Representatives in not expected to ever get a chance to see the veto message, since it’s on a joint resolution that was first introduced in the Senate.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/florida-man-threatens-to-kill-reps-tlaib-swalwell-and-sen-booker---split---Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., was among three Democratic lawmakers who recently received death threats by voicemail at their D.C. offices. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) A Florida man was arrested Friday after police said he threatened to kill three Democratic lawmakers: Reps. Eric Swalwell and Rashida Tlaib, as well as Sen. Cory Booker. John Joseph Kless, 49, was charged in the Southern District of Florida with making threatening communications, after he apparently left death threats by voicemail in the lawmakers’ Washington offices. [Rep. Hunter pretends to cross the Mexico border and gets called out for violating ‘parole’] He is accused of using incessant profanity and racism in each call, referring to Tlaib, a Muslim, as “Taliban” and “towel head,” while he called Booker, an African American, a “monkey” and the N-word. In the messages for the three lawmakers, Kless is quoted as having made numerous racist references to a fourth member of Congress who had made comments about 9/11. It’s clear that he was talking about Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Tell your Taliban friend to shut the f--- up about 9/1 1, this ain’t Trump’s fault, b----, it’s all your people’s fault. You’re the motherf------ who drove the planes into the buildings, b----,” he said in a voicemail left for Tlaib, according to federal court documents. [Atheist prayers can be barred by House chaplain, appeals court says] Swalwell, who recently announced his bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, said he was grateful to the Capitol Police and Florida law enforcement for protecting him. “Threatening violence is the lowest form of communication and has no place in our community,” the California Democrat said. Booker, who is also running for president in 2020, declined to comment on the matter. The arrest was, in part, made because Tlaib was scheduled to speak in Florida between April 21-22, according to the affidavit. Her office didn’t immediately respond with comment. The Capitol Police also found that Kless called Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s D.C. office in February and left a profane voicemail about “taking away his guns, abortion, illegal immigration, and Muslims in Congress,” according to the affidavit.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.latimes.com/local/education/#nt=secondarynavbar---split---Nipsey Hussle was embedded in the Hyde Park community and spent time at schools in the area. Because of that involvement, students are experiencing his death in a more personal way than just as music fans. Juniors are taking the SAT test for free in schools across Los Angeles for the first time. The Los Angeles Unified School District is having every junior take the exam during the school day. Officials hope the effort will get more students to go to college. As pressure mounts on politicians to rethink California's charter school policies, all eyes are on Gov. Gavin Newsom. Is the new governor interested in tackling one of the state's thorniest issues? Hit hard by the recession and declining enrollment, some of California's smallest school districts have been approving charter schools in exchange for fees. The practice, which is legal, has given districts an incentive not to monitor misbehaving charters. California’s charter law — passed in 1992 — allowed for charter schools to be authorized and overseen by hundreds of school districts. It also allowed for multiple appeals if schools were denied. Clark and Jeanette Parker were charter operators who used all the choices to make millions. Top colleges have poured resources into recruiting and supporting low-income students, and their efforts have shown results. But the recent admissions scandal paints a much different picture in the public eye. UC's decision to table a vote on raising nonresident tuition comes after students and some regents expressed concern that doing so could limit diversity and hurt some immigrants. University of California President Janet Napolitano has ordered an investigation into UC involvement in the nationwide college cheating scam that has ensnared dozens of wealthy families. William J. Johnston, who steered L.A. Unified through stormy integration battles during his long tenure as superintendent, has died at 92. As ballots continue to be counted, Heather Repenning has edged ahead of Graciela Ortiz in the contest to see who will face front-runner Jackie Goldberg in a May 14 runoff for a pivotal seat on the Los Angeles Board of Education. A Los Angeles jury on Thursday ordered the El Monte Union High School District to pay $2 million to the family of a student who was sexually molested by her teacher. Eli Broad on Tuesday, election day, gave $100,000 to a PAC that supported Heather Repenning in the race to fill an open seat on the L.A. school board. Some student leaders criticized the announcement by UC President Janet Napolitano, saying nonresidents should not have to pay higher tuition either. The education system designed to serve low-income students is increasingly too expensive for them to attend, according to a new study that found nearly 20% of California community college students are homeless. More than 120 faculty members at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College are demanding the ouster of President Laurence Frank, who they say has failed to address scandals over grade fraud and alleged misuse of federal funds. Jackie Goldberg leads in early returns in an election to fill a Los Angeles Board of Education seat left vacant when Ref Rodriguez resigned after pleading guilty to breaking campaign-finance laws. A prominent former dean at Loyola Marymount University is accused of firing a campus whistleblower to hide alleged financial improprities, according to claims in a lawsuit filed Monday. Ten people are running to replace Ref Rodriguez as the Los Angeles Board of Education member for District 5. Former First Lady Michelle Obama will visit UCLA in May to headline her national celebration of all high school seniors and transfer students who commit to higher education. The race to fill an LAUSD school board seat — which follows a six-day teachers strike — could tip the balance between charter-school and teachers-union supporters. The future of L.A. schools Supt. Austin Beutner also could be affected. The seat opened up after Ref Rodriguez resigned. University of California cancels its subscription to mega-publisher Elsevier after what it calls a blow for free access to publicly funded research. In the wake of a Los Angeles teachers' strike that attracted popular support, the Board of Education will ask voters in June to raise their taxes in support schools. How kids get to school safely Information about violence near schools and what help is available for teens and their families. After the six-day teachers' strike in January, Los Angeles school officials have changed course and decided to ask local voters to support a school parcel tax. But there's not a lot of time left to convince L.A. residents. Even as crime has dropped in L.A., thousands of children grow up with a constant drumbeat of death. California State University's controversial reforms eliminating non-credit remedial courses have helped thousands more students pass college-level math classes and move closer to a degree, new data show. Oakland teachers went on strike Thursday over class size, nurses, salary and charter schools. It was the second teachers strike in California this year. Keith Brown, the Oakland union president, said teachers’ strikes in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the country energized Oakland teachers and showed them a path toward winning concessions he says are crucial to offering a strong public education. An L.A. school board member is pressing for a deeper look into what consultants are telling Supt. Austin Beutner about how to fix the nation's second-largest school system. Los Angeles school officials have released the secret contracts of senior advisers to Supt. Austin Beutner on his L.A. Unified restructuring plan. Colleges and universities across California are scrambling to revise their Title IX procedures after a state appellate court ruled that accused students have a right to a hearing and to cross examine their accusers. The Los Angeles Community College District acted properly in selecting a manager for its multi-billion construction bond measure program, a judge has ruled, dismissing allegations of unfair treatment by the losing bidder. The winner of the L.A. County academic decathlon is West High of Torrance. They now know more about the 1960s than their older relatives who lived through that decade. The governor has asked state schools Supt. Tony Thurmond to convene an expert panel to study the impact that charter schools have on school districts. Copyright © 2019, Los Angeles Times
---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/my-search-for-boyhood-friend-led-to-dark-discovery/---split---Includes: Some writers used to drink when the words didn't come. Now we have the internet. Whenever I get stuck writing, instead of sliding open the bottom drawer with the whiskey bottle, I load up The New York Times or Politico, check my email, or, when all else fails, start Googling old acquaintances. Most of us have done it. What ever happened to that bucktoothed kid from third grade? There he is, grinning at you from the computer screen—balding, paunchy, mustachioed—and you're reading about his lake cottage, his wood-turning hobby, his Danube cruise, his grandchildren, his cats. A few months ago, as I was staring at a wretched chapter I was trying to write, I idly Googled the name “Peter Anderson” and “New Jersey.” Petey was my best friend growing up in Wellesley, Massachusetts, until he moved to New Jersey in seventh grade. But his was a common name, and it returned tens of thousands of hits. Slumped in my chair, continuing to waste time, I tried his mother's name, his father's, and his brother's. There were just too many Andersons, though, and nothing of note surfaced, beyond an old article in The Times of Trenton about a murder. This obviously wasn't my friend Petey: Dozens of other Peter Andersons in New Jersey were probably alive and well and going about their business. Petey lived across the brook from me in a white stucco house overlooking a golf course owned by Wellesley College. He was a droll kid with pale orange hair and papery skin through which you could see blue veins. He had a cheerful mother and a silent, raddle-faced alcoholic father. After work, his father parked himself in a wing chair in the living room, shook out the afternoon Boston Herald, and read it while gripping a scotch on the rocks. When he wanted another, he jiggled the empty glass and Mrs. Anderson hurried in with fresh ice and the bottle. In those days before the curated childhood, Petey and I ran wild, concerning ourselves with knocking on doors and running away, getting chased off the golf course by greenskeepers, playing stickball, making crank calls, and hunting for buried treasure. We dug holes in the woods behind the golf course, hoping to unearth a sack of pine tree shillings from colonial days or gold doubloons from the time when Captain Kidd (so we fantasized) sailed his ship up the Charles River. One Young Boy's Magnificent Obsession With Fans A Deadly Hunt for Hidden Treasure Spawns an Online Mystery The Curse of the Bahia Emerald, a Giant Green Rock That Ruins Lives One fall day, my mother gave me an empty cookie tin with a picture of a great ship plowing through waves, surrounded by gulls. Petey came over, and I said, “Let's fill this with treasure and bury it.” We decided to leave it in the ground for 10 years and dig it up when we were 18. The year was 1964. Petey and I spent hours debating what to put in the tin. The treasure had to be something valuable enough that our grown-up selves would be glad to have it back. We gathered our best things and laid them out on my bed for inspection. Most of them struck us as childish junk, but a few stood out as objects with adult gravitas. I chose a Morgan silver dollar, a coiled-up trilobite fossil, and my finest arrowhead—an ancient beauty flaked out of petrified wood in which you could still see the tree rings. Among Petey's treasures were a squirrel skull, a miniature brass cannon from the USS Constitution's gift shop, and an intricate blob of lead he had made by melting fishing sinkers on the stove and pouring the molten metal into water. It was a method of telling the future, he said. The blob predicted that his life would be one of wealth, success, and happiness. As we looked over our carefully assembled treasures, they still didn't seem adequate for a great journey into the future. I had an idea: Why not each write the story of our lives? Whatever else we put in the tin, we knew this would make for good reading, especially if we'd forgotten our childhoods, like most adults we knew. Every afternoon for several weeks, we gathered in Petey's living room and labored over legal pads, sharpening and resharpening our pencils until the flakes lay in tiny curls all around us on the carpet. I called my opus “The Story of My Life So Far.” I remember writing about riding horses in Wyoming and living with a Luo family in the African bush, eating ram guts and ugali for supper and listening to the lions roar at night. (I had eccentric parents.) Petey called his “Eight Years Old and Full of Beans,” a title I criticized as corny, but he stuck with it. I didn't read his story and he didn't read mine; that would happen 10 years hence. When we were done, we rolled up the papers, tied them with ribbons, and sealed them with wax. We carefully packed the tin, then wrapped it in layers and layers of duct tape so it would be waterproof. I wondered: When we dug it up, who would we be? What would America look like? Would there be flying cars and men on the moon? Would we all be Reds, as my teacher said was going to happen if people didn't wake up? Would the world be a cinder from nuclear war? The future was strange, scary, and thrilling to ponder. The crucial question arose as to where to bury the tin. It had to be a far-off place where anyone could find it; that was part of the excitement. We settled on an abandoned field deep in the woods at the farthest edge of the Wellesley College property. One fine fall day, equipped with a compass, pick, and shovel, Petey and I headed out. The maples had turned scarlet, and the leaves, backlit by the sun, glowed like church glass against a blue sky. Once at the field, we put down the shovel and pick and scoped out the scene. We decided on a hollow oak as our starting point. Standing at the foot of the oak, I sighted into the field with my compass. Due west, in the middle of the field, stood a cedar sapling. We paced the distance through weeds and grass, picking the cockleburs off our socks: 21 paces. Having established that distance, we then measured nine paces due north. I sank the shovel into the ground and cut a rectangle in the tough grass. We worked off the turf in a single piece and laid it aside. Wielding the pick, I broke up the dirt while Petey shoveled it out, piling it nearby. In 20 minutes we had prepared a most excellent hole, 2 feet deep, which cut through the upper layer of loam into a stratum of orange clay. We placed the tin inside and snugged it down tight. Petey backfilled the hole and smacked down the dirt with the back of the shovel. We replanted the grass on top, brushed it out with our fingers, and threw the remaining clods of dirt into the woods. A dozen artfully placed autumn leaves completed the picture. Up to that point in my life, time had given me everything I had; I was now starting to realize it also took things away. We shook hands and promised to come back in 10 years. I drew a treasure map showing the oak tree, the field, and the cedar tree, with dotted lines indicating the number of paces and directions, leading to where an X marked the spot. I made a copy of the map for Petey and locked mine in a tin safe hidden behind a secret panel in my room. There it remained as the years rolled by. In seventh grade, Petey moved away to New Jersey. We were both devastated by the separation. We wrote long letters to each other, some so fat they had to be rolled up and mailed in a tube. But over the course of a year, the letters lost weight and became sickly, and finally our friendship passed away peacefully in its sleep. The treasure was almost—but not quite—forgotten. When I was 16, while rummaging through some old stuff, I found the map still hidden in the safe. I stared at it, thinking of my long-lost pal. We had promised to wait until 1974, but I hadn't seen Petey in years, and it felt like an eternity had passed since we buried the tin. The years between 8 and 16 are mighty indeed. Since Petey had left, I figured the promises we had made to each other were no longer valid, and I would be justified in digging up the box by myself, two years before its time. I got a shovel out of the garage and, map in hand, set off. My days of roaming the woods were over, but I still knew the land by heart. When I reached the location of the field, however, I was shocked to discover it no longer existed. It had rejoined the forest, growing into a thicket of red cedars, oaks, and birches. I found the hollow oak. But when I stood at its base and trained my compass west, I couldn't identify the cedar tree. There were dozens of cedars of varying sizes, some 10 feet tall or more, clustered in a dense stand. I measured out 21 paces, trying to approximate the length of an 8-year-old's stride. Pushing through the branches, I arrived at a tree that, because it seemed to be the biggest, might have been the one we used as a landmark. From there, following the compass, I measured nine paces north, halted, and began to dig. It was hard going, hacking through mats of crisscrossing roots. After a while I hit softer dirt and the digging got easier. Down, down I dug, well into the orange layer, finding nothing. I paced it off again and dug another hole. Nothing. I dug a third, then a fourth. Resentment mingled with a keen sense of loss. Up to that point in my life, time had given me everything I had; I was now starting to realize it also took things away. The Preston family in 1963, with the author in the center. Over the years, thoughts of Petey drifted through my mind at random moments. An old friend said he'd heard Petey was cleaning swimming pools somewhere, and that he was gay, but I didn't get around to digging deeper. That's where things would have remained, but for the constant temptation of the internet. Now, at 62 years of age, I was frivolously Googling away, trying to find out what someone I knew more than half a century ago was up to, and having no success. And then I remembered a crucial detail: Petey's middle name was Stark. This was enough to refine the search—and up popped that same article in The Times of Trenton. On May 2, 2011, the newspaper said, the body of a Peter Anderson was found in a boarding house in Ewing, New Jersey. The man's hands and feet were bound with packing tape. He had apparently been bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Curiously, Petey's middle name appeared nowhere in the article. It seemed that the search engine had turned over an arbitrary stone. Still, I was deeply troubled. I couldn't seem to verify that the murder victim wasn't Petey. Realizing I wasn't going to get any work done until I knew for sure, I spent $9.95 on an Intelius search of public records. It revealed that Peter Stark Anderson, son of Virginia and Perry Anderson, of Hightstown, New Jersey, was deceased, and that the date of his death was May 2, 2011. The murder victim was my friend Petey. I felt as though I had been suddenly poisoned; my insides seized up. Gripped by a feeling of nausea, I began reading the other stories about the homicide, of which there were half a dozen. The police had quickly identified a suspect, a man named Robert Horrocks Jr., who had been working as a handyman at the boarding house where Petey lived. Horrocks had fled to Connecticut the night of the killing. His blood-stained clothes were recovered, and he was brought back to New Jersey and charged with murder. At his bail reduction hearing, the newspaper reported, his attorney contended that Horrocks had killed Petey while defending himself in a fight. Horrocks interrupted him and insisted on speaking. The judge, obliging, warned him of his rights. Horrocks then said, “I know I'm guilty of the crime.” At his sentencing, Horrocks went on to tell the court why he was justified in killing Petey. While doing repairs at the boarding house, he said, he had brought along his girlfriend's autistic adult son, whom Petey had sexually assaulted. I forced myself to read on, stupefied with disbelief. Horrocks returned weeks later to take revenge. “I did what I had to do,” he reportedly said. “I didn't mean to kill the guy, but he ended up dying and I'm paying for it. End of story.” According to The Times, the prosecutor questioned Horrocks' account. Nobody, she said, could corroborate his story of a sexual assault, including the autistic man himself. Furthermore, the prosecutor continued, Horrocks knew the son had been molested years before by another man. “The story was out there ripe for the picking, and I suspect the defendant latched onto it as a justification,” she said. Horrocks was sentenced to 30 years in prison without possibility of parole. The story left my mind in a state of complete disorder. As a boy, Petey had been terrified of violence. Being frail and gentle, he was the target of bullying—shoulder bumping (ex-cuse me!), tripping, popping of shirt loops, taunts of “faggot,” and smacking upside the head. He fled from any hint of conflict, usually with a wiseass comment flung over his shoulder, and he could outrun any goofus who took up the chase. I couldn't begin to fathom the trajectory that brought him from an upper-upper-middle-class home in Wellesley to a cramped boarding house in New Jersey. Details of his life came flickering back into my memory: Petey singing songs to his hamster Gertrude; Petey cradling his dying dog after she'd been hit by a car, even though she was bleeding and peeing all over him; Petey writing silly stories about a magical valley where the animals talked like people; Petey and I burying a treasure. My feckless Googling had reaped a monstrous reality that I knew was going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I asked myself: Is there something righteous in facing reality, or would it have been better to stay ignorant? A surfeit of ugly knowledge is a feature of our age, a result of the internet carrying to our doorstep, like a tomcat with a dead rat, all manner of brutal information. How many others have flippantly Googled an old friend and discovered something ghastly? This was not knowledge as power; it was knowledge as sorrow. But I was not done. I had to know what happened. I started digging again. I got contact information for the prosecutor, the public defender, the judge, and the journalist who wrote The Times stories. I got the telephone number, address, and email address of Petey's brother, living in Massachusetts. I lined up all that information, printed it out, and squared it off on the corner of my desk. It was everything I needed to find the answer. I stared at it for weeks—and then I threw it out. In a world verminous with information, there are some things I just don't want to know. A month or two later, when I had at least minimally processed Petey's murder, I did undertake one final bit of research. Using Google Earth, I looked at the abandoned field where we buried the treasure. It had grown into solid forest—wild, tangled, thick, a small wilderness in suburbia. After 55 years, the tin containing Petey's life story, my prized arrowhead, and a lying lump of lead is still there, continuing its long, dark journey into the future.

Andy Earl/Courtesy of the artist hide caption A year after lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died, the remaining members of The Cranberries, Mike Hogan, Noel Hogan and Fergal Lawler, honor her with the band's last album, In The End. Rock fans fell in love with The Cranberries in the early '90s, thanks, in large part, to the haunting, Celtic-inspired voice of the Irish rock band's lead singer, Dolores O'Riordan. The Cranberries, made up of O'Riordan on lead vocal, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler on drums, created an intoxicating juxtaposition of grunge and alternative pop, with O'Riordan's lilting lyrics searing through right in. Between her measured vocal power, her honest, vulnerable songwriting and her Irish accent peaking through every syllable sung, O'Riordan helped The Cranberries stand out. O'Riordan died suddenly in January 2018 at 46 years old and left behind the vocal tracks to what was intended to be the band's latest album. Now, O'Riordan's bandmates have decided to complete that album, In The End — the last album the band will release — in her memory. The Cranberries' In The End is due out on Friday. Noel Hogan still remembers the day O'Riordan auditioned to be in the band. The guys were looking for a new singer at the time and O'Riordan came in a timid teenager. "She was so small and quiet," Hogan says. "Then she opened her mouth and this amazing voice, this huge voice came out for the size of her." Hogan knew immediately that she was who they were looking for. The Cranberries' debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? was released in 1993, propelled by the smash hit "Linger," written by O'Riordan and Hogan. The band rocketed into worldwide stardom, releasing four more albums and solidifying its success with songs like "Zombie" before taking a hiatus in 2004. In June 2017, O'Riordan and Hogan started emailing album ideas and demos back and forth to each other. O'Riordan had been very open about her struggles with mental health and addiction, which would affect the band at times, but they wanted to make a new album. Hogan says that when they were emailing those demos, she was in a good place. They started laying down her demos. Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries performs at L'Olympia May 2017 in Paris.

David Wolff-Patrick/Redferns/Getty Images hide caption Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries performs at L'Olympia May 2017 in Paris. According to Cranberries member Noel Hogan, he and O'Riordan started emailing album ideas in June 2017. "All of that was kind of behind her," Hogan says. "She's kind of found a way to cope with the mental health thing. That's why she wanted to write so much. That's what she kept saying, 'I have so much to say, I just need the music to put it to.' " Hogan says O'Riordan's apparent stability is what made her death even more tragic and devastating. (Officials ruled O'Riordan's cause of death to be accidental drowning due to alcohol intoxication.) But after a period of mourning, the remaining band members remembered they still had O'Riordan's demos. As Hogan remembers, they finally had the courage to start listening to them again in late February and, with her family's permission, started recording in April. "We spoke to her family and said, 'Look, how do you feel about us finishing the album?' And they were really supportive," Lawler says. "They were delighted, actually. They gave us their blessing." Hogan says, in a sense, they were used to O'Riordan not being in the studio when they recorded — "Dolores hated hanging around the studio once we worked on our parts" — but, of course, this time was different. "It wasn't that long after Dolores had passed away," he explains. "So you had the emotions that were there: Very confused, 'Should I be doing this, should I not?' Every day you go in, you put on your headphones and there's Dolores, singing at you." The group also agreed that if they ever felt uncomfortable about making the album, they would stop production. After five months of work, the resulting album, In The End, is 11 songs of her legacy. Lyrically, you don't hear much of O'Riordan, but her vocals are so powerful, it feels like she's present throughout each song. The music of the album touches on many themes — abuse, love and expectations — but to Hogan and Lawler, the most important part of the project is that it represents the new beginning O'Riordan wanted for herself. "A lot of the songs, when people listen to them, they're going to hear a lot of subject matter that's about things ending and things being over," Hogan says. "That's what she's referring to — that point in her life where things had been not so great. She felt that was behind her, and this was a new chapter." Vince Pearson edited this story for broadcast.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jaime-brienne-game-of-thrones_n_5cbdd145e4b06605e3f1608c---split---The most recent episode of “Game of Thrones” Season 8 was a celebration of characters ― characters we’ve come to know and love over the course of nearly eight seasons. But perhaps no one person is as universally beloved as Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie), the loyal warrior who has fearlessly defended Stark women since Season 2. In a standout moment from “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” the season’s second installment, she finally got her due ― being knighted by her friend (and would-be boyfriend) Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an intimate ceremony before a group of men that included her dedicated squire, Podrick (Daniel Portman). “Is this the first time we see Brienne smile and be happy? It was beautiful,” Coster-Waldau told HuffPost during a phone call on Monday evening. “There’s something about that atmosphere: You have the lightness of Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju‎) telling his insane story and then you have the beauty of his honesty. There’s no bullshit, if you will. When he asks Brienne why she isn’t a knight and she says women can’t be because of tradition, he says, ‘Fuck tradition.’ And that rings a bell with Jaime because it’s the truth. She is clearly the most honorable, the most worthy of the title of knight of anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.” Clearly there is a strong connection between Jaime and Brienne, who went through a transformative journey together in Seasons 2 and 3 as Brienne escorted Jaime, then Catelyn Stark’s (Michelle Fairley) prisoner, back to King’s Landing in exchange for the safety of Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Maisie Williams). During their ordeal, Jaime loses a hand protecting Brienne against assaulters and even saves her from being dramatically mauled by a bear. Of course, once they’re back in the capital, his power-hungry sister and lover Cersei (Lena Headey) throws cold water on their growing friendship. But before Brienne leaves in pursuit of the missing Sansa and Arya ― who went missing from King’s Landing ― Jaime arms her with a Valyrian steel sword she dubs Oathkeeper. Coster-Waldau says that moment as well as the knighting scene in the latest episode, is a “weird love letter” Jaime leaves for Brienne. “When he gave her Oathkeeper, she comes to give it back and he says, ‘No, it’s yours. It’s always been yours.’ It’s easy to read into it that he’s talking about more than just the sword,” the actor said. Oathkeeper, however, is very important. Not only is it a powerful weapon against the wights, it is also one of two swords reforged from House Stark’s greatsword, Ice, which landed in Lannister possession after Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) orders it to be used to behead its owner Ned (Sean Bean) in Season 1. Then, Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance) gives one of the reforged weapons to Jaime and the other to Joffrey in Season 4. But Jaime, being the honorable man he has become, gives his to Brienne as a sign of respect for her quest to protect the Stark girls. He then inherits Joffrey’s weapon, named Widow’s Wail, after the king’s death. This is all to say that Brienne and Jaime have sister swords, and they’re going to use them in the battle against the Night King and his army. When asked about the significance of their swords, Coster-Waldau paused a bit, thinking over his response before admitting, “I’m starting to get into deep water here.” “Hopefully, the horrors that were done to the Starks will come to good,” he added. “But I don’t want to talk about deeper meanings when we still have a few episodes to go. Things will be revealed and certain things won’t, but obviously, there’s meaning. Will it have special meaning in the future? Who knows. But it has meaning in the fact that the Stark children, the girls, were given this sword that was made from Ned Stark’s sword to protect them.” It also wasn’t lost on Coster-Waldau that many of the Valyrian steel swords have been passed to different Houses ― Brienne and Jaime now have House Stark’s Ice, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) has House Mormont’s Longclaw, Jorah (Iain Glen) has House Tarly’s Heartsbane, and Arya has an unnamed dagger (sometimes referred to as the Catspaw Dagger) that once belonged to the late Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen). While he wouldn’t admit to any potential spoilers, but Coster-Waldau did tell us, “The whole point is that we have to do this together if we want to survive, and I think that’s one way of reading it, for sure. It is ‘The Song of Ice and Fire,’ it’s the way it should be.” Speaking of that icy, fiery song, could it be that ― considering everything we now know about Jon Snow, aka Aegon Targaryen ― Brienne and Jaime are the ice to Jon and Daenerys’ (Emilia Clarke) fire? (Forget about the White Walkers!) “Yeah,” Coster-Waldau told HuffPost, laughing and adding, “Dany didn’t seem too happy about finding out she was related to her lover.” He continued, “I love how it’s not at all about them being related and having sex ― clearly that’s not a big deal. But she’s like, ‘What? Are you going to fucking claim my throne?! Is that it?’” No matter who ends up on the Iron Throne, death is coming, that much is for sure. And Jaime wants to be standing next to Brienne when it does. “She likes Jaime Lannister, and she believes in him and the goodness in him, and he absolutely admires and believes in Brienne of Tarth,” Coster-Waldau explained. “I love that he goes to her and says, ‘Listen, I would be honored to serve under your command.’ He’s letting down all his guards and [saying] this is the truth. The truth is I want to be close to you for many reasons but first and foremost, you’re the best. Jaime says himself he’s not the knight he used to be. That golden hand is not efficient when it comes to fighting these undead creatures, and he wants to be close to her when they face death.”

According to a confidential Navy criminal investigation report obtained by The New York Times, they gave him the bloody details and asked for a formal investigation. But instead of launching an investigation that day, the troop commander and his senior enlisted aide — both longtime comrades of the accused platoon leader, Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher — warned the seven platoon members that speaking out could cost them and others their careers, according to the report. The clear message, one of the seven told investigators, was “Stop talking about it.” The platoon members eventually forced the referral of their concerns to authorities outside the SEALs, and Chief Gallagher now faces a court-martial, with his trial set to begin May 28. But the account of the March 2018 meeting and myriad other details in the 439-page report paint a disturbing picture of a subculture within the SEALs that prized aggression, even when it crossed the line, and that protected wrongdoers. According to the investigation report, the troop commander, Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, said in the meeting that while the SEALs were free to report the killings, the Navy might not look kindly on rank-and-file team members making allegations against a chief. Their careers could be sidetracked, he said, and their elite status revoked; referring to the eagle-and-trident badges worn by SEALs, he said the Navy “will pull your birds.” The enlisted aide, Master Chief Petty Officer Brian Alazzawi, warned them that the “frag radius” — the area damaged by an explosion — from a war-crime investigation of Chief Gallagher could be wide enough to take down a lot of other SEALs as well, the report said. [For more stories about the changing nature of warfare, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Navy SEALs are regarded as the most elite commando force in the American military. But that reputation has been blotted repeatedly in recent years by investigations of illegal beatings, killings and theft, and reports of drug use in the ranks. In January, the top commander of the SEALs, Rear Adm. Collin Green, ordered a 90-day review of the force’s culture and training; the results have not yet been made public. As Chief Gallagher’s men were sounding an alarm about killings in Iraq, his superiors were lavishing praise on him. An evaluation quoted in the investigation report called Chief Gallagher the best chief of the 12 in the team, and said, “This is the man I want leading SEALs in combat.” A few days after the March 2018 meeting, the chief was awarded a Bronze Star for valor under fire in Iraq. A month later, the seven platoon members finally succeeded in spurring their commanders to formally report the killings of the three Iraqis to the Navy Criminal Investigation Service, by threatening to go directly to top Navy brass and to the news media. Chief Gallagher was arrested in September on more than a dozen charges, including premeditated murder and attempted murder. If convicted, he could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denies all the charges. The chief’s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said the Navy investigation report, which was first reported by Navy Times, does not offer an accurate account of what happened in Iraq. He said that hundreds of additional pages of evidence, sealed by the court, included interviews with platoon members who said the chief never murdered anyone. At the same time, some conservatives have rallied to Chief Gallagher’s defense, raising money and pressing publicly for his release. Chief Gallagher, through Mr. Parlatore, declined to be interviewed for this article. The Navy has charged Chief Gallagher’s immediate superior, Lt. Jacob Portier, with failing to report the chief’s possibly criminal actions and with destroying evidence. Lieutenant Portier has pleaded not guilty. Through his lawyer, he, too, declined to be interviewed. The investigation report indicates that a number of other high-ranking SEALs also knew of the allegations against the chief, and did not report them. But no one else has been charged in the case. Chief Gallagher learned of the March 2018 meeting soon after it happened, the report indicates, and he began working to turn other SEALs against the accusers. “I just got word these guys went crying to the wrong person,” Chief Gallagher wrote to a fellow chief in one of hundreds of text messages included in the report. To another, he wrote: “The only thing we can do as good team guys is pass the word on those traitors. They are not brothers at all.” Citing his texts, the Navy kept the chief in the brig to await trial, saying it believed he had been trying to intimidate witnesses and undermine the investigation. He denies that accusation as well. The chief’s wife, Andrea Gallagher, and his brother, Sean Gallagher, have appeared repeatedly on Fox News and other news outlets, calling the chief a hero and demanding his release. They say the allegations against Chief Gallagher were concocted by disgruntled subordinates who could not meet his demanding standards and wanted to get rid of him. A website soliciting donations for his defense says it has raised $375,000, and a prominent veterans’ apparel maker is selling “Free Eddie” T-shirts. Spurred by the Gallagher family, 40 Republican members of Congress signed a letter in March calling for the Navy to free the chief pending trial, and soon after, President Trump said on Twitter that he would be moved to “less restrictive confinement.” Chief Gallagher was released from the brig and is now restricted to the Navy Medical Center in San Diego, according to a Navy spokeswoman. Ms. Gallagher did not respond to requests for comment. Chief Gallagher, who is 39 and goes by the nickname Blade, is known as a standout even among the elite SEALs. Over the course of five deployments with the SEALs, he was repeatedly recognized for valor and coolheaded leadership under fire. He is qualified as a medic, a sniper and an explosives expert, and has been an instructor at BUDS, the force’s grueling training program. To hundreds of sailors he trained, he was a battle-tested veteran who fed them war stories while pushing them through punishing workouts in the surf. Investigators’ interviews with more than a dozen members of Alpha Platoon, included in the Navy’s criminal investigation report, as well as other interviews with SEALs, offer a more troubling portrait of the chief. When Chief Gallagher took over leadership of the platoon in 2015, SEALs said, he already had a reputation as a “pirate” — an operator more interested in fighting terrorists than in adhering to the rules and making rank. A number of platoon members told investigators that at first they were excited to be led by a battle-hardened “legend,” but their opinion quickly shifted after they were deployed to Iraq in February 2017 to help retake Mosul from Islamic State fighters. The SEALs in the platoon did not respond to requests for interviews for this article. Their names and those of others who have not been identified publicly in court have been withheld from this article at the request of the Navy, because of the covert nature of their work. A spokeswoman for Naval Special Warfare, Cmdr. Tamara Lawrence, said that while they are commandos, SEALs are still expected to follow the same laws as all other troops, adding, “It’s called special operations, not different operations.” The investigation report said several members of the platoon told investigators that Chief Gallagher showed little regard for the safety of team members or the lives of civilians. Their mission was to advise Iraqi forces and provide assistance with snipers and drones, but they said the chief wanted instead to clear houses and start firefights. He would order them to take what seemed to be needless risks, and to fire rockets at houses for no apparent reason, they said. He routinely parked an armored truck on a Tigris River bridge and emptied the truck’s heavy machine gun into neighborhoods on the other side with no discernible targets, according to one senior SEAL. Chief Gallagher’s job was to plan and oversee missions for the platoon, but platoon members said he spent much of his time in a hidden perch with a sniper rifle, firing three or four times as often as other platoon snipers. They said he boasted about the number of people he had killed, including women. Photos from the deployment that were stored on a hard drive seized by the Navy show the chief aiming sniper rifles and rocket launchers from rooftops in the city. Two SEAL snipers told investigators that one day, from his sniper nest, Chief Gallagher shot a girl in a flower-print hijab who was walking with other girls on the riverbank. One of those snipers said he watched through his scope as she dropped, clutching her stomach, and the other girls dragged her away. Another day, two other snipers said, the chief shot an unarmed man in a white robe with a wispy white beard. They said the man fell, a red blotch spreading on his back. Before the 2017 deployment, Chief Gallagher ordered a hatchet and a hunting knife, both handmade by a SEAL veteran named Andrew Arrabito with whom he had served, text messages show. Hatchets have become an unofficial SEAL symbol, and some operators carry and use them on deployments. Chief Gallagher told Mr. Arrabito in a text message shortly after arriving in Iraq, “I’ll try and dig that knife or hatchet on someone’s skull!” On the morning of May 4, 2017, Iraqi troops brought in an Islamic State fighter who had been wounded in the leg in battle, SEALs told investigators, and Chief Gallagher responded over the radio with words to the effect of “he’s mine.” The SEALs estimated that the captive was about 15 years old. A video clip shows the youth struggling to speak, but SEAL medics told investigators that his wounds had not appeared life-threatening. A medic was treating the youth on the ground when Chief Gallagher walked up without a word and stabbed the wounded teenager several times in the neck and once in the chest with his hunting knife, killing him, two SEAL witnesses said. Iraqi officers who were at the scene told Navy investigators that they did not see the captive die, but disputed the stabbing account, saying it seemed out of character for the chief. Minutes after the death, Chief Gallagher and his commanding officer, Lieutenant Portier, gathered some nearby SEALs for a re-enlistment ceremony, snapping photos of the platoon standing over the body. In recent years, photos of re-enlistment ceremonies in unusual circumstances — while scuba diving or skydiving, for instance — have gone viral on social media. The chief’s variation would have reinforced his image as a hard-charging pirate, one SEAL said. A week later, records show, Chief Gallagher texted a picture of the dead captive to a fellow SEAL in California, saying, “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.” But his platoon did not see it as a good story, according to the investigation report: The SEALs called a platoon meeting and discussed how to keep the chief away from anyone he could harm. When senior platoon members confronted Chief Gallagher about the captive’s death, they said, he told them, “Stop worrying about it, they do a lot worse to us.” The SEALs told investigators they reported the killing to Lieutenant Portier that night and at other times during the deployment, but the lieutenant took no action. They said the lieutenant had trained under Chief Gallagher at BUDS and “idolized” him. Members of the platoon hoped the chief would be reprimanded when they returned home from Iraq in August 2017, according to the report. It didn’t happen. The report said they spoke repeatedly to the lieutenant’s superior, Commander Breisch, and to Chief Alazzawi and another Team 7 master chief, but were told to “decompress” and “let it go.” Commander Breisch and Chief Alazzawi disputed that account. They told investigators that they had no knowledge of the alleged war crimes until the March 2018 meeting, and that they had encouraged anyone in the platoon who had witnessed anything criminal to report it to Navy investigators. The Navy declined to make Commander Breisch or Chief Alazzawi available for interviews, citing the continuing investigation. Each member of the SEAL team had a duty to report wrongdoing as soon as possible, said Lawrence Brennan, a retired Navy captain and military lawyer who now teaches law at Fordham University. But he added, “The willingness of an institution to turn a blind eye is common.” “It’s especially true in warfare communities,” he said. “And in the SEALs, you don’t just keep it in the family, you keep it in the immediate family.” Chief Gallagher had been accused of serious misconduct before. According to the investigation report, Army Special Forces troops serving with him in Afghanistan in 2010 reported that, as a sniper, he had shot through an Afghan girl to hit the man who was carrying her, killing them both. Commander Breisch told investigators in 2018 that the 2010 report had been investigated and no wrongdoing had been found. In 2014, the report says, Mr. Gallagher was detained at a traffic stop, where he allegedly tried to run over a Navy police officer; he was released to his commander, and there is no record of punishment in the report. Soon after, he was promoted to chief. Among the text messages included in the investigation report are some between Chief Gallagher and another SEAL chief, David Swarts, who is being prosecuted for the beating of detainees in a separate case dating from 2012. Chief Gallagher told Chief Swarts about his looming investigation and said he felt he could not trust anyone any more. When Chief Swarts responded that he never thought SEALs would report one another, Chief Gallagher replied, “Me either, those days are gone.” [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive articles about duty, conflict and consequence.] Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of At War delivered to your inbox every week.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., outside her office in the Longworth House Office Building on Feb. 11. She is one of the first Muslim members of Congress and has received death threats. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Law enforcement discovered a cache of ammunition and illegal guns in the New York home of a man arrested after threatening to shoot Rep. Ilhan Omar, federal prosecutors say. Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., 55, is said to have called the office of the Minnesota congresswoman in March to threaten her life and repeat an anti-Muslim conspiracy theory. “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a [expletive] terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her [expletive] skull,” Carlineo said in the call, according to the U.S. Attorney General’s Office. Omar, along with fellow freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, is one of the first Muslim women in history to be elected to Congress. [FBI investigating assassination threat against Rep. Omar scrawled on gas station bathroom stall] During a police search of Carlineo’s Steuben County home, officers confiscated six firearms, including an AK-47 and a .45-caliber handgun, federal prosecutors said in a bail hearing Monday, local CBS affiliate WROC reported. Carlineo was charged with threatening to assault and murder a United States official, a story on the station’s website said. The guns were owned illegally, because Carlineo was previously convicted of a felony, WROC reported. Prosecutors say the alleged death threat to Omar’s office was made on the afternoon of March 21. Carlineo’s attorney argued that what was said in the call, which was not recorded, is in dispute. Carlineo maintains he said, “If our forefathers were still alive, they would put a bullet in [Omar’s] skull,” according to Rochester First. The alleged call, traced to Carlineo’s girlfriend, was made before a recent surge in death threats to Omar. Those threats followed a video tweeted by President Donald Trump that interspersed remarks she made to a Muslim civil rights organization with footage from the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/highline/article/parkland/---split---Max Eden didn’t even want to read about Parkland. He saw the news on Valentine’s Day, after a dinner date with his girlfriend at a little French place in Washington, D.C., taking an Uber home. There was the gut-punch—“oh shit, another school shooting”—then the queasy afterthought that none of this hits as hard as it used to. He knew what would follow. For a few angry weeks, Democrats would demand gun control and Republicans would call for arming teachers. He decided he’d sit it out this time, ignore the news as much as possible. And for a few days he did, until a journalist tweeted that the shooter’s school record proved a point that Eden had been making for much of his career. At 30 years old, Eden has a neat beard, a balding head that he’s resigned himself to buzzing short and a quick, sometimes nervous intelligence. A Yale graduate, he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that focuses on economic and urban policy issues. For years, the institute has produced arguments about how liberal policies intended to help minorities actually hurt them. It underwrote the early welfare reform work of contrarian sociologist Charles Murray, whose book, “The Bell Curve,” infamously argued that there are racial differences in intelligence. Its senior fellow George Kelling helped advance the theory of “broken windows” policing, which posits that crackdowns on petty quality-of-life offenses ultimately reduce major crimes. More recently, fellow Heather Mac Donald has regularly appeared on Fox News to discuss the “Ferguson effect”—her argument that the Black Lives Matter movement has caused police to become less proactive, fueling urban crime. Eden’s portfolio was lower-profile. His speciality was education, which in conservative policy circles usually meant critiquing liberal reforms for focusing on underprivileged children at the expense of their more fortunate peers. (In 2016, he wrote an article to this effect titled “#AllKidsMatter.”) Eden’s mother had been a public school teacher in Cleveland, and her complaints made the work personal. For more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. Over the previous two years, Eden had focused on school discipline. The Obama administration had embarked on a major effort to address the “school-to-prison pipeline”—the glaring racial disparity in school suspensions and expulsions, which is a major contributor to an even more glaring racial disparity in America’s prisons. Eden believed the reforms had plunged schools like his mother’s into chaos and saw the reformers themselves as members of a “social justice industrial complex.” “As more money flows to ‘woke’ conferences and training programs,” he would write, “school district leaders have increasingly learned that the fastest path to career advancement is to produce fake statistical progress for minority students while passionately decrying privilege and institutional racism.” Eden tracked the news for violent incidents—like a 2017 high school stabbing in the Bronx—at schools that had adopted the new approach. Still, compared to other education debates that riled up conservatives, such as campus sexual assault or bathroom access for transgender students, discipline reform never really caught on. There was, Eden said, no natural Republican “political constituency” for his issue. Until a few days after Parkland, when the journalist’s tweet started him thinking. The shooting had occurred at the most elite public school in one of the most affluent suburbs in Broward County, and Eden typically focused on low-income, urban, majority-minority schools. But then he noticed what kids from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were saying about Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old former MSD student charged with killing 17 students and staff and injuring 17 more. In TV interviews and on social media, the students insisted they’d repeatedly warned local authorities that Cruz was obsessed with guns. A couple of days after the massacre, the FBI acknowledged it had failed to act on two tips. It would emerge that Cruz had repeated interactions with the Broward County Sheriff’s Office as well. Eden wondered, he told me, whether the shooting was connected to Broward’s reputation as “ground zero” for a policy he characterized as “try to arrest as few students as possible.” In 2013, Broward had launched an arrest- and suspension-diversion program called PROMISE that became a national model for reformers. Many believed it had even helped inspire the Obama administration’s own efforts. And when Eden tangled with reform advocates online, asking them to show him where the new policies were working, they always pointed to Broward. In the days after the shooting, Parkland students led the country in the most forceful call for gun reform in recent memory, and plenty of conservatives were looking to place the blame on anything other than lax gun laws. The first to land on PROMISE was Jack Cashill, the conspiracy-minded author of a book about “the railroading of George Zimmerman.” Cashill had long argued that Trayvon Martin, the black teenager whom Zimmerman shot and killed in 2012, was in fact a budding criminal whose aptitude for “street fighting, drugs, guns, burglary and mixed martial arts” had been obscured because his Florida school district participated in a program to reduce student arrests. Now, Cashill theorized that Broward had similarly excused Cruz because, although he is white, his name made him “a statistical Hispanic.” The next day, a right-wing blog posted a series of tweets arguing that Cruz had benefited from “the Trayvon Martin standard.” The thread was shared almost 12,000 times, and the theory quickly spread from Infowars to Rush Limbaugh to Breitbart to Fox News, until Ann Coulter was describing PROMISE as “the school to mass murder pipeline.” But it was Eden, whose work had been cited in the Senate, who made the argument influential. ( 1 ) CNN’s Jake Tapper also aggressively questioned Broward Sheriff Scott Israel about the potential role of the district's discipline policies. That exchange was overshadowed by Israel's claim that he provided “amazing leadership," although the only armed official stationed at MSD failed to intervene in the massacre. Twelve days after the shooting, Eden wrote an article for the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal, suggesting—in more measured terms than Cashill or Coulter—that Broward’s approach to school discipline might have allowed Cruz to “slip through the cracks.” Within days, Florida state Representative Richard Corcoran announced that he planned to propose legislation revoking Broward’s “no-arrest policy,” and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling on them to revise former President Barack Obama’s reforms. In the coming months, Eden would testify before Congress and speak to DeVos. In the conservative and mainstream press, his arguments helped to advance a narrative that he’d later acknowledge happened to be “very politically convenient” for conservatives: that the Parkland shooting “wasn’t guns, it was Obama.” And then, in April, he traveled to Parkland. Eden hoped to write an article about a failed policy—he wasn’t planning to get personally involved. But there were some in Parkland who found his arguments persuasive. The father of one slain MSD senior sought Eden out and declared that his work would be central to his search for “justice for my daughter’s murder.” It was the start of an unlikely partnership that would entangle a grieving community in one of the ugliest political fights that people in Broward could remember. Twenty years ago, the Columbine school shooting was the deadliest of its kind in U.S. history. As with the shooting in Parkland, no major gun reforms followed. And yet Columbine did prompt profound change of another, less obvious kind, as schools all over the country overhauled their safety procedures. In 1997, just 10 percent of public schools had campus-based police, known as school resource officers or SROs. By 2014, it was 30 percent. Between 1996 and 2008, the number of school districts that had their own police departments more than doubled. The purpose of these new practices was to protect students from violence. But what happened instead was the widespread criminalization of bad behavior. Before Columbine, some 79 percent of schools had zero tolerance policies for violence, according to the Department of Education; a federal law mandated a year’s suspension for bringing a gun on campus. After the shooting, schools rushed to expand these policies to lesser forms of misconduct. What was seen as a “weapon” expanded to the point of absurdity. Students were suspended or expelled for bringing butter knives in their lunchboxes, aiming “finger guns” or biting a Pop-Tart into what teachers interpreted as the shape of a gun. Arrest rates skyrocketed for vaguely defined offenses like “disruption.” (These arrests often escalated from behavior as minor as throwing pencils in class or running in halls.) In public schools with SROs, students were five times more likely to be arrested for “disorderly conduct” than at schools without them. Researchers eventually deemed that the new zero tolerance rules didn’t actually increase school safety. Meanwhile, even as juvenile crime rates steadily decreased after their 1994 peak, suspensions kept rising. ( 2 ) Annual student suspensions nearly doubled from 1974 to 2001, increasing from 1.7 million to 3.1 million over that time. The new precautions coincided with a heightened suspicion of teenagers in the mid-’90s, a fear that was often racialized. And it was students of color—especially black students, and especially black boys—who bore the brunt of the post-Columbine emphasis on school security. Black students account for around 15 percent of the public school population but around a third of school-based arrests. Even as preschoolers, black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended as their white peers, and twice as likely to be arrested at school, according to The Sentencing Project. In recent years, security cameras and student cellphones have captured shocking footage of black children on campus being manhandled like dangerous criminals—a teenage girl violently flipped over and thrown across the room by an SRO; a kindergartner handcuffed for a temper tantrum. Russell Skiba, a professor emeritus at Indiana University and a leading researcher on disparate discipline, noted that over 20 years, all but a handful of studies have found that the reason for the discrepancy isn't that black children are misbehaving at higher rates. Rather, black students are punished more for offenses that rely on subjective assessment, such as “disruptive behavior” or “defiance.” White students, meanwhile, are more often punished for objective offenses that can’t be ignored, like smoking or vandalism. Black students are also 31 percent more likely to receive discretionary suspensions, according to the Justice Center—that is, not for violations that would automatically mandate it. Many researchers largely attribute the problem to implicit bias: teachers, administrators and SROs judging the same behavior differently depending on the race of the child. One superintendent in Minnesota examined discipline referrals for her district’s kindergartens and found that when white kids misbehaved, teachers described them as high-strung or frustrated—unable to “use his words”—while black classmates were labeled unmanageable or violent. These experiences can alter the course of a student’s life. According to an authoritative 2011 study in Texas, children who are suspended are twice as likely as similar peers to drop out and 11 times more likely to become involved with the juvenile justice system. Other studies have found those who drop out are three times more likely to end up incarcerated. Broward was as good an example as any of this phenomenon. In 2011, the county had the most school arrests in Florida. As the nation’s sixth-largest district, this was perhaps not surprising—but 71 percent of those arrests were for misdemeanors like graffiti or possessing marijuana. According to the local NAACP, black students in Broward were two and a half times more likely than white students to be suspended, expelled and arrested. Their achievement gap was also stark. In 2011, only 57 percent of the district’s black male students graduated; several years earlier, the graduation rate for that group had been the third-worst in the country among districts with a large black population. Robert Runcie became Broward’s first permanent black superintendent in 2011. He wasn’t a career educator. A tall, wiry, driven man with a thin mustache, he’d grown up in a cinder-block house in Jamaica and emigrated with his working-class family to the U.S. when he was 6. He studied economics at Harvard and Northwestern and founded a technology consulting firm. In 2003, his college friend Arne Duncan, then the CEO of Chicago’s public schools, asked him to run the district’s data systems. There, he helped to work on an algorithm project to determine which students were at greatest risk of being harmed by gang violence. After his arrival in Broward, Runcie was contacted by a small core of leaders, convened by the local NAACP, that had been trying to address the school-to-prison pipeline. Runcie “was a data geek,” said Gordon Weekes, an attorney in Broward’s public defender’s office. “He said, ‘Whatever the data shows, it shows.’” When the data demonstrated that there were indeed significant racial disparities at work, the group assembled a coalition, joined by Runcie and various local agencies, including law enforcement, to review the district’s policies. The team was particularly intrigued by a model developed in the poorest school district in metro Atlanta. Over a 10-year span, the arrival of police in Clayton County schools had led to a 1,200 percent increase in school-based arrests, overwhelmingly for petty offenses. Black students were 12 times more likely than white ones to be arrested. Graduation rates fell to an all-time low and crime in the county increased. As Clayton Juvenile Judge Steve Teske explained, once children are pulled into the system, they begin to identify as delinquents and are desensitized to the threat of jail. Arrest a student for low-level misbehavior, Teske has said, and “you might as well be sending him to prison one day.” In 2004, Teske brokered a partnership between school and law enforcement in which arrests would be diverted for four minor offenses—fights, disorderly conduct, disruption and failure to follow police instructions. This led to a 70 percent drop in arrests and rising graduation rates. Georgia’s then-Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican and former juvenile judge, described Teske’s work as “revolutionary.” In 2013, Broward’s team expanded “the Teske model” into a program they called PROMISE (Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Support and Education). It covered 13 common types of misbehavior, including alcohol and marijuana possession, vandalism and “minor fighting.” Instead of being arrested for those offenses, students could be sent to one of the district’s alternative schools, Pine Ridge Education Center, for classes, counseling and a wide range of social services to address the underlying causes of misbehavior. Over the next four years, Broward’s school arrests fell 63 percent. An independent assessment by Nova Southeastern University, which offers counseling services in partnership with PROMISE, found that same-year recidivism dropped from 50 percent to 8 percent. The black male graduation rate, meanwhile, increased significantly. Runcie and his Executive Director of Student Support Initiatives, Michaelle “Mickey” Pope, were inundated with calls for advice from educators around the country. Runcie would eventually be invited to a White House panel that recognized Broward as leading the nation in discipline reforms. In January 2014, all public K-12 schools received a “Dear Colleague” letter from the departments of Justice and Education (the latter then led by Arne Duncan). Under the Civil Rights Act, the letter said, federally funded entities could not penalize students of one race disproportionately. Any “disparate impact” could be evidence of discrimination, even if policies were race-neutral on their face. The letter signaled that the education department’s Office of Civil Rights would investigate potential violations. The American Civil Liberties Union described the move as “groundbreaking”; dozens of states and school districts subsequently instituted reforms. Conservative critics like Eden objected on multiple fronts. ( 3 ) Conservative think tanks that follow education policy include the American Enterprise Institute, the Federalist Society and the Hoover Institution, as well as smaller organizations like the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, the Center for Equal Opportunity and the Center for the American Experiment. When DeVos held her first “listening session” on the Obama guidance, multiple members of this network attended. They argued that the guidance was federal overreach and that it changed the standard for discrimination from equal treatment to equal outcomes. Many were deeply skeptical of the restorative justice programs that replaced suspensions for certain offenses, or bristled at the implication that educators might harbor unconscious biases. They often cited a 2014 report that attributed the disparities to previous misbehavior (though Skiba said this study has methodological flaws). Some argued that the research didn’t prove that suspensions actually cause the negative outcomes cited by reformers. And then there were those who believed that minorities simply misbehave more often, as a result of poverty or single-parent homes. Eden’s Manhattan Institute colleague, Heather Mac Donald—whose books include “The Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture”—wrote in City Journal, “Given what we know about the breakdown of family socialization in the black community, it is wholly consistent that black students would be more prone to insubordination and classroom disruption.” ( 4 ) Multiple studies show that even black students from two-parent, middle- or upper-class homes are still disciplined at school more than their white counterparts. Somewhat more gently, Eden agreed: “I see dramatic disparities, but I think they’re baked into American society due to the American sin of slavery and generations of policies, whether well- or mal-intended, holding African American students to lower standards.” But mostly, conservatives complained that the letter forced schools into a dangerous numbers game. Eden characterized it this way: If three black students and one white student were suspended for swearing at a teacher, the school could be violating the guidance by producing a disparate outcome. As a result, he said, schools are compelled to “juke the stats”—borrowing the term from “The Wire,” a show that delivered a devastating indictment of broken windows policing and traditional disciplinary approaches in poor urban schools. To support his argument, Eden collected school surveys administered by officials or teachers unions. He found more than 10 large districts where teachers said discipline reform wasn’t working. In Oklahoma City, one teacher reported that the principal had said suspensions were no longer mandatory unless there was an incident involving blood. In other districts, some teachers reported feeling so distraught—by both the policy and the implication that they were racist if they objected to it—that they’d considered leaving the profession altogether. Eden’s most recognized work is a 2017 report claiming that after New York City enacted reforms, at 38 percent of schools an increased share of teachers said order and discipline had grown worse. However, education policy writer RiShawn Biddle took issue with the methodology. Biddle noted the raw survey data showed that, district wide, the proportion of teachers who thought order and discipline had been maintained actually remained steady, at 80 percent. (Eden also found that at 44 percent of schools, more students reported fighting than before.) Beyond that, Biddle said, there are inherent limitations to using survey responses as an objective measure of safety. He pointed to a 2016 study that found white teachers have lower expectations of their black students than do black teachers, as well as a 2015 study showing that black children are suspended less often when taught by black teachers. “Teachers, students, parents all have biases,” Biddle said. “You’re dealing with perception, and for many people, perception is reality.” After President Donald Trump was elected, Eden and other reform opponents had the ear of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Four months into the new administration, Eden wrote an op-ed urging DeVos to rescind the Obama letter. In the fall of 2017, a Federalist Society report accused reformers of transforming schools into “menacing places where gangs of out-of-control teens prowl the halls.” Soon afterward, DeVos hired the study’s co-author. In September, DeVos, who’d already withdrawn one Obama guidance concerning the rights of transgender students, announced she was pulling a second, concerning campus sexual assault. Conservatives clamored for her to keep going, with one think tank cheering, “Two Down, One to Go.” On April 10, 2018, at a meeting of the Broward County School Board, a slight, skinny kid walked up to the microphone and confidently announced that he’d completed an investigation into “the conduct of the school board and superintendent prior to the shooting at Stoneman.” Kenneth “Kenny” Preston was a 19-year-old home-schooled student in khaki pants and a dark blazer with a near-pompadour of black hair. He projected the same forceful, hyperarticulate poise that had propelled the MSD student activists into the spotlight nearly two months before, although he was at the meeting to make a very different point. Preston’s investigation had begun as a report for an online journalism course and it was now more than 3,000 words long. He focused on two charges. First, that Runcie had spent only 5 percent of a $100 million bond dedicated to safety improvements. (The district said far more than 5 percent had been allocated.) Second, that PROMISE and its champions had tied the hands of SROs, obscured the number of campus crimes and allowed more than 1,000 incarcerated students to re-enroll in district schools. ( 5 ) Under state and federal law, the school district must enroll all youth of compulsory education age, even those with felony convictions. Some are formally enrolled in schools for tracking purposes even when they’re being taught in a detention facility. After release, courts require the district to place them. Most end up in non-traditional settings, including online education, though Runcie said some may go to mainstream schools if they are determined to pose no threat. Preston quoted an anonymous former SRO who had told him, “we all knew some kind of tragedy like this was going to happen in Broward.” Several board members contested the accuracy of Preston’s findings, and Runcie lamented the spread of “fake news” about the school district. But within hours, Preston’s report was featured by The Hill; the next day he appeared on the radio show of National Rifle Association spokesperson Dana Loesch. Although conservative media treated the report as the work of an intrepid wunderkind, it wasn’t entirely a solo project. After the shooting at MSD, Preston had been incensed to see Runcie on television calling for “sensible gun control” before the dead had even been buried. After coming across Max Eden’s work online, he messaged him on Facebook to ask for help refining his presentation. “Our goal was to make [Runcie] the focus,” Preston told me—referring to what was already a small band of critics of the school district. Among them was Andrew Pollack, who had become what the Miami New Times would call “the Parkland massacre’s conservative face.” On February 14, Pollack’s daughter, Meadow, an MSD senior, had been shot nine times. The final five shots came as she attempted to cover the body of a schoolmate, Cara Loughran, who died when the bullets passed through Meadow’s body into her own. On the day of the shooting, Pollack had been on a Valentine’s Day bike ride with his wife in the Everglades. When they heard of the shooting, they sped back to the city and raced from hospital to hospital, looking for Meadow. At one point, they would later discover, they’d been driving behind the ambulance that was transporting Nikolas Cruz. That unspeakable day, Pollack had been photographed in a hospital parking lot, wearing a Trump 2020 T-shirt and holding up his phone to show a picture of Meadow beaming in a black strapless dress. A week later, Pollack stood up in a televised meeting at the White House, his tan face drawn, his two sons gripping his shoulders. He was “pissed,” he said. He couldn’t get on a plane with bottled water, “but some animal can walk into a school and shoot our children.” Pollack contended that gun control was a pipe dream and the country needed to unite around school safety solutions instead. In short order, he became a Fox News regular. A 53-year-old transplant from New York, who’d run a scrap metal dealership before getting into real estate, Pollack, with his salt-and-pepper buzz cut, has retained an accent and an attitude friends affectionately described as “Long Island redneck.” His 21-year-old son, Hunter, called him “a real tough guy.” Pollack called himself a business guy or a people guy or just a “real guy”—someone who, he frequently said, “barely graduated high school” but had common sense. In his first Fox News appearance, four days after the White House meeting, Pollack still looked shellshocked. He'd always seen Meadow, whom he'd named after Meadow Soprano, as the toughest of his three children, the one who seemed most like himself. When the host asked what he thought of the calls for gun control, Pollack accused him of “polarizing this event.” “You didn’t say one thing about fixing it!” he exclaimed. For Pollack, to “fix it”—a phrase he’d make his signature hashtag—meant fortifying schools like courthouses or airports. In subsequent Fox appearances, Pollack liked to observe that his opponents were driven by an agenda—trying to politicize his daughter’s death—but he was not for any party except the party of your kids coming home after school. Though he said he’d never tied a tie in his life before the shooting, he now wore suits almost daily for interviews or meetings with state legislators, governors, members of Congress, President Trump and Secretary DeVos. His social media following swelled to more than 120,000 people. His dog Sonny became a repeat attraction on the Twitter account “Conservative Pets.” Sometimes, Pollack marveled at the man he’d become. His daughter’s murder had empowered him. “I could walk through flames right now,” he said in that first interview on Fox. He sometimes referred to himself as “Mr. Pollack,” as in, “Nobody’s even looking at this except Mr. Pollack.” He almost always called his daughter’s killer by his inmate number, 18-1958. Despite his growing profile, Pollack read every message he received, afraid of missing a vital clue in his mission to expose what had gone wrong. So when Kenny Preston reached out to families of MSD victims about his report, Pollack rallied other parents to sign a letter to the school district, demanding answers. ( 6 ) After several sources quoted by Preston repudiated the final product, the families withdrew their signatures. He would later write that he told Preston, “Listen, I don’t give a fuck if it turns out you’re wrong. So what if it blows up in my face? ... I want to know everything, and you’re doing the right thing.” Back in Washington, Eden was also impressed by Preston’s tenacity. Preston had challenged the school board even after a two-hour meeting with Runcie, three victims’ families and 10 district officials, in what Preston saw as an attempt to “reeducate” him. “He’s my fucking American hero,” Eden told me. He viewed the school district’s reaction as a sign that it had something to hide and decided to go to Parkland himself, to see what he could find out. There, Eden met with 15-year-old Anthony Borges, who’d been shot five times while holding a classroom door closed to protect other kids. His family had sued the district, charging that PROMISE was part of a lenient “atmosphere of the whole school.” Borges had only recently been released from the hospital when Eden visited him in his bedroom. He had fresh surgical incisions healing on his wiry torso and a colostomy bag sticking out the side of his stomach. Eden hadn’t planned to talk to Pollack, who was so frequently on television, “pointing every finger at everything that was popping up.” Eden figured if he knew anything about PROMISE, he’d have said so, loudly. Plus, even from a distance, Pollack seemed “really intense.” But then Pollack invited Eden to his Spanish-tiled ranch house in Coral Springs. Pollack had joined the newly established Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, which was undertaking an exhaustive inquiry into the tragedy, and he wanted advice. Eden suggested he find out about Cruz’s disciplinary record—whether Cruz had committed any crimes he wasn’t arrested for. His contention was that if Cruz had been arrested at school, a criminal record could have prevented him from buying a gun. Pollack said he was told that the commission wasn’t sure whether the district had yet shared all the relevant records. He, too, sensed a cover-up. (The commission would later confirm the district had cooperated fully in sharing information.) Pollack made Eden an offer: If Eden would help him with an “independent investigation,” Pollack would introduce him to everyone he could find, put him up in his house for free, even reimburse his flights. Between April and September of 2018, Eden came down to Broward every several weeks. The independent investigation turned into a book that he and Pollack would write together. They made an odd pair: Eden’s cool, preppy eloquence and Pollack’s brash swagger. The two men had almost nothing in common—“I can't imagine any circumstances under which we would have struck up a friendship,” Eden said—yet they reached a point where each knew what the other would say about anything they found. They are both Jewish, said Eden, and that seemed significant. Pollack leaned into this idea, telling Eden their collaboration was “like a Moses and Aaron thing.” Pollack believed he was channeling something he couldn’t express, but that was why Eden was there—to help him find the words. He had come to see PROMISE, and everything it stood for, as key to the entire tragedy. As he put it: “The reason [Cruz] murdered my daughter and 16 other people was that the system around him was even sicker than he was.” At the Broward County School Board building, a high-rise in downtown Fort Lauderdale just steps from the courthouse, district officials couldn’t believe that PROMISE was becoming a scapegoat for the shootings. Chief Academic Officer Daniel Gohl started a spreadsheet to track the spread of the claims. At first, he said, the attacks seemed like “throwing spaghetti against the wall.” But then, they started to stick, maybe because PROMISE tapped into so many cultural divisions at once: debates about child-rearing and which kids are dangerous, suspicions that the Obama administration had favored minorities, and simmering racial and political tensions within Broward itself. As the strongest Democratic county in the state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1, Broward conservatives bitterly resented what they saw as monolithic liberal power. Runcie’s tenure in Broward had been complicated by some of his efforts to combat inequality: A decision to transfer a star principal from an A-rated suburban school to an F-rated inner-city institution had rankled. Runcie himself viewed the attacks on PROMISE as part of a Trump-era push to undo anything associated with Obama—even if “what we put here in Broward County had nothing to do with the Obama administration.” He found himself starring in Parkland conspiracy theories, including one that accused him of working with Sheriff Scott Israel (and Obama, and Hillary Clinton) to let Cruz loose in order to facilitate a gun grab. The Borges’ family attorney, Eden later wrote, told him he’d learned about PROMISE from a blog that urges traditionalist Christians to migrate to a “Redoubt” of survivalist communities in Idaho and that blamed PROMISE in part on George Soros. Like a constant drumbeat below these claims was the knowing repetition that Runcie hailed from Chicago. After a while, noted Runcie, who said he spent the first few weeks after the shooting working 15-hour days, seven days a week, “I stopped looking at all the stuff from what I call ‘the crazies.’” A week after Preston’s school board speech, a community forum was convened at a local high school. Nearly two months after the shooting, it was clear there had been real and systemic failures across multiple agencies. The FBI and Broward County Sheriff’s Office hadn’t followed up on obvious warnings, including a tip about a YouTube video in which Cruz allegedly declared he was “going to be a professional school shooter.” Sheriff's officers had contact with Cruz’s family 43 times since 2008, but he’d never been arrested. ( 7 ) Only half the visits involved Nikolas; most were for relatively minor issues. Two substantial reports were overlooked: a social media threat and a family friend's warning that he “might be a Columbine in the making.” There was also the inaction of the SRO posted at Stoneman Douglas on the day of the shooting and the fact that multiple staff hadn’t confronted Cruz or called a “Code Red” lockdown. But when it came time for parents, students and teachers to voice their anger, PROMISE was a recurring target. A teacher from South Plantation who’d lost a loved one at MSD said the program had “created a safe haven for criminals in our schools.” A father of three Parkland students waved a copy of a disciplinary document, claiming that it allowed “students convicted of rape and murder to sit next to our kids.” Runcie and other district employees tried to explain that the program was used for only 2 to 3 percent of all student behavioral offenses and that 90 percent of its graduates weren’t repeat offenders. ( 8 ) One of Eden and Pollack's most effective attacks was that the district only counted repeat offenses if they occurred in the same school year. A district analysis found that in 2017 to 2018, of nearly 2,000 PROMISE attendees, only 46 had more than two offenses. Tim Sternberg, a former assistant principal at the school where PROMISE is based, also claimed the district classified recidivism as a second violation of the same offense, theoretically meaning a student could commit all 13 PROMISE-eligible offenses in a year without being considered a repeat offender. Although this claim appeared in news reports, Runcie and Pope said it had never been true. A black teenager, dressed sharply in a dress shirt, suspenders and bow tie, came to the mic to say he’d attended PROMISE after a drug offense, and it had opened his eyes—that “every day someone was talking about life choices.” But none of that seemed to matter, as dozens of speakers lined up for more than an hour. A mother suggested that when the district hired security contractors, it favored “minority and diversity outreach” vendors over those with safety expertise. Members of the audience shouted: “Where is the money?” One father told Runcie he’d watched him during the Pledge of Allegiance and hadn’t seen his lips move. Runcie clenched his jaw and said nothing. Kenny Preston took the mic again, more combative than the week before. “I don’t want a runaround,” he admonished Runcie. When Preston called for the district to vote out the existing board and elect new leadership, the applause in the room was deafening. The city of Parkland is a pristine, almost antiseptic landscape of more than two dozen interlocking gated communities. For years, strict zoning laws prohibited the construction of any stores within its limits. In 2017, it was named the safest city in Florida. Marjory Stoneman Douglas, nestled amid the pink stucco, palm trees and man-made lakes, had long been considered the district’s most desirable school. Many months after the shooting, messages of support were still draped on the buildings surrounding MSD. Gauzy purple bows hung from the trees lining the school driveway; #MSDStrong T-shirts were everywhere. Bereaved parents who’d been counseled to stay busy created foundations in their children’s names, made rubber bracelets with different colors for the victims, became lay experts on ballistics or metal detectors. Whenever Eden visited, he stayed in a house that felt haunted. Earlier that spring, the far fence of the Pollacks’ backyard tennis court had been interwoven with pink tape spelling Meadow’s name, for a memorial playground fundraiser. The tape remained there for months, a physical reminder of her absence, alongside subtler reminders, like the part of the fence that was damaged when a tree fell on it but never got repaired. Every morning, Eden and Pollack walked to Pollack’s favorite cafe in a nearby retail strip for breakfast. Eden spent his days interviewing MSD teachers, administrators, students and parents. He found he could only stay in Parkland for a few nights at a time. Talking with traumatized people and learning more about Cruz left him feeling exhausted and dirty. He watched one source, a teacher who’d been at the school that day, sink into depression. He couldn’t sleep at all in Broward, nor well in Washington—only in his childhood bed at his parents’ home in Cleveland. So that summer he flew in a triangle, from Broward to Cleveland to Washington, then back for another round. Pollack, meanwhile, could never turn off. “With Andy, it’s the same at 7:30 a.m. as it is at 11 p.m. as it is at 3 p.m.,” Eden said. “I don’t think he can do anything else.” “This is my life now,” Pollack would tell reporters—so many reporters he couldn’t remember whom he’d spoken to. That summer, Pollack threw himself into the campaign to oust Runcie. At a backyard barbecue with other MSD families, Preston, Pollack and others brainstormed candidates. They hoped to elect three to four new school board members to form a five-seat majority that could unseat Runcie and shut down PROMISE. Preston and Pollack met with Lori Alhadeff and Ryan Petty, two parents of Parkland victims. ( 9 ) Fourteen-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff, the captain of her soccer team, and Alaina Petty, a Junior ROTC cadet, were killed in the same English class. Pollack also approached Richard Mendelson, a former MSD social studies teacher and wrestling coach who teaches in the psychology graduate program at Fort Lauderdale’s Keiser University. Mendelson had been a close friend of Aaron Feis, one of three MSD coaches killed by Cruz. Soon after the shooting, he wrote Pollack to offer his support, and after the idea of running was proposed, he quickly agreed. His opponent would be Laurie Rich Levinson, who had signed the original PROMISE agreement as a representative of the school board. The battle lines couldn’t have been clearer. The anti-Runcie forces got an early boost in May, when a local NPR station reported that Cruz had been referred to PROMISE, despite Runcie’s repeated assurances otherwise. Runcie’s staff returned to their records—distributed across 17 different data systems, plus paper archives—and eventually found that during the first month of PROMISE’s existence, in November 2013, an eighth-grade Cruz had been referred for breaking a bathroom faucet. They couldn’t confirm whether he’d actually attended. Later, even some of the most vehement critics, including Eden, would admit that it was probably some kind of records mishap. ( 10 ) At most, Cruz’s absence was potentially missed by different data systems that weren’t synced in 2013. At the least, the district said, his referral may have been one of many automatically generated options, lingering in the system as a sort of digital ghost. But to Pollack, it was hard proof that Runcie, “a guy with a Harvard education,” had intentionally misled the people of Parkland. A week later, Petty and Alhadeff jointly announced that they were challenging two school board members as an explicit rebuke to the district. I met Alhadeff, a teacher turned stay-at-home mother, in the empty banquet room of her gated community’s clubhouse. She recalled how at the shiva for her daughter, “hundreds” of people told her, “we want change, we want change”—but then were unwilling to do anything. “It just became very clear to me that I needed to be able to step up,” she said. Both Alhadeff and Petty called for school security improvements, like bulletproof doors, and vowed to review PROMISE. Petty tweeted that such programs created “perverse incentives” for schools, while Alhadeff told reporters that the district had swung from “over-disciplining kids to not disciplining kids at all.” Eden said Pollack had sometimes struggled to grasp his systemic arguments about school discipline reform—how the specifics of Cruz’s story connected to Eden’s broader thesis. But Pollack’s quest for “accountability” became all-consuming. In June, Pollack learned that the school guard who’d failed to confront Cruz ( 11 ) By then, Cruz had been banned from campus; the guard, Andrew Medina, knew him as “crazy boy.” had almost been fired the year before, over allegations that he’d sexually harassed several students. One was Meadow. The guard, who denied the accusations, had received a three-day suspension. Pollack was enraged to discover that he was still working at MSD. ( 12 ) Pollack said he and two other fathers complained to MSD. Medina was not rehired for the 2018-2019 school year. That, Eden recalled, was when the culture of Broward schools became a “cosmic problem” for his friend. Pollack stepped down from the MSD safety commission and took on the management of Mendelson’s campaign. Mendelson seems to relish the incongruity of his large, boisterous bearing and his fondness for intellectual debate—a bookish jock. We met at a Starbucks, along with Ray Feis, the younger brother of his late friend, Aaron. Ray has the same bald head and glasses as his brother, the same ruddy coloring and red beard. He’d lived next door to Aaron but had sold his house after the shooting. “It just didn't feel right, seeing other people move in and him not being there, you know,” he told me. During our conversation, Mendelson turned to a coffee-stained copy of a Broward policy document to argue that “even capital offenses”—like rape and murder—“are considered school-based discipline issues now.” ( 13 ) Broward schools don't handle major crimes. Mendelson seemed to be referencing a district policy outlining how schools should meet their legal obligation to educate all children, including those with criminal records. The issue of school discipline was finally attracting national attention among conservatives. In mid-July, Pollack and Preston traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak at the high school leadership summit of Turning Point USA. The pro-Trump group had recently named an MSD student as its high school outreach coordinator. ( 14 ) Kyle Kashuv thrilled NRA fans by tweeting videos of himself shooting an AR-15. When his schoolmates rallied at the March for Our Lives, Kashuv told "Face the Nation" that Parkland students like him were being ignored. He and Preston wrote an op-ed calling for Runcie’s resignation. At the TPUSA event—which offered scholarships to cover expenses for MSD students—Senator Marco Rubio introduced Pollack in a video. Pollack called on the audience to volunteer for Mendelson’s campaign, calling it “the single most important political race in 2018.” Pollack had also gained an unlikely ally in Tim Sternberg, a former assistant principal at Pine Ridge, where the PROMISE program is housed. Sternberg believed, he said, in dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. But he’d come to view PROMISE as disorganized and ineffective. (In addition, he claimed to Eden, he’d been passed over for two promotions that went to black candidates.) When Sternberg resigned in 2017, he sent a flurry of emails to Runcie and others about what he saw as the program’s shortcomings but was unsatisfied with the responses. Even though Sternberg believed the program was ultimately salvageable, he began sharing information with Eden and Pollack. “I started almost joining a bandwagon of ‘PROMISE, PROMISE, PROMISE,’” he said. The MSD safety commission tried to calm the furor. In mid-July 2018, its chair, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, emphatically declared to reporters that PROMISE was “completely irrelevant, it's a rabbit hole, it's a red herring, it's immaterial.” But there was too much anger swirling around the school district and its officials, some of it stemming from unrelated grievances. The district had sometimes appeared less than forthcoming with the press or public. Promised security updates had been delayed, and family members of the victims accused the district of doing a poor job of attending to survivors’ needs. One victim’s mother, who was also a Broward elementary principal, initially wasn’t paid when she took bereavement leave. That summer, a Sun Sentinel investigation found that MSD—like many other Florida schools—had underreported campus crime, in order to attract or retain students. And, in August, the Sun Sentinel discovered that an outside consultant had found serious failures in how the district—as well as other local agencies—had handled Nikolas Cruz. According to Cruz’s mother, he had suffered from autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under federal disability law, Cruz was supposed to have access to the most mainstream educational environment possible. After being sent to Cross Creek, a school for students with intensive behavioral issues, in middle school, he’d done well enough to be transitioned to MSD by 10th grade. However, when he was 18, district staff had incorrectly allowed him to forfeit his disability status in order to stay at MSD, even though he’d displayed disturbing signs of needing help, including bringing dead animals and bullets to school, cutting himself and discussing suicide attempts. In the eyes of the district, he was now a general education student and ultimately had to withdraw after failing classes. Days later, he bought the AR-15 he’d use to kill his classmates. When his mother later tried to re-enroll him in Cross Creek, the district failed to follow through. Even MSD families who didn’t share Pollack’s politics, or his focus on PROMISE, began to join the calls for Runcie’s ouster. One of the most high-profile was Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was Cruz’s second-to-last victim. Guttenberg had become a full-time advocate for gun control after Jaime’s death. He tweeted that Runcie had “lost the faith” of those he was supposed to lead and that the school board needed a “wholesale makeover.” An already ugly race turned uglier. “Oust Runcie” bumper stickers, in MSD colors, proliferated around Parkland, although some critics referred to the superintendant as “Duncie.” On Twitter, Mendelson wrote that the election was “good versus evil” and would decide whether children “will return home safely each afternoon.” He hinted to me that Broward’s problems were partly caused by its mistaken focus on diversity. “If you were to look at the demographics of people who have been advanced into leadership roles in the past decade, as opposed to the general populace, you would see a vast difference, because they misinterpret what diversity means here,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m comfortable going further than that because I wouldn’t want the implications of that to be put in print with my name next to it.” When early voting started in mid-August, Mendelson’s and Levinson’s volunteers set up camp across from each other at polling stations. Pollack was a daily fixture at one, often showing up with his dog. Ray Feis manned the table at another location daily with his younger sister. He’d been undone by Aaron’s death, friends said, and had quit his job as a manager at a pool repair company to focus on the campaign. Almost every day, the police were called to polling stations following accusations of harassment from both camps. Levinson said that Mendelson volunteers called her a murderer with blood on her hands. Ray Feis in turn claimed that when he introduced himself to Levinson’s husband, “he started cursing me out.” (Mendelson said, “I cannot speak to every polling site, but where I was located, this simply did not happen.” Levinson said on behalf of her husband, “He did not use any curse words. He wouldn’t shake his hand because of what they were saying about his wife all day.”) One day, two deputies questioned Mendelson, responding to complaints that supporters had been heard screaming at voters, “You don’t care about my brother.” In Fort Lauderdale, the officials who’d created PROMISE repeated a sentiment so often it seemed like a mantra: that this was grief, and grief was a process, and that they had to respect that process no matter what form it took. Sometimes, though, respecting the process made it hard to defend themselves. At public forums where he or PROMISE were frequently attacked, Runcie’s face was a mask of calm: listening and nodding; responding in measured tones; biting his tongue when attacked; making himself available to talk even as critics claimed in viral videos that he was ignoring them. One-on-one, he was considerably more exasperated. “Hell yeah,” there were kindergartners in the PROMISE program who could have otherwise gotten arrest records for having tantrums, he told me. This “law enforcement criminalization mentality,” he said, “man, we know that doesn’t work.” Runcie argued that the real problem wasn’t excessive leniency, but that Broward’s disciplinary standards were still unevenly applied. Broward’s wealth distribution is often described as following a roughly east-west axis, dividing Fort Lauderdale and other eastern communities that struggle with urban poverty from wealthy western suburbs like Parkland. Multiple educators told me they suspected that, contrary to public perception, it was the wealthy western schools that were most likely to underreport infractions. “You’ve got a lot of people in the communities that make the most noise about our discipline,” said Runcie. And yet, “they’re the very first ones to come in and say, you know, John or Sally is a great straight-A student; they’re going to be graduating this year and we don’t need some discipline record that will taint their chances.” Those are the schools, he continued, where parents mediate off-the-record resolutions to fights or bring in lawyers to contest a three-day suspension. “Think about that,” he continued. “What kid in a middle-class or poor community [can] get an attorney to show up with their parent at school and say, ‘I need this taken care of’?” Weekes, the public defender who helped develop PROMISE, argued that administrators need the discretion to say, “‘I know this kid and this kid’s mom just lost her house or got a divorce—they acted up for two days after that.’” But, he went on, “We want that to happen across the board, with all children. And it wasn’t happening so much with children of color.” There are no hard numbers measuring how many students get these kinds of informal second chances. ( 15 ) Runcie said the district has introduced an audit process that includes scanning employee emails for unreported incidents. But in a state where every school gets graded, and real estate prices reflect those grades, said Daniel Gohl, the district’s chief academic officer, “I see how we set up a system that pits schools against each other and doesn’t treat data neutrally.” Tim Sternberg sometimes worried about what would happen if his new friends in the anti-PROMISE brigade got what they wanted. “Then what?” he asked. “Then we’re back to kids being arrested at 10, 11 years old? The kids in the west will continue getting away with what they get away with, because that’s what they’ve always done, and the administrators in the east will do what they do, so those kids all get arrested?” Runcie looked increasingly exhausted. His own children had received death threats at their schools or jobs. Over the years, he had taught himself to cope with trauma: As a child, his mother had been shot in the face in a hate crime while he sat beside her on their front porch. In Chicago, 300 to 400 students in his district were shot every year. “You need to find ways to create positive things out of tragedy,” he said, “or you go around creating more tragedy.” The idea of responding to the Parkland shooting by throwing the book at students for offenses that didn’t endanger school safety struck him as morally wrong. “If that’s what we’ve gotta do,” he said, “then I’m just not gonna do this work.” On August 28, election night, the Mendelson camp gathered at a Coral Springs restaurant to wait for the returns, feeling sure of victory. They’d raised over $40,000, knocked on 50,000 doors. “How could you not vote this man in?” one supporter asked. “He was going to be the savior of this community.” But when the results came in, Levinson had won with 56 percent of the vote. (Lori Alhadeff won her race, while Ryan Petty did not.) MSD students who’d volunteered on Mendelson’s campaign were weeping, as were some of the adults. “I don’t know the last time that I cried before these candidates lost the school board race,” said Eden, who described the campaign as a joint effort, despite his intentions to maintain “journalistic detachment.” Pollack found himself filled with disgust. In a county that had become synonymous with contested elections, he doubted the veracity of the results. But then, he reasoned, it was par for the course in the “politically correct cesspool” that was Democratic Broward. He put his house up for sale. “I gave it my all,” he told me, “and now it’s just like, let Rome burn, let Broward burn.” Pine Ridge Education Center, where the PROMISE program is housed, is a bustling, friendly place. When I visited last October, kids and their parents waited for appointments in the front office, which was decorated with gigantic, candy-colored blowups from the Dr. Seuss book “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Most of the high school students were there for fighting or marijuana possession. In one class I attended, they worked in clusters to answer questions about substance addiction. In a room across the hall, middle school children plugged missing words into sentences on the blackboard about self-esteem and bullying. The week before, Mickey Pope, the Broward school official, had taken a local mayor on a tour of the school. She said the mayor had been taken aback to discover elementary school students there—like many others, she'd thought PROMISE was for chronic delinquents, or at least much older kids. When they encountered a 5-year-old attendee, the mayor knelt beside him. “Baby, why are you here?” she asked. “I was bad,” the boy told her. He’d gotten mad and started crying, then kicked his teacher when she tried to take him to the office. (Before PROMISE, Pope said, he could have been arrested for battery of a school board employee.) The attacks on PROMISE had left its staff demoralized and depressed. Dr. Henry Brown, Pine Ridge’s principal, had come back to work early after having open heart surgery to throw a small party for his staff, in an attempt to cheer them up. He reminded them to stay focused on the students, but it was difficult. There was already a perception that theirs was a bad school, full of bad kids, and now that perception had hardened along racial lines. Black parents, he said, continued to see PROMISE “as an opportunity to help their child from becoming another statistic,” while vehement opponents had little understanding of the program or the students it served. PROMISE students, he said, included kids in foster care, kids facing the possible deportation of a parent, kids shouldering outsize responsibilities while their parents worked multiple jobs. One fourth grader had recently wanted to set up a lemonade stand so her mother could find someplace to live. Laura Kolo, a coordinator who’d been with PROMISE since its second year, insisted that contrary to the criticisms, the program did have a curriculum and a structure, one that had been vastly transformed since its inception. Students rarely returned more than once, and the majority of those that did were in elementary or middle school—not the dangerous teens depicted in public debate. When “high alert cases” came in—students who required more intensive intervention than PROMISE could provide—the public didn’t see the effort that went into connecting them with social services, therapy and legal help. “We would say, ‘Come visit! Look what we’re doing, the lives that we’re changing,’” said Kolo. “Sometimes the kids are good, sometimes they’re not so good. That’s what we’re dealing with.” But, she said, the critics never came. The battle over PROMISE had rattled its creators, too. A month after the school board election, the district’s Schoolhouse to Jailhouse Pipeline Committee held its quarterly meeting. Before the shooting, its members used to talk about how to make the program better, poring over data about patterns for various offenses. These days, their work was inevitably derailed by conversations about preventing another shooting—a crucial subject, but not the committee’s responsibility. From a corner of the table, Gordon Weekes interjected wearily: “We’re here to talk about minor school-based misbehavior.” It was important, he felt, not to let the kids who needed PROMISE get lost in the aftermath of the tragedy. For Weekes, the situation was particularly fraught. He had helped develop PROMISE, but, as a member of the public defender’s office, he was also part of Cruz’s legal team. On the day of the shooting, he’d been one of two staffers sent to address the media and had broken down on national television while noting the number of the victims. In his role as Cruz’s co-counsel, Weekes had criticized the district for “all the missed opportunities in this matter.” When I spoke to him in September, he couldn’t discuss whether he believed Broward had a culture of leniency, he said, because that might be “a pivotal issue in our case.” In other words, as part of Weekes’ legal duty to explore every avenue of defense in a death penalty case, he might have to attack the operation of a program he believed in, deeply, for everything it had done for Broward’s students of color. Another committee member, Judge Elijah Williams, observed that it was Columbine that had prompted a larger police presence in schools in the first place. “That’s how we got into this mess,” he said. It had taken 10 years, as thousands of kids were needlessly funnelled into the criminal justice system, for schools to address the harm that was being done. Now, Williams lamented, the post-Parkland clamor for more school guards threatened to land them right back where they’d started. As the first anniversary of the Parkland shooting drew near, the community planned moments of silence and days of service to honor their dead. At the time, Eden wondered whether Pollack, who’d poured his grief almost entirely into his battles, was having trouble accepting that “there’s only so much that can be fought, and we’ve just about reached the end of it.” Pollack sold his house and went on the road in his camper. In 2018, he’d promoted an initiative, named for Aaron Feis, to install more armed guards in public schools; one county training included a virtual reality simulation in which potential guards practiced shooting a gunman on campus. Now, Pollack met with police chiefs across Florida to warn them against programs like PROMISE. In an interview on NRATV, he declared he would “take [Runcie] out if it’s the last thing I do on earth.” “Him or the PROMISE program,” he told me. “One of them is going to go.” In early February, the Sun Sentinel reported that the former MSD security guard who failed to confront Cruz had requested a protective order against Pollack. He said that Pollack came to a youth baseball practice he was coaching, shouting that he wasn’t through with him yet. (“It's not accurate. I showed up at the game because I couldn’t believe that those parents would let their kids be coached by a guy like that,” Pollack said. “I wasn’t heckling him. I just told him that I have my lawsuit and that I’m not through with it and him yet.”) In late 2018, Eden and Pollack finished their book, “Why Meadow Died.” Due out later this year, the book delivers Eden’s policy arguments in Pollack’s everyman voice. They hadn’t tried to interview Runcie or visit Pine Ridge. But the book’s seventh chapter opens with a surprising line: “The fact that the PROMISE program is a farce is interesting and noteworthy, but it bears little direct relevance to the tragedy.” In late December, the MSD safety commission had come to the same conclusion. Buried beneath its unexpected recommendation to allow arming teachers, the commission’s report found that even if Cruz had been referred for arrest in 2013 over the broken bathroom faucet, Florida law would have mandated his immediate release to his mother. In addition, any record Cruz might have received for such a minor offense wouldn’t have prevented him from buying a gun. “I’ve been battling this for eight, nine months,” said Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, MSD safety commission chair, at one school board meeting. “People say, well, if he’d been arrested that would have prevented him from being able to purchase the firearms. That is 100 percent false and not true whatsoever.” After finishing the book, Eden began emphasizing to me a point he hadn’t made before: that in his initial City Journal op-ed, he had never actually mentioned the word “PROMISE.” He told me he had only intended to suggest that its potential role was a question someone should answer. Now, he was worried that his book would be dismissed as the NRA counternarrative, and that, if DeVos withdrew the Obama discipline guidance, newspaper headlines would read: “Unconnected effort to reduce discrimination is a casualty of the Parkland shooting.” He began saying that the criticisms of PROMISE had been caricatured and that to claim the program was the sole cause of the massacre “would be a dumb argument indeed.” In truth, Eden had come to view the Parkland shooting as more complex than he’d originally understood. Now, he said, he saw it as a story of intersecting institutional failures, less about excessive leniency alone and more about how schools handle students with extreme behavioral disabilities. The policy pressures to place Cruz in the most mainstream classroom setting possible, he contended, combined with the expense of special education, had prevented Cruz from being placed in the alternative school setting he needed. (Runcie said cost is "not part of the conversations" when specialists determine the best educational placement for students.) It was an argument that raises important questions, but also one less amenable to electric reaction. Balancing the right of students with disabilities to reach their full potential against the rights of other students to learn without disruption is a challenge everywhere, and even more so at schools like MSD. One of Pollack’s and Mendelson’s most outspoken volunteers proudly told me how she’d forced a principal to put her special-needs son in regular classes so that he wouldn’t pick up bad habits from the kids in special ed. As Eden acknowledged, it’s an issue that “doesn’t cut super neatly either way.” But by the time Eden had reached this conclusion, his hoped-for goal had been achieved. In December, DeVos and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker officially withdrew the Obama guidance. As a result, some school districts may repeal their reforms and the Department of Education will likely be less aggressive in investigating alleged discrimination. And on February 13, a day before the anniversary of the shooting, Florida’s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, whom Pollack had campaigned for, called for a grand jury investigation into whether the school district bore any responsibility for the shooting. In addition, he ordered a statewide audit of all diversion programs, specifically naming PROMISE. ( 16 ) In February, the Broward County Chiefs of Police Association notified Runcie it no longer supported PROMISE “based on the manner in which the program is being implemented.” That month, the school board approved changes, including a cap on referrals; better information-sharing with law enforcement; and an automatic threat assessment, involving police, of students who commit more than one misdemeanor. That month, the movement to fire Runcie also came to its heated conclusion. On February 25, the district held its third town hall meeting on school safety. Kenny Preston was there, and so was Tim Sternberg, who’d recently announced his own candidacy for the board, championing Pollack’s #fixit slogan. It might have been a replay of all the other meetings—but this time, Runcie had defenders: more than 1,000 people attended, many from other parts of Broward, many of them black. Some came on church buses. Some may have been alerted by an email sent by a district employee, who described the rhetoric coming from Parkland as “like nothing that has been seen since desegregation orders were enforced”—a characterization that angered many critics. Runcie’s supporters expressed condolences to the grieving families but said their side of town hadn’t been represented in the debates over the last year. The vice mayor of West Park condemned “people who are pimping the pain of the victims” for political or personal vendettas. A state senator who represents parts of eastern Broward declared, “Just as strongly as you feel about getting rid of Bob Runcie, we feel just as strong that it ain’t going to happen.” Fred Guttenberg spoke, wearing a shirt bearing Jaime's name and evidently distressed. “The bullet that shot my daughter did not know what color she was,” he said, jabbing his finger in the air. “And I’m frustrated as hell at what’s happening in this room tonight to make this about color and socioeconomic status.” But for many of the black attendees at the town hall, the attacks on PROMISE had always been about color. After the meeting, online Runcie critics wrote that “the ‘bused’ people” had “taken over” the meeting and left no room for “legitimately concerned parents.” Pollack tweeted that Runcie was “trying to spark racial conflict” in “a demented effort to save his job.” After a school board meeting the next day, Lori Alhadeff called for a vote on whether to fire Runcie for “willful neglect of duty.” The vote took place on March 5. Hundreds of people spilled into the halls and two overflow rooms. Over more than four hours, five people spoke in favor of Runcie’s termination, including one victim’s father. Eighty spoke in his defense, including local politicians, educators, clergy and two black mothers of MSD survivors. Many emphasized that Parkland was not the only community that had lost, or stood to lose, its children. “We grieved for you in a way that you’ll never understand,” said one man with a soft Caribbean accent. “It ripped our hearts open.” Others spoke of the need to move on. Runcie’s wife, Diana, spoke last. She recalled her husband coming home the night of the shooting, crying, and telling her, “I can’t believe I lost my babies.” Alhadeff’s motion lost, 6-3. Runcie would stay. He told me that he hoped the district could harness all that passion from the meetings to find a way forward. To him, the fight over PROMISE had raised “a big philosophical question [about] what we mature into as a society, how we raise our kids, how we develop human beings. Do we recognize that all our fates are connected together? That what happens to you ultimately is somehow going to impact me?” But a year after the shooting, not all shared such an optimistic view. Parents who’d become close in the immediate aftermath of the shooting had become estranged over political differences; the county seemed more polarized than ever before. At that final town hall, Fred Guttenberg took stock of the situation with a muted, weary anger: “My daughter is dead, and this community is coming apart.”
---split---4.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/like-guns-social-media-is-weapon-should-be-regulated/---split---Includes: The decision by the Sri Lankan government this week to shut down the big social networks—including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Snapchat—in the aftermath of an Easter day terrorist attack on three Catholic churches and three upscale hotels feels like a turning point in our relationship with these platforms. A Gordian knot moment, if you will, where instead of agonizing over how to untangle the social media mess you just pull out a sword and cut. The coordinated attacks, which took place in three Sri Lankan cities and killed more than 300 people, were designed to foment religious strife in a country that has been slowly recovering from a quarter-century-long civil war. On the 10-year path to peace and stability, there have been occasional flareups of religious violence, such as the anti-Muslim riots in March 2018 that left two people dead. In that case, too, the Sri Lankan government temporarily blocked the social networks to contain the violence’s spread. One member of parliament wrote on Twitter at the time, “Hate speech on @facebook is increasing beyond acceptable levels #SriLanka. Government will have to act immediately to save lives.” He later amended his comment: “I didn’t mean that way. My bad. NO hate speech is acceptable. I meant discussions were beyond acceptable levels at this tense situation.” We get his point, however, even if it appeared insensitive: Facebook clearly doesn’t care enough about the lies and hatred on its site, and usually that is appalling but survivable. At certain times, however, this negligence is more than appalling, it is life-threatening. Noam Cohen is a journalist and author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball, which uses the history of computer science and Stanford University to understand the libertarian ideas promoted by tech leaders. While working for The New York Times, Cohen wrote some of the earliest articles about Wikipedia, bitcoin, Wikileaks, and Twitter. He lives with his family in Brooklyn. The Easter attacks were of a different scale, and the swift decision by the government to act against the social networks placed them in a different category—that is, the authorities were essentially saying that the social networks are no longer considered tools that can be abused by bad actors to exacerbate tensions but weapons that must be removed from terrorists immediately. That same member of parliament felt no need to explain the blackout on Twitter this time. An aide to Sri Lanka’s president was quoted in The New York Times saying “this was a unilateral decision.” Before our eyes, the world is reassessing the proper role for the dominant social networks. Ivan Sigal, the executive director of Global Voices, an organization committed to using the internet to foster understanding across borders, took to Twitter to observe in light of the Sri Lanka attacks that, “A few years ago we’d be using these platforms to help each other and coordinating assistance. Now we view them as a threat.” He continued, “A few years ago we’d view the blocking of social media sites after an attack as outrageous censorship; now we think of it as essential duty of care, to protect ourselves from threat. #facebook your house is not in order.” In a more innocent era, social networks were considered incredible communications tools—part phone, part community room, part holiday letter—nothing but a boon for our increasingly disconnected lives. In times of crisis, as Sigal writes, they would bind us even closer together. Soon enough, we began to worry if this was the complete picture. We saw social networks as addictive and not necessarily so good for our own health and the health of children—that is, something we clearly enjoyed using but maybe should figure out a way to reduce our dependence on, either through will power or government regulation. A vice like casino gambling or tobacco. Now we are recognizing that there is an inherent potential for extremism lurking within global social networks that makes them a danger. There simply may be no safe way to deploy social networks during times of crisis or when bad actors include them in their anti-democratic playbooks. By automatically amplifying any and all messages that appear on their platforms and using highly personal data and algorithms to target those messages to where they will have the greatest potency, social networks are weapons. They must be viewed not as an extension of the people who use them but as a danger to the greater society. We need social network control—sensible rules about where, when, and what kinds of platforms should be free to operate, much the way nearly all governments in the world impose comprehensive regulations about where, when, and what kinds of guns should be allowed in communities. To fail to rein in social networks because of appeals to “freedom” would be like allowing vague words written 250 years ago to get in the way of controlling guns. I’ve come slowly and in fits and starts to this view. Until recently, I’ve preferred to focus on the bad actors who misuse social networks—not only the hate peddlers but the Silicon Valley CEOs who profit from the networks’ misuse. These amoral leaders seemed the appropriate target of scorn. But by focusing on those individuals’ shortcomings, wasn’t I buying into the argument that there was a good way for these social networks to operate, even during a time of crisis or during divisive elections? If only they had the right leaders! In essence, I was replicating the tired defense of unrestrained gun ownership—social networks don’t kill people, people kill people. In point of fact, guns magnify the violence of their users, as do social networks. Reading the defenses mounted on behalf of social networks in response to Sri Lanka’s decision to impose the blackout (including on WIRED) again reminded me of the gun control debate. Some defenders noted that Sri Lanka has a relatively unfree press and that social networks were an important alternate source of news and reporting. Alp Toker, executive director NetBlocks, a London-based organization that tracks internet bans around the world, spoke to the Associated Press about the vacuum of information that is left in the wake of the Sri Lanka social network shutdown and is “readily exploited by other parties. It can add to the sense of fear and can cause panic.” This, again, speaks to the potency of social networks—their defenders are promising that social networks can replace a corrupt system with a user-based one. I understand the attraction of such a claim, even if it is a form of the gun extremist’s contention that the best answer to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. That is, a defense based on seeing the status quo as irredeemably flawed, and favoring a type of every-person-for-themself anarchy in its place. There were other arguments that quickly emerged online in defense of social networks. Some referred to a study that asserted that closing down social networks led to more violence. These assertions can be hard to assess. Opponents of gun laws will argue that the areas with the strictest gun laws—often large cities—have the most gun violence. So how effective is gun control then? Finally, there was the popular defense that says, Don’t judge us by the worst users but by our best users. That is, guns give people a sense of security; they are used for hunting; shooting is a popular sport. A Facebook spokesperson emphasized how the platform served vital functions in a time of crisis. “People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time,” the spokesperson said. The statement begins, “Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act.” A worthwhile sentiment, though it must be said that when such sentiments are expressed by gun control opponents after a mass shooting, they are frequently mocked as merely “thoughts and prayers.” What we really need are thoughtful laws. Steve Stephens recorded himself murdering an innocent victim and then uploaded the footage to Facebook. The horrific act has put Facebook under immense pressure to do something, but can the company prevent broadcasting acts of violence without fundamentally changing the purpose of the social media platform.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/opinion/when-license-plate-surveillance-goes-horribly-wrong.html---split---Advertisement Supported by The pitfalls of automated policing, where one piece of bad information can lead to a guns-drawn confrontation. By Charlie Warzel Mr. Warzel is an Opinion writer at large. This article is part of a limited-run newsletter. You can sign up here. Brian Hofer and his brother were on their way home from a Thanksgiving visit, headed toward Oakland, Calif., on Interstate 80 when he saw the flashing lights. Police officers directed him off the highway and into a shopping center. That’s around the time the guns came out. According to Mr. Hofer, he was escorted out of his car and cuffed. From the back of a squad car, he recalls watching officers, guns drawn, push his handcuffed brother to his knees. Hofer says the officers pointed a gun at the back of his brother’s head. “I was terrified,” Mr. Hofer told me. “I’m sitting ice-cold and saying nothing because I do not want any itchy trigger fingers.” After a few minutes, officers told Mr. Hofer the car he’d been driving — a rental using the app Getaround — had been reported stolen earlier that year. From the back of the squad car, Hofer attempted to explain the situation, allowing police to use the Getaround app to find his paperwork and contact the company. After roughly 40 minutes, police verified Hofer’s identity and he and his brother were released. So what happened? According to police, Mr. Hofer’s car was flagged by a fixed stationary camera near the tiny city of Hercules, Calif. The stationary camera, operated by a company called Vigilant Solutions, scanned the license plate of Mr. Hofer’s car, which matched the number to a “hot list” registry of stolen vehicles. Within minutes Vigilant’s cameras pinged law enforcement — quickly enough that they were able to pull Mr. Hofer over just miles up the road. Mr. Hofer’s harrowing journey highlights the pitfalls of automated policing, where one piece of bad information can lead to a guns-drawn confrontation. In one respect, the system worked as intended: Mr. Hofer’s car had indeed previously been stolen. But because the “hot list” database of stolen vehicles hadn’t been properly updated to show the car was no longer stolen, the license-plate scan triggered law enforcement. Detainments like Mr. Hofer’s are a growing reality for millions of Americans, whose movements are being constantly tracked by an array of surveillance cameras, some of which actively contact law enforcement. In California, the cameras have resulted in a number of notable traffic stops of criminals, in some cases leading police to murder and arson suspects. But according to an estimate from the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, the machines have a troubling 10 percent error rate. Mr. Hofer happens to be the chairman of Oakland’s Privacy Advisory Commission. In addition to filing a federal lawsuit against the Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Department for the detainment, he’s speaking out against the surveillance technology. “The error rate of this technology is incredibly alarming,” he told me. “If one in 10 innocent people end up stopped with a gun pulled on them, that is a lot of potential for abuse.” Despite his role as a privacy advocate, Mr. Hofer isn’t afraid of technological innovation. His main concern is preserving the right to be anonymous in public. “If we allow law enforcement to rewind life and search through our every interaction, our relationship to public life is forever altered,” he said. “And I simply don’t understand the idea that if we use enough technology, we can achieve a zero percent crime rate. I reject that because that’s going to lead to extreme overpolicing.” Mr. Hofer hopes his lawsuit and continuing work will help slow the use of surveillance technology by showing how digital automated systems can have outsize impact in the physical realm. “They built a system to mitigate harm, and yet I ended up with guns pulled on me due to faulty data,” he said. “And it’s more proof that we’ve built this invisible layer behind the scenes that leads to real-world consequences.” This week’s archive pick is a fascinating February 2001 article on the trend of big online companies creating corporate privacy officers roles. As with last week’s archive, it’s a bit jarring to see how little things have changed in the privacy landscape over the past two decades. Take this description of the ad company DoubleClick: “DoubleClick, which distributes ads to consumers on thousands of Web sites, has taken a public beating from advocates for privacy rights, who contend that it tracks people’s online wanderings too intrusively. The company has consistently denied that its policies violate consumer privacy; the Federal Trade Commission recently dropped an inquiry, but it still faces class action suits and lawsuits by state attorneys general. And so DoubleClick is redoubling its efforts to build a reputation as a company that protects privacy.” In 2007, Google bought DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, which only further entrenched the tech giant’s position as the dominant player in online ads. There’s an undercurrent of hope running through the 2001 piece that the corporate world is turning a corner on online privacy, which reads as a bit depressing in 2019. There’s even hints of excitement that legislators are looking into the online ad space — “This issue is exploding in Washington,” a person says in the piece. As we know now, online ads never got that meaningful scrutiny. But no quote stood out as much as this hopeful passage from an I.T. professor: “Mary Culnan, a professor of management and information technology at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., said that ‘the game has changed,’ and corporations have moved from a time of sensationalistic exposés of privacy flaws to trying to figure out how to use personal information responsibly and with customer consent. ‘It’s not the sort of land mine blowing up any more,’ she said.” If anything, it’s a good reminder that we should probably always be wary of proclamations that “the game has changed.” We know that most websites and social media platforms constantly track us and share and store that information. And we also know that most of those companies offer the option to disable or “opt out” of data sharing and marketing services. But those preferences are often hard to find and buried deep in the bowels of obscure privacy pages. Thankfully, Troy Davis, a Seattle-based developer, created Simple Opt Out — a handy webpage that will help you disable these services for over 50 companies, including major retailers but also companies like Facebook and 23&Me. Here’s how he described the genesis of the site to me: “I created it because I discovered that Crate & Barrel sells not only its customers’ information to third parties, but also its customers’ purchase histories. Turns out that’s fairly common in the retail world. If you’ve used a retail point-of-sale system to buy something, a retailer has probably sold/rented/traded your purchase — with your contact info — to a third party.” You’ll still have to log into the websites yourself and change the appropriate settings, but the site is incredibly handy in that it organizes the links in one place. It’s a great way to take back a tiny bit of control or, at the very least, get a sense of what many companies are trying to siphon from you and your digital footprint. Your feedback will be a crucial part of the direction of this newsletter from week to week. You can send it here. And we’ll answer questions every week. Q: Do you have any advice for how to talk to friends and family about privacy? I know how to counter the “nothing to hide” argument with the following: “O.K., give me all your passwords then!” But past that, it’s sometimes hard to explain the problems that giving up your data introduces. My friends will say they don’t care about Facebook having their data, because they don’t know any employees at Facebook, so they’re not worried about embarrassment. How can we make privacy more personal? It seems to me like we need to find ways to make the harms more tangible on an individual level, but I don’t have enough examples in my back pocket. Would love any advice on how to have these more productive discussions. A: Making the digital privacy issue personal is a constant struggle. Here’s how one ad industry veteran put it to me: “People only care about privacy in the abstract — not in reality. I think it’s because often, it’s either privacy or spending money. They don’t want to pay for most of the services online. They’d rather have this low-grade anxiety than spend money.” But as I argued last week, I think that’s because people have a limited definition of privacy. It’s not just about data breaches or having access to their pictures or passwords. And one way to drive that point home to friends, family or anyone else is to show them not only how much information is being captured but also how that information is being sliced and diced and used to make value judgments about a person. I’d point your family members to a piece like this, where a woman looks at data collected about her and the categories they fall into: “My Mastercard UK shopping interests, for instance, includes travel and leisure to Canada (I have in fact been to Canada recently for work) and frequent transactions in Bagel Restaurants (I can remember one night out where I’ve purchased quite a few bagels). Others are Experian UK classifies me according to my assumed financial situation (for some inexplicable reason I’m classified as “City Prosperity:World-Class Wealth”), the data broker Acxiom even placed me in a category called ‘Alcohol at Home Heavy Spenders.’” Maybe your family members are O.K. with that information being collected by financial companies and credit agencies. But are they fine with those customers trading that information with other companies (often this happens without our knowledge)? Our current data dystopia isn’t just about forking over information; it’s also about how that information moves across the web and how it leaks to both neutral and bad actors. This Wall Street Journal article on online trust score companies. These companies are a sobering example of the secondary layer of the internet that we can’t see and that is gobbling up our information and making decisions that affect our lives. The Financial Times has a deep dive on facial recognition and the reasons for concern. In sum: It’s not just that your face might be in a database; it’s how the databases can get shared and how the purpose of that monitoring changes over time in ways that might affect your privacy. Here’s a thought-provoking piece on late-model cars and how they’re constantly collecting data on the way we drive, where we go and even personal information (weight, music tastes, etc.). This figure surprised me: “a car can generate about 25 gigabytes of data every hour and as much as 4,000 gigabytes a day, according to some estimates.” Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/highline/article/parkland/---split---Max Eden didn’t even want to read about Parkland. He saw the news on Valentine’s Day, after a dinner date with his girlfriend at a little French place in Washington, D.C., taking an Uber home. There was the gut-punch—“oh shit, another school shooting”—then the queasy afterthought that none of this hits as hard as it used to. He knew what would follow. For a few angry weeks, Democrats would demand gun control and Republicans would call for arming teachers. He decided he’d sit it out this time, ignore the news as much as possible. And for a few days he did, until a journalist tweeted that the shooter’s school record proved a point that Eden had been making for much of his career. At 30 years old, Eden has a neat beard, a balding head that he’s resigned himself to buzzing short and a quick, sometimes nervous intelligence. A Yale graduate, he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that focuses on economic and urban policy issues. For years, the institute has produced arguments about how liberal policies intended to help minorities actually hurt them. It underwrote the early welfare reform work of contrarian sociologist Charles Murray, whose book, “The Bell Curve,” infamously argued that there are racial differences in intelligence. Its senior fellow George Kelling helped advance the theory of “broken windows” policing, which posits that crackdowns on petty quality-of-life offenses ultimately reduce major crimes. More recently, fellow Heather Mac Donald has regularly appeared on Fox News to discuss the “Ferguson effect”—her argument that the Black Lives Matter movement has caused police to become less proactive, fueling urban crime. Eden’s portfolio was lower-profile. His speciality was education, which in conservative policy circles usually meant critiquing liberal reforms for focusing on underprivileged children at the expense of their more fortunate peers. (In 2016, he wrote an article to this effect titled “#AllKidsMatter.”) Eden’s mother had been a public school teacher in Cleveland, and her complaints made the work personal. For more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. Over the previous two years, Eden had focused on school discipline. The Obama administration had embarked on a major effort to address the “school-to-prison pipeline”—the glaring racial disparity in school suspensions and expulsions, which is a major contributor to an even more glaring racial disparity in America’s prisons. Eden believed the reforms had plunged schools like his mother’s into chaos and saw the reformers themselves as members of a “social justice industrial complex.” “As more money flows to ‘woke’ conferences and training programs,” he would write, “school district leaders have increasingly learned that the fastest path to career advancement is to produce fake statistical progress for minority students while passionately decrying privilege and institutional racism.” Eden tracked the news for violent incidents—like a 2017 high school stabbing in the Bronx—at schools that had adopted the new approach. Still, compared to other education debates that riled up conservatives, such as campus sexual assault or bathroom access for transgender students, discipline reform never really caught on. There was, Eden said, no natural Republican “political constituency” for his issue. Until a few days after Parkland, when the journalist’s tweet started him thinking. The shooting had occurred at the most elite public school in one of the most affluent suburbs in Broward County, and Eden typically focused on low-income, urban, majority-minority schools. But then he noticed what kids from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were saying about Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old former MSD student charged with killing 17 students and staff and injuring 17 more. In TV interviews and on social media, the students insisted they’d repeatedly warned local authorities that Cruz was obsessed with guns. A couple of days after the massacre, the FBI acknowledged it had failed to act on two tips. It would emerge that Cruz had repeated interactions with the Broward County Sheriff’s Office as well. Eden wondered, he told me, whether the shooting was connected to Broward’s reputation as “ground zero” for a policy he characterized as “try to arrest as few students as possible.” In 2013, Broward had launched an arrest- and suspension-diversion program called PROMISE that became a national model for reformers. Many believed it had even helped inspire the Obama administration’s own efforts. And when Eden tangled with reform advocates online, asking them to show him where the new policies were working, they always pointed to Broward. In the days after the shooting, Parkland students led the country in the most forceful call for gun reform in recent memory, and plenty of conservatives were looking to place the blame on anything other than lax gun laws. The first to land on PROMISE was Jack Cashill, the conspiracy-minded author of a book about “the railroading of George Zimmerman.” Cashill had long argued that Trayvon Martin, the black teenager whom Zimmerman shot and killed in 2012, was in fact a budding criminal whose aptitude for “street fighting, drugs, guns, burglary and mixed martial arts” had been obscured because his Florida school district participated in a program to reduce student arrests. Now, Cashill theorized that Broward had similarly excused Cruz because, although he is white, his name made him “a statistical Hispanic.” The next day, a right-wing blog posted a series of tweets arguing that Cruz had benefited from “the Trayvon Martin standard.” The thread was shared almost 12,000 times, and the theory quickly spread from Infowars to Rush Limbaugh to Breitbart to Fox News, until Ann Coulter was describing PROMISE as “the school to mass murder pipeline.” But it was Eden, whose work had been cited in the Senate, who made the argument influential. ( 1 ) CNN’s Jake Tapper also aggressively questioned Broward Sheriff Scott Israel about the potential role of the district's discipline policies. That exchange was overshadowed by Israel's claim that he provided “amazing leadership," although the only armed official stationed at MSD failed to intervene in the massacre. Twelve days after the shooting, Eden wrote an article for the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal, suggesting—in more measured terms than Cashill or Coulter—that Broward’s approach to school discipline might have allowed Cruz to “slip through the cracks.” Within days, Florida state Representative Richard Corcoran announced that he planned to propose legislation revoking Broward’s “no-arrest policy,” and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling on them to revise former President Barack Obama’s reforms. In the coming months, Eden would testify before Congress and speak to DeVos. In the conservative and mainstream press, his arguments helped to advance a narrative that he’d later acknowledge happened to be “very politically convenient” for conservatives: that the Parkland shooting “wasn’t guns, it was Obama.” And then, in April, he traveled to Parkland. Eden hoped to write an article about a failed policy—he wasn’t planning to get personally involved. But there were some in Parkland who found his arguments persuasive. The father of one slain MSD senior sought Eden out and declared that his work would be central to his search for “justice for my daughter’s murder.” It was the start of an unlikely partnership that would entangle a grieving community in one of the ugliest political fights that people in Broward could remember. Twenty years ago, the Columbine school shooting was the deadliest of its kind in U.S. history. As with the shooting in Parkland, no major gun reforms followed. And yet Columbine did prompt profound change of another, less obvious kind, as schools all over the country overhauled their safety procedures. In 1997, just 10 percent of public schools had campus-based police, known as school resource officers or SROs. By 2014, it was 30 percent. Between 1996 and 2008, the number of school districts that had their own police departments more than doubled. The purpose of these new practices was to protect students from violence. But what happened instead was the widespread criminalization of bad behavior. Before Columbine, some 79 percent of schools had zero tolerance policies for violence, according to the Department of Education; a federal law mandated a year’s suspension for bringing a gun on campus. After the shooting, schools rushed to expand these policies to lesser forms of misconduct. What was seen as a “weapon” expanded to the point of absurdity. Students were suspended or expelled for bringing butter knives in their lunchboxes, aiming “finger guns” or biting a Pop-Tart into what teachers interpreted as the shape of a gun. Arrest rates skyrocketed for vaguely defined offenses like “disruption.” (These arrests often escalated from behavior as minor as throwing pencils in class or running in halls.) In public schools with SROs, students were five times more likely to be arrested for “disorderly conduct” than at schools without them. Researchers eventually deemed that the new zero tolerance rules didn’t actually increase school safety. Meanwhile, even as juvenile crime rates steadily decreased after their 1994 peak, suspensions kept rising. ( 2 ) Annual student suspensions nearly doubled from 1974 to 2001, increasing from 1.7 million to 3.1 million over that time. The new precautions coincided with a heightened suspicion of teenagers in the mid-’90s, a fear that was often racialized. And it was students of color—especially black students, and especially black boys—who bore the brunt of the post-Columbine emphasis on school security. Black students account for around 15 percent of the public school population but around a third of school-based arrests. Even as preschoolers, black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended as their white peers, and twice as likely to be arrested at school, according to The Sentencing Project. In recent years, security cameras and student cellphones have captured shocking footage of black children on campus being manhandled like dangerous criminals—a teenage girl violently flipped over and thrown across the room by an SRO; a kindergartner handcuffed for a temper tantrum. Russell Skiba, a professor emeritus at Indiana University and a leading researcher on disparate discipline, noted that over 20 years, all but a handful of studies have found that the reason for the discrepancy isn't that black children are misbehaving at higher rates. Rather, black students are punished more for offenses that rely on subjective assessment, such as “disruptive behavior” or “defiance.” White students, meanwhile, are more often punished for objective offenses that can’t be ignored, like smoking or vandalism. Black students are also 31 percent more likely to receive discretionary suspensions, according to the Justice Center—that is, not for violations that would automatically mandate it. Many researchers largely attribute the problem to implicit bias: teachers, administrators and SROs judging the same behavior differently depending on the race of the child. One superintendent in Minnesota examined discipline referrals for her district’s kindergartens and found that when white kids misbehaved, teachers described them as high-strung or frustrated—unable to “use his words”—while black classmates were labeled unmanageable or violent. These experiences can alter the course of a student’s life. According to an authoritative 2011 study in Texas, children who are suspended are twice as likely as similar peers to drop out and 11 times more likely to become involved with the juvenile justice system. Other studies have found those who drop out are three times more likely to end up incarcerated. Broward was as good an example as any of this phenomenon. In 2011, the county had the most school arrests in Florida. As the nation’s sixth-largest district, this was perhaps not surprising—but 71 percent of those arrests were for misdemeanors like graffiti or possessing marijuana. According to the local NAACP, black students in Broward were two and a half times more likely than white students to be suspended, expelled and arrested. Their achievement gap was also stark. In 2011, only 57 percent of the district’s black male students graduated; several years earlier, the graduation rate for that group had been the third-worst in the country among districts with a large black population. Robert Runcie became Broward’s first permanent black superintendent in 2011. He wasn’t a career educator. A tall, wiry, driven man with a thin mustache, he’d grown up in a cinder-block house in Jamaica and emigrated with his working-class family to the U.S. when he was 6. He studied economics at Harvard and Northwestern and founded a technology consulting firm. In 2003, his college friend Arne Duncan, then the CEO of Chicago’s public schools, asked him to run the district’s data systems. There, he helped to work on an algorithm project to determine which students were at greatest risk of being harmed by gang violence. After his arrival in Broward, Runcie was contacted by a small core of leaders, convened by the local NAACP, that had been trying to address the school-to-prison pipeline. Runcie “was a data geek,” said Gordon Weekes, an attorney in Broward’s public defender’s office. “He said, ‘Whatever the data shows, it shows.’” When the data demonstrated that there were indeed significant racial disparities at work, the group assembled a coalition, joined by Runcie and various local agencies, including law enforcement, to review the district’s policies. The team was particularly intrigued by a model developed in the poorest school district in metro Atlanta. Over a 10-year span, the arrival of police in Clayton County schools had led to a 1,200 percent increase in school-based arrests, overwhelmingly for petty offenses. Black students were 12 times more likely than white ones to be arrested. Graduation rates fell to an all-time low and crime in the county increased. As Clayton Juvenile Judge Steve Teske explained, once children are pulled into the system, they begin to identify as delinquents and are desensitized to the threat of jail. Arrest a student for low-level misbehavior, Teske has said, and “you might as well be sending him to prison one day.” In 2004, Teske brokered a partnership between school and law enforcement in which arrests would be diverted for four minor offenses—fights, disorderly conduct, disruption and failure to follow police instructions. This led to a 70 percent drop in arrests and rising graduation rates. Georgia’s then-Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican and former juvenile judge, described Teske’s work as “revolutionary.” In 2013, Broward’s team expanded “the Teske model” into a program they called PROMISE (Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Support and Education). It covered 13 common types of misbehavior, including alcohol and marijuana possession, vandalism and “minor fighting.” Instead of being arrested for those offenses, students could be sent to one of the district’s alternative schools, Pine Ridge Education Center, for classes, counseling and a wide range of social services to address the underlying causes of misbehavior. Over the next four years, Broward’s school arrests fell 63 percent. An independent assessment by Nova Southeastern University, which offers counseling services in partnership with PROMISE, found that same-year recidivism dropped from 50 percent to 8 percent. The black male graduation rate, meanwhile, increased significantly. Runcie and his Executive Director of Student Support Initiatives, Michaelle “Mickey” Pope, were inundated with calls for advice from educators around the country. Runcie would eventually be invited to a White House panel that recognized Broward as leading the nation in discipline reforms. In January 2014, all public K-12 schools received a “Dear Colleague” letter from the departments of Justice and Education (the latter then led by Arne Duncan). Under the Civil Rights Act, the letter said, federally funded entities could not penalize students of one race disproportionately. Any “disparate impact” could be evidence of discrimination, even if policies were race-neutral on their face. The letter signaled that the education department’s Office of Civil Rights would investigate potential violations. The American Civil Liberties Union described the move as “groundbreaking”; dozens of states and school districts subsequently instituted reforms. Conservative critics like Eden objected on multiple fronts. ( 3 ) Conservative think tanks that follow education policy include the American Enterprise Institute, the Federalist Society and the Hoover Institution, as well as smaller organizations like the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, the Center for Equal Opportunity and the Center for the American Experiment. When DeVos held her first “listening session” on the Obama guidance, multiple members of this network attended. They argued that the guidance was federal overreach and that it changed the standard for discrimination from equal treatment to equal outcomes. Many were deeply skeptical of the restorative justice programs that replaced suspensions for certain offenses, or bristled at the implication that educators might harbor unconscious biases. They often cited a 2014 report that attributed the disparities to previous misbehavior (though Skiba said this study has methodological flaws). Some argued that the research didn’t prove that suspensions actually cause the negative outcomes cited by reformers. And then there were those who believed that minorities simply misbehave more often, as a result of poverty or single-parent homes. Eden’s Manhattan Institute colleague, Heather Mac Donald—whose books include “The Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture”—wrote in City Journal, “Given what we know about the breakdown of family socialization in the black community, it is wholly consistent that black students would be more prone to insubordination and classroom disruption.” ( 4 ) Multiple studies show that even black students from two-parent, middle- or upper-class homes are still disciplined at school more than their white counterparts. Somewhat more gently, Eden agreed: “I see dramatic disparities, but I think they’re baked into American society due to the American sin of slavery and generations of policies, whether well- or mal-intended, holding African American students to lower standards.” But mostly, conservatives complained that the letter forced schools into a dangerous numbers game. Eden characterized it this way: If three black students and one white student were suspended for swearing at a teacher, the school could be violating the guidance by producing a disparate outcome. As a result, he said, schools are compelled to “juke the stats”—borrowing the term from “The Wire,” a show that delivered a devastating indictment of broken windows policing and traditional disciplinary approaches in poor urban schools. To support his argument, Eden collected school surveys administered by officials or teachers unions. He found more than 10 large districts where teachers said discipline reform wasn’t working. In Oklahoma City, one teacher reported that the principal had said suspensions were no longer mandatory unless there was an incident involving blood. In other districts, some teachers reported feeling so distraught—by both the policy and the implication that they were racist if they objected to it—that they’d considered leaving the profession altogether. Eden’s most recognized work is a 2017 report claiming that after New York City enacted reforms, at 38 percent of schools an increased share of teachers said order and discipline had grown worse. However, education policy writer RiShawn Biddle took issue with the methodology. Biddle noted the raw survey data showed that, district wide, the proportion of teachers who thought order and discipline had been maintained actually remained steady, at 80 percent. (Eden also found that at 44 percent of schools, more students reported fighting than before.) Beyond that, Biddle said, there are inherent limitations to using survey responses as an objective measure of safety. He pointed to a 2016 study that found white teachers have lower expectations of their black students than do black teachers, as well as a 2015 study showing that black children are suspended less often when taught by black teachers. “Teachers, students, parents all have biases,” Biddle said. “You’re dealing with perception, and for many people, perception is reality.” After President Donald Trump was elected, Eden and other reform opponents had the ear of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Four months into the new administration, Eden wrote an op-ed urging DeVos to rescind the Obama letter. In the fall of 2017, a Federalist Society report accused reformers of transforming schools into “menacing places where gangs of out-of-control teens prowl the halls.” Soon afterward, DeVos hired the study’s co-author. In September, DeVos, who’d already withdrawn one Obama guidance concerning the rights of transgender students, announced she was pulling a second, concerning campus sexual assault. Conservatives clamored for her to keep going, with one think tank cheering, “Two Down, One to Go.” On April 10, 2018, at a meeting of the Broward County School Board, a slight, skinny kid walked up to the microphone and confidently announced that he’d completed an investigation into “the conduct of the school board and superintendent prior to the shooting at Stoneman.” Kenneth “Kenny” Preston was a 19-year-old home-schooled student in khaki pants and a dark blazer with a near-pompadour of black hair. He projected the same forceful, hyperarticulate poise that had propelled the MSD student activists into the spotlight nearly two months before, although he was at the meeting to make a very different point. Preston’s investigation had begun as a report for an online journalism course and it was now more than 3,000 words long. He focused on two charges. First, that Runcie had spent only 5 percent of a $100 million bond dedicated to safety improvements. (The district said far more than 5 percent had been allocated.) Second, that PROMISE and its champions had tied the hands of SROs, obscured the number of campus crimes and allowed more than 1,000 incarcerated students to re-enroll in district schools. ( 5 ) Under state and federal law, the school district must enroll all youth of compulsory education age, even those with felony convictions. Some are formally enrolled in schools for tracking purposes even when they’re being taught in a detention facility. After release, courts require the district to place them. Most end up in non-traditional settings, including online education, though Runcie said some may go to mainstream schools if they are determined to pose no threat. Preston quoted an anonymous former SRO who had told him, “we all knew some kind of tragedy like this was going to happen in Broward.” Several board members contested the accuracy of Preston’s findings, and Runcie lamented the spread of “fake news” about the school district. But within hours, Preston’s report was featured by The Hill; the next day he appeared on the radio show of National Rifle Association spokesperson Dana Loesch. Although conservative media treated the report as the work of an intrepid wunderkind, it wasn’t entirely a solo project. After the shooting at MSD, Preston had been incensed to see Runcie on television calling for “sensible gun control” before the dead had even been buried. After coming across Max Eden’s work online, he messaged him on Facebook to ask for help refining his presentation. “Our goal was to make [Runcie] the focus,” Preston told me—referring to what was already a small band of critics of the school district. Among them was Andrew Pollack, who had become what the Miami New Times would call “the Parkland massacre’s conservative face.” On February 14, Pollack’s daughter, Meadow, an MSD senior, had been shot nine times. The final five shots came as she attempted to cover the body of a schoolmate, Cara Loughran, who died when the bullets passed through Meadow’s body into her own. On the day of the shooting, Pollack had been on a Valentine’s Day bike ride with his wife in the Everglades. When they heard of the shooting, they sped back to the city and raced from hospital to hospital, looking for Meadow. At one point, they would later discover, they’d been driving behind the ambulance that was transporting Nikolas Cruz. That unspeakable day, Pollack had been photographed in a hospital parking lot, wearing a Trump 2020 T-shirt and holding up his phone to show a picture of Meadow beaming in a black strapless dress. A week later, Pollack stood up in a televised meeting at the White House, his tan face drawn, his two sons gripping his shoulders. He was “pissed,” he said. He couldn’t get on a plane with bottled water, “but some animal can walk into a school and shoot our children.” Pollack contended that gun control was a pipe dream and the country needed to unite around school safety solutions instead. In short order, he became a Fox News regular. A 53-year-old transplant from New York, who’d run a scrap metal dealership before getting into real estate, Pollack, with his salt-and-pepper buzz cut, has retained an accent and an attitude friends affectionately described as “Long Island redneck.” His 21-year-old son, Hunter, called him “a real tough guy.” Pollack called himself a business guy or a people guy or just a “real guy”—someone who, he frequently said, “barely graduated high school” but had common sense. In his first Fox News appearance, four days after the White House meeting, Pollack still looked shellshocked. He'd always seen Meadow, whom he'd named after Meadow Soprano, as the toughest of his three children, the one who seemed most like himself. When the host asked what he thought of the calls for gun control, Pollack accused him of “polarizing this event.” “You didn’t say one thing about fixing it!” he exclaimed. For Pollack, to “fix it”—a phrase he’d make his signature hashtag—meant fortifying schools like courthouses or airports. In subsequent Fox appearances, Pollack liked to observe that his opponents were driven by an agenda—trying to politicize his daughter’s death—but he was not for any party except the party of your kids coming home after school. Though he said he’d never tied a tie in his life before the shooting, he now wore suits almost daily for interviews or meetings with state legislators, governors, members of Congress, President Trump and Secretary DeVos. His social media following swelled to more than 120,000 people. His dog Sonny became a repeat attraction on the Twitter account “Conservative Pets.” Sometimes, Pollack marveled at the man he’d become. His daughter’s murder had empowered him. “I could walk through flames right now,” he said in that first interview on Fox. He sometimes referred to himself as “Mr. Pollack,” as in, “Nobody’s even looking at this except Mr. Pollack.” He almost always called his daughter’s killer by his inmate number, 18-1958. Despite his growing profile, Pollack read every message he received, afraid of missing a vital clue in his mission to expose what had gone wrong. So when Kenny Preston reached out to families of MSD victims about his report, Pollack rallied other parents to sign a letter to the school district, demanding answers. ( 6 ) After several sources quoted by Preston repudiated the final product, the families withdrew their signatures. He would later write that he told Preston, “Listen, I don’t give a fuck if it turns out you’re wrong. So what if it blows up in my face? ... I want to know everything, and you’re doing the right thing.” Back in Washington, Eden was also impressed by Preston’s tenacity. Preston had challenged the school board even after a two-hour meeting with Runcie, three victims’ families and 10 district officials, in what Preston saw as an attempt to “reeducate” him. “He’s my fucking American hero,” Eden told me. He viewed the school district’s reaction as a sign that it had something to hide and decided to go to Parkland himself, to see what he could find out. There, Eden met with 15-year-old Anthony Borges, who’d been shot five times while holding a classroom door closed to protect other kids. His family had sued the district, charging that PROMISE was part of a lenient “atmosphere of the whole school.” Borges had only recently been released from the hospital when Eden visited him in his bedroom. He had fresh surgical incisions healing on his wiry torso and a colostomy bag sticking out the side of his stomach. Eden hadn’t planned to talk to Pollack, who was so frequently on television, “pointing every finger at everything that was popping up.” Eden figured if he knew anything about PROMISE, he’d have said so, loudly. Plus, even from a distance, Pollack seemed “really intense.” But then Pollack invited Eden to his Spanish-tiled ranch house in Coral Springs. Pollack had joined the newly established Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, which was undertaking an exhaustive inquiry into the tragedy, and he wanted advice. Eden suggested he find out about Cruz’s disciplinary record—whether Cruz had committed any crimes he wasn’t arrested for. His contention was that if Cruz had been arrested at school, a criminal record could have prevented him from buying a gun. Pollack said he was told that the commission wasn’t sure whether the district had yet shared all the relevant records. He, too, sensed a cover-up. (The commission would later confirm the district had cooperated fully in sharing information.) Pollack made Eden an offer: If Eden would help him with an “independent investigation,” Pollack would introduce him to everyone he could find, put him up in his house for free, even reimburse his flights. Between April and September of 2018, Eden came down to Broward every several weeks. The independent investigation turned into a book that he and Pollack would write together. They made an odd pair: Eden’s cool, preppy eloquence and Pollack’s brash swagger. The two men had almost nothing in common—“I can't imagine any circumstances under which we would have struck up a friendship,” Eden said—yet they reached a point where each knew what the other would say about anything they found. They are both Jewish, said Eden, and that seemed significant. Pollack leaned into this idea, telling Eden their collaboration was “like a Moses and Aaron thing.” Pollack believed he was channeling something he couldn’t express, but that was why Eden was there—to help him find the words. He had come to see PROMISE, and everything it stood for, as key to the entire tragedy. As he put it: “The reason [Cruz] murdered my daughter and 16 other people was that the system around him was even sicker than he was.” At the Broward County School Board building, a high-rise in downtown Fort Lauderdale just steps from the courthouse, district officials couldn’t believe that PROMISE was becoming a scapegoat for the shootings. Chief Academic Officer Daniel Gohl started a spreadsheet to track the spread of the claims. At first, he said, the attacks seemed like “throwing spaghetti against the wall.” But then, they started to stick, maybe because PROMISE tapped into so many cultural divisions at once: debates about child-rearing and which kids are dangerous, suspicions that the Obama administration had favored minorities, and simmering racial and political tensions within Broward itself. As the strongest Democratic county in the state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1, Broward conservatives bitterly resented what they saw as monolithic liberal power. Runcie’s tenure in Broward had been complicated by some of his efforts to combat inequality: A decision to transfer a star principal from an A-rated suburban school to an F-rated inner-city institution had rankled. Runcie himself viewed the attacks on PROMISE as part of a Trump-era push to undo anything associated with Obama—even if “what we put here in Broward County had nothing to do with the Obama administration.” He found himself starring in Parkland conspiracy theories, including one that accused him of working with Sheriff Scott Israel (and Obama, and Hillary Clinton) to let Cruz loose in order to facilitate a gun grab. The Borges’ family attorney, Eden later wrote, told him he’d learned about PROMISE from a blog that urges traditionalist Christians to migrate to a “Redoubt” of survivalist communities in Idaho and that blamed PROMISE in part on George Soros. Like a constant drumbeat below these claims was the knowing repetition that Runcie hailed from Chicago. After a while, noted Runcie, who said he spent the first few weeks after the shooting working 15-hour days, seven days a week, “I stopped looking at all the stuff from what I call ‘the crazies.’” A week after Preston’s school board speech, a community forum was convened at a local high school. Nearly two months after the shooting, it was clear there had been real and systemic failures across multiple agencies. The FBI and Broward County Sheriff’s Office hadn’t followed up on obvious warnings, including a tip about a YouTube video in which Cruz allegedly declared he was “going to be a professional school shooter.” Sheriff's officers had contact with Cruz’s family 43 times since 2008, but he’d never been arrested. ( 7 ) Only half the visits involved Nikolas; most were for relatively minor issues. Two substantial reports were overlooked: a social media threat and a family friend's warning that he “might be a Columbine in the making.” There was also the inaction of the SRO posted at Stoneman Douglas on the day of the shooting and the fact that multiple staff hadn’t confronted Cruz or called a “Code Red” lockdown. But when it came time for parents, students and teachers to voice their anger, PROMISE was a recurring target. A teacher from South Plantation who’d lost a loved one at MSD said the program had “created a safe haven for criminals in our schools.” A father of three Parkland students waved a copy of a disciplinary document, claiming that it allowed “students convicted of rape and murder to sit next to our kids.” Runcie and other district employees tried to explain that the program was used for only 2 to 3 percent of all student behavioral offenses and that 90 percent of its graduates weren’t repeat offenders. ( 8 ) One of Eden and Pollack's most effective attacks was that the district only counted repeat offenses if they occurred in the same school year. A district analysis found that in 2017 to 2018, of nearly 2,000 PROMISE attendees, only 46 had more than two offenses. Tim Sternberg, a former assistant principal at the school where PROMISE is based, also claimed the district classified recidivism as a second violation of the same offense, theoretically meaning a student could commit all 13 PROMISE-eligible offenses in a year without being considered a repeat offender. Although this claim appeared in news reports, Runcie and Pope said it had never been true. A black teenager, dressed sharply in a dress shirt, suspenders and bow tie, came to the mic to say he’d attended PROMISE after a drug offense, and it had opened his eyes—that “every day someone was talking about life choices.” But none of that seemed to matter, as dozens of speakers lined up for more than an hour. A mother suggested that when the district hired security contractors, it favored “minority and diversity outreach” vendors over those with safety expertise. Members of the audience shouted: “Where is the money?” One father told Runcie he’d watched him during the Pledge of Allegiance and hadn’t seen his lips move. Runcie clenched his jaw and said nothing. Kenny Preston took the mic again, more combative than the week before. “I don’t want a runaround,” he admonished Runcie. When Preston called for the district to vote out the existing board and elect new leadership, the applause in the room was deafening. The city of Parkland is a pristine, almost antiseptic landscape of more than two dozen interlocking gated communities. For years, strict zoning laws prohibited the construction of any stores within its limits. In 2017, it was named the safest city in Florida. Marjory Stoneman Douglas, nestled amid the pink stucco, palm trees and man-made lakes, had long been considered the district’s most desirable school. Many months after the shooting, messages of support were still draped on the buildings surrounding MSD. Gauzy purple bows hung from the trees lining the school driveway; #MSDStrong T-shirts were everywhere. Bereaved parents who’d been counseled to stay busy created foundations in their children’s names, made rubber bracelets with different colors for the victims, became lay experts on ballistics or metal detectors. Whenever Eden visited, he stayed in a house that felt haunted. Earlier that spring, the far fence of the Pollacks’ backyard tennis court had been interwoven with pink tape spelling Meadow’s name, for a memorial playground fundraiser. The tape remained there for months, a physical reminder of her absence, alongside subtler reminders, like the part of the fence that was damaged when a tree fell on it but never got repaired. Every morning, Eden and Pollack walked to Pollack’s favorite cafe in a nearby retail strip for breakfast. Eden spent his days interviewing MSD teachers, administrators, students and parents. He found he could only stay in Parkland for a few nights at a time. Talking with traumatized people and learning more about Cruz left him feeling exhausted and dirty. He watched one source, a teacher who’d been at the school that day, sink into depression. He couldn’t sleep at all in Broward, nor well in Washington—only in his childhood bed at his parents’ home in Cleveland. So that summer he flew in a triangle, from Broward to Cleveland to Washington, then back for another round. Pollack, meanwhile, could never turn off. “With Andy, it’s the same at 7:30 a.m. as it is at 11 p.m. as it is at 3 p.m.,” Eden said. “I don’t think he can do anything else.” “This is my life now,” Pollack would tell reporters—so many reporters he couldn’t remember whom he’d spoken to. That summer, Pollack threw himself into the campaign to oust Runcie. At a backyard barbecue with other MSD families, Preston, Pollack and others brainstormed candidates. They hoped to elect three to four new school board members to form a five-seat majority that could unseat Runcie and shut down PROMISE. Preston and Pollack met with Lori Alhadeff and Ryan Petty, two parents of Parkland victims. ( 9 ) Fourteen-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff, the captain of her soccer team, and Alaina Petty, a Junior ROTC cadet, were killed in the same English class. Pollack also approached Richard Mendelson, a former MSD social studies teacher and wrestling coach who teaches in the psychology graduate program at Fort Lauderdale’s Keiser University. Mendelson had been a close friend of Aaron Feis, one of three MSD coaches killed by Cruz. Soon after the shooting, he wrote Pollack to offer his support, and after the idea of running was proposed, he quickly agreed. His opponent would be Laurie Rich Levinson, who had signed the original PROMISE agreement as a representative of the school board. The battle lines couldn’t have been clearer. The anti-Runcie forces got an early boost in May, when a local NPR station reported that Cruz had been referred to PROMISE, despite Runcie’s repeated assurances otherwise. Runcie’s staff returned to their records—distributed across 17 different data systems, plus paper archives—and eventually found that during the first month of PROMISE’s existence, in November 2013, an eighth-grade Cruz had been referred for breaking a bathroom faucet. They couldn’t confirm whether he’d actually attended. Later, even some of the most vehement critics, including Eden, would admit that it was probably some kind of records mishap. ( 10 ) At most, Cruz’s absence was potentially missed by different data systems that weren’t synced in 2013. At the least, the district said, his referral may have been one of many automatically generated options, lingering in the system as a sort of digital ghost. But to Pollack, it was hard proof that Runcie, “a guy with a Harvard education,” had intentionally misled the people of Parkland. A week later, Petty and Alhadeff jointly announced that they were challenging two school board members as an explicit rebuke to the district. I met Alhadeff, a teacher turned stay-at-home mother, in the empty banquet room of her gated community’s clubhouse. She recalled how at the shiva for her daughter, “hundreds” of people told her, “we want change, we want change”—but then were unwilling to do anything. “It just became very clear to me that I needed to be able to step up,” she said. Both Alhadeff and Petty called for school security improvements, like bulletproof doors, and vowed to review PROMISE. Petty tweeted that such programs created “perverse incentives” for schools, while Alhadeff told reporters that the district had swung from “over-disciplining kids to not disciplining kids at all.” Eden said Pollack had sometimes struggled to grasp his systemic arguments about school discipline reform—how the specifics of Cruz’s story connected to Eden’s broader thesis. But Pollack’s quest for “accountability” became all-consuming. In June, Pollack learned that the school guard who’d failed to confront Cruz ( 11 ) By then, Cruz had been banned from campus; the guard, Andrew Medina, knew him as “crazy boy.” had almost been fired the year before, over allegations that he’d sexually harassed several students. One was Meadow. The guard, who denied the accusations, had received a three-day suspension. Pollack was enraged to discover that he was still working at MSD. ( 12 ) Pollack said he and two other fathers complained to MSD. Medina was not rehired for the 2018-2019 school year. That, Eden recalled, was when the culture of Broward schools became a “cosmic problem” for his friend. Pollack stepped down from the MSD safety commission and took on the management of Mendelson’s campaign. Mendelson seems to relish the incongruity of his large, boisterous bearing and his fondness for intellectual debate—a bookish jock. We met at a Starbucks, along with Ray Feis, the younger brother of his late friend, Aaron. Ray has the same bald head and glasses as his brother, the same ruddy coloring and red beard. He’d lived next door to Aaron but had sold his house after the shooting. “It just didn't feel right, seeing other people move in and him not being there, you know,” he told me. During our conversation, Mendelson turned to a coffee-stained copy of a Broward policy document to argue that “even capital offenses”—like rape and murder—“are considered school-based discipline issues now.” ( 13 ) Broward schools don't handle major crimes. Mendelson seemed to be referencing a district policy outlining how schools should meet their legal obligation to educate all children, including those with criminal records. The issue of school discipline was finally attracting national attention among conservatives. In mid-July, Pollack and Preston traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak at the high school leadership summit of Turning Point USA. The pro-Trump group had recently named an MSD student as its high school outreach coordinator. ( 14 ) Kyle Kashuv thrilled NRA fans by tweeting videos of himself shooting an AR-15. When his schoolmates rallied at the March for Our Lives, Kashuv told "Face the Nation" that Parkland students like him were being ignored. He and Preston wrote an op-ed calling for Runcie’s resignation. At the TPUSA event—which offered scholarships to cover expenses for MSD students—Senator Marco Rubio introduced Pollack in a video. Pollack called on the audience to volunteer for Mendelson’s campaign, calling it “the single most important political race in 2018.” Pollack had also gained an unlikely ally in Tim Sternberg, a former assistant principal at Pine Ridge, where the PROMISE program is housed. Sternberg believed, he said, in dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. But he’d come to view PROMISE as disorganized and ineffective. (In addition, he claimed to Eden, he’d been passed over for two promotions that went to black candidates.) When Sternberg resigned in 2017, he sent a flurry of emails to Runcie and others about what he saw as the program’s shortcomings but was unsatisfied with the responses. Even though Sternberg believed the program was ultimately salvageable, he began sharing information with Eden and Pollack. “I started almost joining a bandwagon of ‘PROMISE, PROMISE, PROMISE,’” he said. The MSD safety commission tried to calm the furor. In mid-July 2018, its chair, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, emphatically declared to reporters that PROMISE was “completely irrelevant, it's a rabbit hole, it's a red herring, it's immaterial.” But there was too much anger swirling around the school district and its officials, some of it stemming from unrelated grievances. The district had sometimes appeared less than forthcoming with the press or public. Promised security updates had been delayed, and family members of the victims accused the district of doing a poor job of attending to survivors’ needs. One victim’s mother, who was also a Broward elementary principal, initially wasn’t paid when she took bereavement leave. That summer, a Sun Sentinel investigation found that MSD—like many other Florida schools—had underreported campus crime, in order to attract or retain students. And, in August, the Sun Sentinel discovered that an outside consultant had found serious failures in how the district—as well as other local agencies—had handled Nikolas Cruz. According to Cruz’s mother, he had suffered from autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under federal disability law, Cruz was supposed to have access to the most mainstream educational environment possible. After being sent to Cross Creek, a school for students with intensive behavioral issues, in middle school, he’d done well enough to be transitioned to MSD by 10th grade. However, when he was 18, district staff had incorrectly allowed him to forfeit his disability status in order to stay at MSD, even though he’d displayed disturbing signs of needing help, including bringing dead animals and bullets to school, cutting himself and discussing suicide attempts. In the eyes of the district, he was now a general education student and ultimately had to withdraw after failing classes. Days later, he bought the AR-15 he’d use to kill his classmates. When his mother later tried to re-enroll him in Cross Creek, the district failed to follow through. Even MSD families who didn’t share Pollack’s politics, or his focus on PROMISE, began to join the calls for Runcie’s ouster. One of the most high-profile was Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was Cruz’s second-to-last victim. Guttenberg had become a full-time advocate for gun control after Jaime’s death. He tweeted that Runcie had “lost the faith” of those he was supposed to lead and that the school board needed a “wholesale makeover.” An already ugly race turned uglier. “Oust Runcie” bumper stickers, in MSD colors, proliferated around Parkland, although some critics referred to the superintendant as “Duncie.” On Twitter, Mendelson wrote that the election was “good versus evil” and would decide whether children “will return home safely each afternoon.” He hinted to me that Broward’s problems were partly caused by its mistaken focus on diversity. “If you were to look at the demographics of people who have been advanced into leadership roles in the past decade, as opposed to the general populace, you would see a vast difference, because they misinterpret what diversity means here,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m comfortable going further than that because I wouldn’t want the implications of that to be put in print with my name next to it.” When early voting started in mid-August, Mendelson’s and Levinson’s volunteers set up camp across from each other at polling stations. Pollack was a daily fixture at one, often showing up with his dog. Ray Feis manned the table at another location daily with his younger sister. He’d been undone by Aaron’s death, friends said, and had quit his job as a manager at a pool repair company to focus on the campaign. Almost every day, the police were called to polling stations following accusations of harassment from both camps. Levinson said that Mendelson volunteers called her a murderer with blood on her hands. Ray Feis in turn claimed that when he introduced himself to Levinson’s husband, “he started cursing me out.” (Mendelson said, “I cannot speak to every polling site, but where I was located, this simply did not happen.” Levinson said on behalf of her husband, “He did not use any curse words. He wouldn’t shake his hand because of what they were saying about his wife all day.”) One day, two deputies questioned Mendelson, responding to complaints that supporters had been heard screaming at voters, “You don’t care about my brother.” In Fort Lauderdale, the officials who’d created PROMISE repeated a sentiment so often it seemed like a mantra: that this was grief, and grief was a process, and that they had to respect that process no matter what form it took. Sometimes, though, respecting the process made it hard to defend themselves. At public forums where he or PROMISE were frequently attacked, Runcie’s face was a mask of calm: listening and nodding; responding in measured tones; biting his tongue when attacked; making himself available to talk even as critics claimed in viral videos that he was ignoring them. One-on-one, he was considerably more exasperated. “Hell yeah,” there were kindergartners in the PROMISE program who could have otherwise gotten arrest records for having tantrums, he told me. This “law enforcement criminalization mentality,” he said, “man, we know that doesn’t work.” Runcie argued that the real problem wasn’t excessive leniency, but that Broward’s disciplinary standards were still unevenly applied. Broward’s wealth distribution is often described as following a roughly east-west axis, dividing Fort Lauderdale and other eastern communities that struggle with urban poverty from wealthy western suburbs like Parkland. Multiple educators told me they suspected that, contrary to public perception, it was the wealthy western schools that were most likely to underreport infractions. “You’ve got a lot of people in the communities that make the most noise about our discipline,” said Runcie. And yet, “they’re the very first ones to come in and say, you know, John or Sally is a great straight-A student; they’re going to be graduating this year and we don’t need some discipline record that will taint their chances.” Those are the schools, he continued, where parents mediate off-the-record resolutions to fights or bring in lawyers to contest a three-day suspension. “Think about that,” he continued. “What kid in a middle-class or poor community [can] get an attorney to show up with their parent at school and say, ‘I need this taken care of’?” Weekes, the public defender who helped develop PROMISE, argued that administrators need the discretion to say, “‘I know this kid and this kid’s mom just lost her house or got a divorce—they acted up for two days after that.’” But, he went on, “We want that to happen across the board, with all children. And it wasn’t happening so much with children of color.” There are no hard numbers measuring how many students get these kinds of informal second chances. ( 15 ) Runcie said the district has introduced an audit process that includes scanning employee emails for unreported incidents. But in a state where every school gets graded, and real estate prices reflect those grades, said Daniel Gohl, the district’s chief academic officer, “I see how we set up a system that pits schools against each other and doesn’t treat data neutrally.” Tim Sternberg sometimes worried about what would happen if his new friends in the anti-PROMISE brigade got what they wanted. “Then what?” he asked. “Then we’re back to kids being arrested at 10, 11 years old? The kids in the west will continue getting away with what they get away with, because that’s what they’ve always done, and the administrators in the east will do what they do, so those kids all get arrested?” Runcie looked increasingly exhausted. His own children had received death threats at their schools or jobs. Over the years, he had taught himself to cope with trauma: As a child, his mother had been shot in the face in a hate crime while he sat beside her on their front porch. In Chicago, 300 to 400 students in his district were shot every year. “You need to find ways to create positive things out of tragedy,” he said, “or you go around creating more tragedy.” The idea of responding to the Parkland shooting by throwing the book at students for offenses that didn’t endanger school safety struck him as morally wrong. “If that’s what we’ve gotta do,” he said, “then I’m just not gonna do this work.” On August 28, election night, the Mendelson camp gathered at a Coral Springs restaurant to wait for the returns, feeling sure of victory. They’d raised over $40,000, knocked on 50,000 doors. “How could you not vote this man in?” one supporter asked. “He was going to be the savior of this community.” But when the results came in, Levinson had won with 56 percent of the vote. (Lori Alhadeff won her race, while Ryan Petty did not.) MSD students who’d volunteered on Mendelson’s campaign were weeping, as were some of the adults. “I don’t know the last time that I cried before these candidates lost the school board race,” said Eden, who described the campaign as a joint effort, despite his intentions to maintain “journalistic detachment.” Pollack found himself filled with disgust. In a county that had become synonymous with contested elections, he doubted the veracity of the results. But then, he reasoned, it was par for the course in the “politically correct cesspool” that was Democratic Broward. He put his house up for sale. “I gave it my all,” he told me, “and now it’s just like, let Rome burn, let Broward burn.” Pine Ridge Education Center, where the PROMISE program is housed, is a bustling, friendly place. When I visited last October, kids and their parents waited for appointments in the front office, which was decorated with gigantic, candy-colored blowups from the Dr. Seuss book “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Most of the high school students were there for fighting or marijuana possession. In one class I attended, they worked in clusters to answer questions about substance addiction. In a room across the hall, middle school children plugged missing words into sentences on the blackboard about self-esteem and bullying. The week before, Mickey Pope, the Broward school official, had taken a local mayor on a tour of the school. She said the mayor had been taken aback to discover elementary school students there—like many others, she'd thought PROMISE was for chronic delinquents, or at least much older kids. When they encountered a 5-year-old attendee, the mayor knelt beside him. “Baby, why are you here?” she asked. “I was bad,” the boy told her. He’d gotten mad and started crying, then kicked his teacher when she tried to take him to the office. (Before PROMISE, Pope said, he could have been arrested for battery of a school board employee.) The attacks on PROMISE had left its staff demoralized and depressed. Dr. Henry Brown, Pine Ridge’s principal, had come back to work early after having open heart surgery to throw a small party for his staff, in an attempt to cheer them up. He reminded them to stay focused on the students, but it was difficult. There was already a perception that theirs was a bad school, full of bad kids, and now that perception had hardened along racial lines. Black parents, he said, continued to see PROMISE “as an opportunity to help their child from becoming another statistic,” while vehement opponents had little understanding of the program or the students it served. PROMISE students, he said, included kids in foster care, kids facing the possible deportation of a parent, kids shouldering outsize responsibilities while their parents worked multiple jobs. One fourth grader had recently wanted to set up a lemonade stand so her mother could find someplace to live. Laura Kolo, a coordinator who’d been with PROMISE since its second year, insisted that contrary to the criticisms, the program did have a curriculum and a structure, one that had been vastly transformed since its inception. Students rarely returned more than once, and the majority of those that did were in elementary or middle school—not the dangerous teens depicted in public debate. When “high alert cases” came in—students who required more intensive intervention than PROMISE could provide—the public didn’t see the effort that went into connecting them with social services, therapy and legal help. “We would say, ‘Come visit! Look what we’re doing, the lives that we’re changing,’” said Kolo. “Sometimes the kids are good, sometimes they’re not so good. That’s what we’re dealing with.” But, she said, the critics never came. The battle over PROMISE had rattled its creators, too. A month after the school board election, the district’s Schoolhouse to Jailhouse Pipeline Committee held its quarterly meeting. Before the shooting, its members used to talk about how to make the program better, poring over data about patterns for various offenses. These days, their work was inevitably derailed by conversations about preventing another shooting—a crucial subject, but not the committee’s responsibility. From a corner of the table, Gordon Weekes interjected wearily: “We’re here to talk about minor school-based misbehavior.” It was important, he felt, not to let the kids who needed PROMISE get lost in the aftermath of the tragedy. For Weekes, the situation was particularly fraught. He had helped develop PROMISE, but, as a member of the public defender’s office, he was also part of Cruz’s legal team. On the day of the shooting, he’d been one of two staffers sent to address the media and had broken down on national television while noting the number of the victims. In his role as Cruz’s co-counsel, Weekes had criticized the district for “all the missed opportunities in this matter.” When I spoke to him in September, he couldn’t discuss whether he believed Broward had a culture of leniency, he said, because that might be “a pivotal issue in our case.” In other words, as part of Weekes’ legal duty to explore every avenue of defense in a death penalty case, he might have to attack the operation of a program he believed in, deeply, for everything it had done for Broward’s students of color. Another committee member, Judge Elijah Williams, observed that it was Columbine that had prompted a larger police presence in schools in the first place. “That’s how we got into this mess,” he said. It had taken 10 years, as thousands of kids were needlessly funnelled into the criminal justice system, for schools to address the harm that was being done. Now, Williams lamented, the post-Parkland clamor for more school guards threatened to land them right back where they’d started. As the first anniversary of the Parkland shooting drew near, the community planned moments of silence and days of service to honor their dead. At the time, Eden wondered whether Pollack, who’d poured his grief almost entirely into his battles, was having trouble accepting that “there’s only so much that can be fought, and we’ve just about reached the end of it.” Pollack sold his house and went on the road in his camper. In 2018, he’d promoted an initiative, named for Aaron Feis, to install more armed guards in public schools; one county training included a virtual reality simulation in which potential guards practiced shooting a gunman on campus. Now, Pollack met with police chiefs across Florida to warn them against programs like PROMISE. In an interview on NRATV, he declared he would “take [Runcie] out if it’s the last thing I do on earth.” “Him or the PROMISE program,” he told me. “One of them is going to go.” In early February, the Sun Sentinel reported that the former MSD security guard who failed to confront Cruz had requested a protective order against Pollack. He said that Pollack came to a youth baseball practice he was coaching, shouting that he wasn’t through with him yet. (“It's not accurate. I showed up at the game because I couldn’t believe that those parents would let their kids be coached by a guy like that,” Pollack said. “I wasn’t heckling him. I just told him that I have my lawsuit and that I’m not through with it and him yet.”) In late 2018, Eden and Pollack finished their book, “Why Meadow Died.” Due out later this year, the book delivers Eden’s policy arguments in Pollack’s everyman voice. They hadn’t tried to interview Runcie or visit Pine Ridge. But the book’s seventh chapter opens with a surprising line: “The fact that the PROMISE program is a farce is interesting and noteworthy, but it bears little direct relevance to the tragedy.” In late December, the MSD safety commission had come to the same conclusion. Buried beneath its unexpected recommendation to allow arming teachers, the commission’s report found that even if Cruz had been referred for arrest in 2013 over the broken bathroom faucet, Florida law would have mandated his immediate release to his mother. In addition, any record Cruz might have received for such a minor offense wouldn’t have prevented him from buying a gun. “I’ve been battling this for eight, nine months,” said Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, MSD safety commission chair, at one school board meeting. “People say, well, if he’d been arrested that would have prevented him from being able to purchase the firearms. That is 100 percent false and not true whatsoever.” After finishing the book, Eden began emphasizing to me a point he hadn’t made before: that in his initial City Journal op-ed, he had never actually mentioned the word “PROMISE.” He told me he had only intended to suggest that its potential role was a question someone should answer. Now, he was worried that his book would be dismissed as the NRA counternarrative, and that, if DeVos withdrew the Obama discipline guidance, newspaper headlines would read: “Unconnected effort to reduce discrimination is a casualty of the Parkland shooting.” He began saying that the criticisms of PROMISE had been caricatured and that to claim the program was the sole cause of the massacre “would be a dumb argument indeed.” In truth, Eden had come to view the Parkland shooting as more complex than he’d originally understood. Now, he said, he saw it as a story of intersecting institutional failures, less about excessive leniency alone and more about how schools handle students with extreme behavioral disabilities. The policy pressures to place Cruz in the most mainstream classroom setting possible, he contended, combined with the expense of special education, had prevented Cruz from being placed in the alternative school setting he needed. (Runcie said cost is "not part of the conversations" when specialists determine the best educational placement for students.) It was an argument that raises important questions, but also one less amenable to electric reaction. Balancing the right of students with disabilities to reach their full potential against the rights of other students to learn without disruption is a challenge everywhere, and even more so at schools like MSD. One of Pollack’s and Mendelson’s most outspoken volunteers proudly told me how she’d forced a principal to put her special-needs son in regular classes so that he wouldn’t pick up bad habits from the kids in special ed. As Eden acknowledged, it’s an issue that “doesn’t cut super neatly either way.” But by the time Eden had reached this conclusion, his hoped-for goal had been achieved. In December, DeVos and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker officially withdrew the Obama guidance. As a result, some school districts may repeal their reforms and the Department of Education will likely be less aggressive in investigating alleged discrimination. And on February 13, a day before the anniversary of the shooting, Florida’s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, whom Pollack had campaigned for, called for a grand jury investigation into whether the school district bore any responsibility for the shooting. In addition, he ordered a statewide audit of all diversion programs, specifically naming PROMISE. ( 16 ) In February, the Broward County Chiefs of Police Association notified Runcie it no longer supported PROMISE “based on the manner in which the program is being implemented.” That month, the school board approved changes, including a cap on referrals; better information-sharing with law enforcement; and an automatic threat assessment, involving police, of students who commit more than one misdemeanor. That month, the movement to fire Runcie also came to its heated conclusion. On February 25, the district held its third town hall meeting on school safety. Kenny Preston was there, and so was Tim Sternberg, who’d recently announced his own candidacy for the board, championing Pollack’s #fixit slogan. It might have been a replay of all the other meetings—but this time, Runcie had defenders: more than 1,000 people attended, many from other parts of Broward, many of them black. Some came on church buses. Some may have been alerted by an email sent by a district employee, who described the rhetoric coming from Parkland as “like nothing that has been seen since desegregation orders were enforced”—a characterization that angered many critics. Runcie’s supporters expressed condolences to the grieving families but said their side of town hadn’t been represented in the debates over the last year. The vice mayor of West Park condemned “people who are pimping the pain of the victims” for political or personal vendettas. A state senator who represents parts of eastern Broward declared, “Just as strongly as you feel about getting rid of Bob Runcie, we feel just as strong that it ain’t going to happen.” Fred Guttenberg spoke, wearing a shirt bearing Jaime's name and evidently distressed. “The bullet that shot my daughter did not know what color she was,” he said, jabbing his finger in the air. “And I’m frustrated as hell at what’s happening in this room tonight to make this about color and socioeconomic status.” But for many of the black attendees at the town hall, the attacks on PROMISE had always been about color. After the meeting, online Runcie critics wrote that “the ‘bused’ people” had “taken over” the meeting and left no room for “legitimately concerned parents.” Pollack tweeted that Runcie was “trying to spark racial conflict” in “a demented effort to save his job.” After a school board meeting the next day, Lori Alhadeff called for a vote on whether to fire Runcie for “willful neglect of duty.” The vote took place on March 5. Hundreds of people spilled into the halls and two overflow rooms. Over more than four hours, five people spoke in favor of Runcie’s termination, including one victim’s father. Eighty spoke in his defense, including local politicians, educators, clergy and two black mothers of MSD survivors. Many emphasized that Parkland was not the only community that had lost, or stood to lose, its children. “We grieved for you in a way that you’ll never understand,” said one man with a soft Caribbean accent. “It ripped our hearts open.” Others spoke of the need to move on. Runcie’s wife, Diana, spoke last. She recalled her husband coming home the night of the shooting, crying, and telling her, “I can’t believe I lost my babies.” Alhadeff’s motion lost, 6-3. Runcie would stay. He told me that he hoped the district could harness all that passion from the meetings to find a way forward. To him, the fight over PROMISE had raised “a big philosophical question [about] what we mature into as a society, how we raise our kids, how we develop human beings. Do we recognize that all our fates are connected together? That what happens to you ultimately is somehow going to impact me?” But a year after the shooting, not all shared such an optimistic view. Parents who’d become close in the immediate aftermath of the shooting had become estranged over political differences; the county seemed more polarized than ever before. At that final town hall, Fred Guttenberg took stock of the situation with a muted, weary anger: “My daughter is dead, and this community is coming apart.”

---split---7.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bias-predict-death/---split---Includes: Earlier this month the University of Nottingham published a study in PloSOne about a new artificial intelligence model that uses machine learning to predict the risk of premature death, using banked health data (on age and lifestyle factors) from Brits aged 40 to 69. This study comes months after a joint study between UC San Francisco, Stanford, and Google, which reported results of machine-learning-based data mining of electronic health records to assess the likelihood that a patient would die in hospital. One goal of both studies was to assess how this information might help clinicians decide which patients might most benefit from intervention. Amitha Kalaichandran, M.H.S., M.D., is a resident physician based in Ottawa, Canada. Follow her on Twitter at @DrAmithaMD. The FDA is also looking at how AI will be used in health care and posted a call earlier this month for a regulatory framework for AI in medical care. As the conversation around artificial intelligence and medicine progresses, it is clear we must have specific oversight around the role of AI in determining and predicting death. There are a few reasons for this. To start, researchers and scientists have flagged concerns about bias creeping into AI. As Eric Topol, physician and author of the book Deep Medicine: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, puts it, the challenge of biases in machine learning originate from the "neural inputs" embedded within the algorithm, which may include human biases. And even though researchers are talking about the problem, issues remain. Case in point: The launch of a new Stanford institute for AI a few weeks ago came under scrutiny for its lack of ethnic diversity. Then there is the issue of unconscious, or implicit, bias in health care, which has been studied extensively, both as it relates to physicians in academic medicine and toward patients. There are differences, for instance, in how patients of different ethnic groups are treated for pain, though the effect can vary based on the doctor's gender and cognitive load. One study found these biases may be less likely in black or female physicians. (It’s also been found that health apps in smartphones and wearables are subject to biases.) In 2017 a study challenged the impact of these biases, finding that while physicians may implicitly prefer white patients, it may not affect their clinical decision-making. However it was an outlier in a sea of other studies finding the opposite. Even at the neighborhood level, which the Nottingham study looked at, there are biases—for instance black people may have worse outcomes of some diseases if they live in communities that have more racial bias toward them. And biases based on gender cannot be ignored: Women may be treated less aggressively post-heart attack (acute coronary syndrome), for instance. When it comes to death and end-of-life care, these biases may be particularly concerning, as they could perpetuate existing differences. A 2014 study found that surrogate decisionmakers of nonwhite patients are more likely to withdraw ventilation compared to white patients. The SUPPORT (Study To Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments) study examined data from more than 9,000 patients at five hospitals and found that black patients received less intervention toward end of life, and that while black patients expressed a desire to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with their doctors, they were statistically significantly less likely to have these conversations. Other studies have found similar conclusions regarding black patients reporting being less informed about end-of-life care. Yet these trends are not consistent. One study from 2017, which analyzed survey data, found no significant difference in end-of-life care that could be related to race. And as one palliative care doctor indicated, many other studies have found that some ethnic groups prefer more aggressive care toward end of life—and that this may be related to a response to fighting against a systematically biased health care system. Even though preferences may differ between ethnic groups, bias can still result when a physician may unconsciously not provide all options or make assumptions about what options a given patient may prefer based on their ethnicity. However, in some cases, cautious use of AI may be helpful as one component of an assessment at end of life, possibly to reduce the effect of bias. Last year, Chinese researchers used AI to assess brain death. Remarkably, using an algorithm, the machine was better able to pick up on brain activity that had been missed by doctors using standard techniques. These findings bring to mind the case of Jahi McMath, the young girl who fell into a vegetative state after a complication during surgical removal of her tonsils. Implicit bias may have played a role not just in how she and her family were treated, but arguably in the conversations around whether she were alive or dead. But Topol cautions that using AI for the purposes of assessing brain activity should be validated before they are used outside of a research setting. We know that health providers can try to train themselves out of their implicit biases. The unconscious bias training that Stanford offers is one option, and something I’ve completed myself. Other institutions have included training that focuses on introspection or mindfulness. But it's an entirely different challenge to imagine scrubbing biases from algorithms and the datasets they're trained on. Given that the broader advisory council that Google just launched to oversee the ethics behind AI is now canceled, a better option would be allowing a more centralized regulatory body—such as building upon the proposal put forth by the FDA—that could serve universities, the tech industry, and hospitals. Artificial intelligence is a promising tool that has shown its utility for diagnostic purposes, but predicting death, and possibly even determining death, is a unique and challenging area that could be fraught with the same biases that affect analog physician-patient interactions. And one day, whether we are prepared or not, we will be faced by the practical and philosophical conundrum by having a machine involved in determining human death. Let’s ensure that this technology doesn’t inherit our biases. WIRED Opinion publishes pieces written by outside contributors and represents a wide range of viewpoints. Read more opinions here.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.
