To Democrats, the potentially giant step toward making the planet safer that Trump is taking in Vietnam pales in comparison to the opportunity to unsettle his presidency and possibly pave the way for his eventual impeachment. Michael Cohen is heading to prison after pleading guilty to lying to the IRS, financial institutions and Congress. But now he wants us to believe his accusations against President Trump are the truth. A bill requiring criminal background checks of gun buyers won't deny criminals access to firearms. . Are you not entertained? By calling on convicted liar and tax evader Michael Cohen to spend all day Wednesday telling more lies about President Trump at a hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Democrats hit a disgraceful new low in their taxpayer-funded partisan attacks on the president. Michael Cohen is a fake witness who is a confessed liar. His accusations against President Trump can't be believed. Ivanka Trump understands something her critics don’t; people need both to be and to feel useful, to contribute to the world around them and to know their contribution has actual worth. Michael Cohen has testified before Congress. America has now seen the very worst of what an attorney can be. His wanton breach of ethics has harmed not only the profession but, more importantly, the Americans it is meant to serve. When will we realize that the threat of religious persecution isn’t as “far away from home” as we may think? We need to take a stand and be vocal proponents of our rights, starting today. In any normal world, anything Cohen says would be immediately discarded because he is a pathological liar. But in Washington, D.C., the Democrats are giving him great credence because he will tell them what they want to hear. Pope Francis's closing address to the Vatican Summit on Child Protection was a disgraceful display of excuses and evasions. To Democrats, the potentially giant step toward making the planet safer that Trump is taking in Vietnam pales in comparison to the opportunity to unsettle his presidency and possibly pave the way for his eventual impeachment. The left, blinded by their dogmatic attachment to abortion, can't see that Americans don't want what they're selling. Latest opinion cartoons from FoxNews.com To the left, hating Trump is more important than rooting for his success with North Korea. If you want to know what the left is actually doing, listen to the way they attack other people. A Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate is facing an onslaught of attacks from radical leftist groups who contend his religious beliefs should disqualify him from serving as a judge. Kim Jong Un is a dictator shrouded in mystery, but the CIA helps President Trump learn more about Kim and North Korea.
