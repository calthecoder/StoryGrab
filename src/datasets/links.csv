---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/workers-detained-massive-tennessee-raid-sue-ice-officers-n974116---split---April 5 of last year began like any other day for Martha Pulido. But after arriving at her job in a meatpacking plant near Morristown in East Tennessee, she suddenly heard officers yelling at workers to put up their hands, she said. “From one moment to the next, the plant turned to chaos,” Pulido said in Spanish. Immigration officers yelled and dashed throughout the plant, she said. She could hear helicopters. At the time, it was the largest work-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in nearly a decade, with nearly 100 workers taken into custody on suspicion of being in the country illegally. On Thursday, two advocacy groups and a law firm filed a lawsuit against immigration officers, accusing them of unlawful searches and arrests, racial profiling and excessive force. "When a raid of this scale happens in our communities, it's like a bomb goes off," Stephanie Teatro, executive co-director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said during a news teleconference Thursday announcing the lawsuit. Attorneys said it was the first lawsuit against a large-scale work-site raid conducted by the Trump administration. In the aftermath of the raid, hundreds of people gathered at a church, desperately trying to find their family members, and nearly 600 children from the district missed school. "As the tragedy and chaos unfolded on that day, it was a painful reminder of why the government had stopped using this egregious enforcement tactic almost a decade before," Teatro said. Pulido said one of her co-workers slipped and fell, and immigration officers “drew their guns at her.” She said she saw one officer hit an employee in the face and another push a colleague. “Why the excessive use of arms and violence? The only thing we were doing was making a living to support our families,” she said. The suit was filed in federal court in Knoxville by the National Immigration Law Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the law firm of Sherrard, Roe, Voigt and Harbison on behalf of seven named workers and about 100 unnamed ones who were detained during the raid. The suit, which names nine federal officials and includes 30 unnamed ICE agents, claims the workers' rights were violated and seeks monetary and punitive damages. Meredith Stewart, a senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said what happened during the raid was illegal. “ICE agents stormed the meatpacking plant looking for Latino workers without knowing their identities or immigration status,” she said. “They detained those workers solely on the basis of their race, using intrusive, militaristic and even violent measures. This is law enforcement overreach, plain and simple.” Melissa Keaney, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, said ICE officers were at the meatpacking plant, Southeastern Provision in Bean Station, that day with a search warrant for financial documents for alleged crimes by the plant’s owner. “But clearly, their purpose that day and intent was far broader than what the warrant itself authorized,” Keaney said. An ICE spokesperson told NBC News it does not comment on pending litigation, but that, in general, "ICE activities are conducted in full compliance with federal law and agency policy." The spokesperson said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations division "equally focused" enforcement efforts on employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers as well as those employees. "The Southeastern Provision case was always a federal criminal investigation that also resulted in administrative immigration arrests," the spokesperson said. "To describe the operation as an immigration enforcement action is inaccurate; it was a federal criminal investigation that also resulted in immigration arrests." At the time of the raid, ICE said that of the 97 people detained, 86 were arrested on administrative charges and placed in deportation proceedings, with 54 placed in detention centers and 32 being released. Since then, advocates said Thursday that 40 have been released on bond, five remain in federal custody, six have been deported and 12 agreed to voluntary departure, in which an immigrant agrees to leave the country rather than go through a formal deportation process. Attorneys on Thursday declined to discuss the immigration status of the plaintiffs at the time of the raid, saying they did not believe it was relevant to the claims in the lawsuit and alleging that ICE agents used race as a proxy for determining workers' suspected immigration status. The Tennessee raid was followed by a pattern of other large workplace raids — at least one, in Ohio, was larger — after the Trump administration's pledge to step up arrests at companies accused of employing immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States. The owner of the meatpacking plant, James Brantley, pleaded guilty in September to federal charges of tax fraud, wire fraud and hiring immigrants unauthorized to work in the country and is awaiting sentencing, according to ICE.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/san-juan-mayor-carmen-yul-n-cruz-co-chair-bernie-n974276---split---Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan, an adversary of President Donald Trump, has signed on to be one of four national co-chairs of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. Her commitment to Sanders, the Vermont independent who announced his presidential bid on Tuesday, comes as the Democratic field is growing and competition for high-profile supporters is intensifying. Cruz told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday that she has working relationships with several of the senators who are running or may run. But she has been working with Sanders since 2016, “looking for a path for Puerto Rico.” “A lot of the things he’s been fighting for all his life I’ve been fighting for all my life,” Cruz said. “Things like let’s not put wealth before health.” She also named Sanders' efforts on education, collective bargaining, the rights of people in the LGBTQ and transgender communities, and other issues. She said he has had a long commitment to being in the forefront of structural changes, even when they were not popular. “Right now the United States has a president in the White House who is not up to the job,” Cruz said. “He does not represent values of integrity and unity, values of inclusion.” With Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another Democratic presidential candidate, Sanders co-sponsored legislation to wipe out the island’s $73 billion debt that it still grapples with today. Sanders also introduced a $146 billion Puerto Rico recovery plan. Neither bill made it out of committee. Nonetheless, Cruz said in a statement that Sanders would offer “a new path toward the resolution of many of the issues facing Puerto Rico,” including a “new relationship" with the United States. “In our darkest hour, he was there for us, not because it was politically convenient but because it was the right thing to do,” Cruz stated. Cruz vaulted to national attention when she criticized the Trump administration's slow response to the 2017 hurricane. Puerto Ricans on the island cannot vote in the general election, despite being U.S. citizens, but are able to vote in the primaries. Island residents who move to the mainland can vote in primaries and general elections once they register to vote in their state. “This is personal. The president came and threw paper towels at us," Cruz said. "He continues to disregard the pain of people from Puerto Rico." Sanders' support from Cruz, a high-profile Latina, could help him with minority communities. Sanders struggled in his 2016 campaign to win black voters. Latinos divided generationally in the 2016 primary, with younger Latinos backing Sanders. Along with Cruz, Sanders also named Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner; U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen as national co-chairs. Cruz said not to expect to see her talking only to Latino groups and Turner only to African-Americans. There won’t be any “walls that keep us in our corner because that will be ineffective,” she said. Cruz said she had conversations with other campaigns. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro made Puerto Rico his first stop after announcing his presidential bid. Cruz walked him through a neighborhood, La Playita, still recovering from the hurricane and showed him initiatives taken to help residents prepare for the next storm. “I think he, Julián, went into this for the right reasons,” Cruz said. “But again, I have a long-standing relationship with the senator and Bernie has a long-standing relationship with causes that touch the Latino community.” FOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM Suzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC Latino and NBCNews.com © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

I’m going to be the secretary of State as long as President Trump gives me the opportunity to serve as America’s senior diplomat,” Pompeo told NBC’s “Today Show” when asked about a possible race for the seat being vacated by the retirement of Sen. Pat Roberts. “I love doing what I’m doing, and I have 75,000 great warriors out and around the world trying to deliver for the American people,” he said. Pompeo was then asked to make clear that his answer meant he was ruling out the Senate campaign. “It’s ruled out,” Pompeo said. “I’m here. I’m loving it.” Senior Senate Republicans had made no secret in their interest in a Pompeo Senate run, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “At some point, [Pompeo] might decide he wants a different job and I wanted him to know we’d all be behind him if he did,” McConnell said in a Fox News interview on Feb. 5. Days before that, Trump had seemed to effectively rule out a Senate bid by the top diplomat, who is also a former GOP House member from Kansas.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/government-workers-transparency---split---Michael Horowitz, inspector general of the Justice Department, testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee in the Hart Building in 2017. Government institutions such as inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office toil in obscurity but their work is critical for America, John Donnelly writes. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) OPINION — Whistle-blowers and internal documents are the lifeblood of journalism. Without such sources, the full story of what’s happening in our country can’t come out. But there’s another, less heralded category of information that feeds journalism: the government institutions that provide Americans with non-partisan, objective data — places like the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office and the inspectors general. These organizations only exist because some lawmakers and staff long ago had the foresight to create them. Those bygone lawmakers knew something important: America needs institutions charged with regularly unearthing information that agencies would otherwise withhold, and that data needs to be put in front of the public, free of partisan spin. These researchers, auditors and investigators toil away in obscurity — but their work is critical. Especially today, as the media becomes increasingly ideological and balkanized, Americans need to have people they can turn to for as objective a version of reality as possible. America’s auditors are, of course, as fallible as any humans. But more than most, they get it right and play it straight. We need that now more than ever. Not only Congress but also the press needs this country’s auditors to set the record straight. Auditors can command attention and demand answers at federal agencies and other organizations in a way that many reporters, especially from smaller news organizations, cannot. Sometimes the resulting audit report is a story in itself. Other times, such a report can provide a journalist with crucial background facts to compare to what politicians say. Or the audit may suggest a line of inquiry to a reporter. The auditors themselves sometimes are available to explain an arcane subject to a reporter. These experts’ names usually do not get in the paper. But they help the press translate increasingly complex issues into plain, concise English for audiences who have less and less time to consume news. Lawmakers of yore not only created audit and investigative bodies but they also demanded in law that particular types of information be made public. Some of that information concerns the U.S. military. It is the law that the Pentagon must regularly send lawmakers certain unclassified summaries of key data — about the cost and efficacy of weapons, for example. It is safe to say that, absent such statutes, such information would be withheld from public view. Such reports gave the press and the Congress early clues about the ballooning costs and shrinking capabilities of weapons such as the Navy’s Zumwalt destroyers, the F-35 fighter jet and the Army’s now-defunct Future Combat Systems. Whether Congress does anything with the information is a separate and serious question. Defense secretaries routinely complain about such reporting requirements, and many of the dictates are unnecessary. But in many cases these reports provide the only way the public can really learn about how well approximately half of its annual discretionary appropriations are spent —and about how the wars waged in the public’s name are conducted. President Donald Trump said last month that it is “insane” that the Pentagon’s unclassified inspector general reports about U.S. wars are made public. Such reports have told us how, despite scores of billions of dollars of investment in Afghanistan over roughly 17 years, the Afghan security forces are still lacking, the narcotics trade still flourishes and the Taliban still controls nearly half the country. The president may not want that information made public. But that’s the law. He can try to change the law — but unless he does, he is bound by it. That’s because the people’s representatives, some of whom are no longer with us, decided the public has a right to see them. The president’s comments about the inspector general reports are part of a larger campaign. Its goal is to limit the public’s access to its government’s information and to discredit credible sources like Washington’s auditors. Martin Baron, the Washington Post’s executive editor, called this a campaign to “disqualify independent arbiters of fact [and] obliterate the very idea of objective truth” in a speech last fall. It’s an effort to sow distrust not just in journalists but in all the non-partisan sources of facts — from law enforcement to intelligence agencies to scientists. And why? So that people will believe only the politicians. This is not a tactic Trump created, but he and his allies are taking it to a new level. To say so is not to make a partisan statement. Press freedom is something every American should embrace, if only out of a selfish desire to not be fooled by people who do not have citizens’ interests in mind. Transparency, too, is something all Americans should value, regardless of their party affiliation. That’s why it is important to sustain and nurture the organizations in Washington that do their level best to give Americans the facts they need to govern themselves effectively. Earlier this month, the National Press Foundation presented John M. Donnelly, a CQ Roll Call senior writer, with its 2018 Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for Distinguished Reporting of Congress. Donnelly’s stories elucidated excesses in Pentagon programs and laxity in congressional oversight. One story documented lawmakers’ exaggerations about rates of military accidents and about the degree to which a higher defense budget could fix the problem. Another revealed how members of Congress had circumvented the earmarks ban by bankrolling a Pentagon fund to do it for them, with $2 billion-plus appropriated for programs the military had not sought. And a third story told the full story of how the Navy has spent $24 billion and counting over 13 years on just three still-unfinished destroyers and how the ships’ primary mission is still not defined.

Schwartz Soldiers stand at the entrance of the Tienditas International bridge that connects Venezuela with Colombia. Rodrigo Abd/AP hide caption Soldiers stand at the entrance of the Tienditas International bridge that connects Venezuela with Colombia. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is facing international pressure to step down after elections widely seen as rigged, ordered the country's vast border with Brazil to be closed. The move will make it harder for aid groups to get emergency food and medicine into the country. The U.S. and some other countries have recognized Juan Guaidó, the parliamentary opposition leader, as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Guaidó is embracing the support, and has promised to bring in emergency aid to help the poor country. However, Maduro and his allies view the aid — particularly that coming from the U.S. — as part of an attempt to destabilize his government, ushering in regime change. Maduro has told Venezuelans that he believes the humanitarian effort is actually a pretext for a U.S. invasion. "Maduro has remained firm, saying that this aid at the border will not come in," NPR's Eyder Peralta, reporting from Venezuela, told All Things Considered. "He views it as a foreign invasion, and he has asked his military to act accordingly." Earlier this month, Maduro blocked one of the busiest highways on the Colombian border, preventing the entry of food and medicine there. Maduro said Thursday he might also shut the border with Colombia, according to The Associated Press. A looming showdown may come to a head on Saturday. That's when Guaidó has declared that tons of international aid, currently warehoused along the border, must be brought into the country — either peacefully, or by force. So far the country's military has stood by Maduro, but President Trump has warned Venezuelan troops against trying to stop the flow of aid. "If you choose this path you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything," Trump said in Miami this week, directly addressing the Venezuelan military. To the crowd, he said, "End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death for your people." Thousands of volunteers have amassed at the border to help bring the food and medicine into the country. Opposition politicians left the country's capital Thursday to drive to the border, but they were blocked by security officials. Peralta, who was traveling with the politicians, says that thousands of cars were blocked on one of the most important highways in Venezuela. After Maduro announced the Brazilian border would be closed indefinitely, Venezuelans rushed into Brazil to buy groceries, Brazilian media reported. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

The fires referred to in Napa and Sonoma counties took place in 2017. In addition, at one point, we said the Camp Fire occurred last month. It burned in November 2018. And we previously said that California was one of only two states with a law known as "inverse condemnation." The state is one of only a few that have applied this legal doctrine of inverse condemnation liability to utilities. An earlier version of this story stated that photosynthesis in corn and sugar cane is more productive because it doesn't rely on the protein Rubisco. In fact, these and other "C4" plants also use Rubisco, but have evolved ways to work around its limitations. In the audio that is uploaded to this page, we incorrectly say the photo taken on the far side of the moon is the first ever to show it. It is actually the first such photo taken from the surface. Others have been taken from space. A previous version of this story and a photo caption said these are the first photos ever seen of the moon's normally hidden far side. Previous photos have been taken from space. These are the first images captured from the surface. In addition, Purdue University planetary scientist Briony Horgan's name was misspelled as Briorny. A previous version of this story and a summary on the homepage incorrectly said Apple was the first company worth $1 trillion. It is the first private sector company worth $1 trillion. In this report, we incorrectly say that the U.S. pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership "earlier this year." The correct year is 2017, not 2018. In this report, we state that Billy Childs "got a cold dose of how the classical establishment feels about composers of color when he went to the University of California." Childs said during an interview with NPR that he became "aware of race in music" when he studied composition at USC. But since this story aired, he has clarified that he encountered racism in the music world after graduating from the school, not while he was a student there. In the audio, as in a previous Web version of the story, we incorrectly call a procedure banned in Ohio a dilation and extraction. It is a dilation and evacuation. In the audio, as in a previous Web version of this story, we incorrectly say that the U.S. pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2018. The correct year is 2017. Also, the Web version has been updated to say that India imposed a global tariff on pulse crops and other farm products in late 2017. A previous version of this story misspelled Chinese President Xi Jinping's name as Jingping. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly identified Fatima Goss Graves as the co-founder of the Time's Up campaign. She is the co-founder of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. An earlier version of this story inaccurately described Ultima Thule as a planet in the story and headline. It is not a planet but a "minor planet," and is one of the small objects that make up the Kuiper belt, a ring of icy objects at the outskirts of our solar system.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends January 30, 2019 By Anthony Cilluffo and Richard Fry The 2020 U.S. presidential election is rapidly coming into view – and so is the electorate that will determine its outcome. While demographic changes unfold slowly, it’s already clear that the 2020 electorate will be unique in several ways. Nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters – their largest share ever – driven by long-term increases among certain groups, especially Hispanics. At the same time, one-in-ten eligible voters will be members of Generation Z, the Americans who will be between the ages 18 and 23 next year. That will occur as Millennials and all other older generations account for a smaller share of eligible voters than they did in 2016.  Pew Research Center defines the electorate as all citizens ages 18 and older living in the United States. We don’t account for those who have lost their voting rights, such as people convicted of felonies living in certain states, or those who can vote from outside the U.S., such as citizens living abroad and members of the armed forces stationed in other countries.  What might these demographic shifts mean politically? In 2016, nonwhite voters were more likely to back Democrat Hillary Clinton, while white voters were more likely to back Republican Donald Trump. Younger generations, meanwhile, differ notably from older generations in their views on key social and political issues. It remains unclear how these patterns might factor into the 2020 election and, as always, a great deal will depend on who turns out to vote. We project that the 2020 election will mark the first time that Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13% of eligible voters – slightly more than blacks. This change reflects the gradual but continuous growth in the Hispanic share of eligible voters, up from 9% in the 2008 presidential election and 7% in the 2000 election. The black eligible voter population has grown about as fast as the electorate overall, meaning their share has held constant at about 12% since 2000. In raw numbers, a projected 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, compared with 30 million blacks. The population of Asians eligible to vote will reach an estimated 11 million in 2020, which is more than double the 5 million who were eligible to vote in 2000, accounting for 5% of next year’s electorate. Taken together, this strong growth among minority populations means that a third of eligible voters will be nonwhite in 2020, up from about a quarter in 2000. This increase is at least partially linked to immigration and naturalization patterns: One-in-ten eligible voters in the 2020 election will have been born outside the U.S., the highest share since at least 1970. Voter turnout will play an important role in determining the relative electoral influence of different racial and ethnic groups. For example, while Hispanics will outnumber blacks among eligible voters next year, they may not actually cast more ballots than blacks due to different turnout patterns. In recent presidential elections, blacks were substantially more likely than Hispanics to vote. Indeed, the number of Hispanic eligible voters who didn’t vote has exceeded the number of those who did vote in every presidential election since 1996.  Still, the changing racial and ethnic composition of the electorate likely has political implications in part because nonwhites have long been significantly more likely than whites to back Democratic candidates. For instance, in the 2016 election, white voters favored Donald Trump by a 15 percentage point margin, while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton. Another important long-term trend is the overall aging of the electorate. In 2020, nearly a quarter of the electorate (23%) will be ages 65 and older, the highest such share since at least 1970. This reflects not only the maturation of the large Baby Boom generation but also increased life expectancy among older Americans. Baby Boomers and older generations, who will be ages 56 and older next year, are expected to account for fewer than four-in-ten eligible voters in 2020. This is a significant change from 2000, when nearly seven-in-ten eligible voters (68%) were Boomers, Silents or members of the Greatest Generation (collectively, those ages 36 and older at the time). Even as recently as 2012, when the youngest Boomer was 48 years old, Boomer and older generations were about half of the electorate (49%). The next presidential election will also mark the first time that Millennials (who will be ages 24 to 39 in 2020) will account for a slightly smaller share of the electorate than they represented in the last presidential election. The raw number of Millennials eligible to vote is increasing due to foreign-born Millennials naturalizing to become citizens. But the Millennial share of the electorate has peaked as they are not growing as fast as the electorate overall. Meanwhile, the leading edge of Generation Z (people ages 18 to 23 in 2020) is projected to comprise one-in-ten eligible voters, up from just 4% in 2016, when the vast majority were too young to cast ballots. These post-Millennials are on track to be more racially and ethnically diverse than their predecessors: In 2020, Gen Z eligible voters are expected to be 55% white and 45% nonwhite, including 21% Hispanic, 14% black, and 4% Asian or Pacific Islander. By comparison, the Boomer and older electorate is projected to be about three-quarters white (74%).  Differences in turnout rates again matter when talking about generations and should be kept in mind as election season gets underway. Since older adults are more likely to turn out to vote, it’s possible that older generations will form a larger share of actual voters in 2020 than their share in the electorate. That’s what happened in 2016: Even though Boomers and older generations accounted for 43% of eligible voters, they cast 49% of the ballots.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/19/latinos-have-become-less-likely-to-say-there-are-too-many-immigrants-in-u-s/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Luis Noe-Bustamante and Ana Gonzalez-Barrera The share of Latinos who say there are too many immigrants living in the United States has declined sharply over the past decade and a half, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of Hispanic adults. This finding comes as the foreign-born share of the U.S. population approaches a record high and as the issue of immigration is a top policy priority for many Americans. A quarter of Latinos in the U.S. say there are too many immigrants living in the country, while about half (48%) say there are the right amount and 14% say there are too few, according to the survey, conducted between July and September 2018. These numbers represent a dramatic shift from 2002 – the first time the Center asked this question – when 49% of Latinos said there were too many immigrants in the country, 37% said there were the right amount and 8% said there were too few. Latino connections to the immigrant experience are strong. Just under half of Latino adults are foreign born and another 31% are the U.S.-born children of immigrant parents, according to a Center analysis of the Current Population Survey. Today, immigrants from Latin America make up more than half of the roughly 45 million immigrants living in the country, including the majority of unauthorized immigrants.  As Latino attitudes toward the number of immigrants living in the U.S. have changed, an age gap in these views has emerged. In the 2018 survey, Latinos ages 18 to 29 were 13 percentage points less likely than those 30 and older to say there are too many immigrants in the U.S. In 2002, by comparison, there was virtually no age gap. Hispanics are the youngest major racial or ethnic group in the country: In 2017, they had a median age of 29, compared with a median age of 38 among all Americans. That same year, 29% of Hispanic adults were ages 18 to 29, compared with 21% among all Americans. The recent survey of Latinos found additional age gaps on other questions related to immigration. On how much attention they pay to immigration issues, for example, young Latinos (79%) were more likely than older Latinos (68%) to say they have talked about immigration policy debate with family, friends or coworkers since Donald Trump became president. Young Latinos (23%) were also more likely than their older Latino counterparts (14%) to say they have participated in a protest or demonstration to support immigrant rights since the start of the Trump administration. Age gaps in views of immigrants are not unique to Latinos. The same general pattern is evident among the general public, as other recent Pew Research Center surveys have shown. For example, in a January 2019 survey, 76% of U.S. adults ages 18 to 29 said immigrants today strengthen the country through their hard work and talents, compared with 59% of those 30 and older.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-bride-hoda-muthana-says-she-ll-have-no-problem-n974391---split---AL-HOUL CAMP, Syria — An American-born ISIS bride told NBC News Friday that she anticipates "no problem" in returning to the U.S. despite the Trump administration insisting that won't be allowed. Hoda Muthana, 24, left the U.S. to join the Islamic State in Syria in 2014. She is now staying in a refugee camp with her 18-month-old son after fleeing the remnants of the caliphate. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to refuse her entry. Pompeo told NBC's "Today" on Thursday that Muthana is not a citizen and will not be admitted to the country. The Alabama woman and her family are now suing the Trump administration in an effort to allow her to return. "I know in fact that I was a citizen," she told NBC News. "When I tried filing for a passport it was very easy. It came in 10 days. So, I thought I didn’t have a problem, and I’m sure there is no problem and I know my lawyer hopefully is working on it and he will win the case.” When asked what she expects will happen if she is allowed to return to the U.S., Muthana replied: "Of course I’ll be given jail time." Muthana is the daughter of a former Yemeni diplomat. The family's lawyers claim that the government determined she is not a citizen because her father held diplomatic status at the time of her birth in Hackensack, New Jersey. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a person born in the U.S. to an accredited foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to U.S. law and is not automatically considered an American citizen at birth. The Obama administration was first to determine she was not a citizen and notified her family they would revoke her passport in January 2016. The family's lawyers are now arguing that Muthana's father was no longer a diplomat when she was born and that she held a legitimate U.S. passport at the time she left for Syria. Muthana spoke to NBC News inside her tent in a section of the al-Houl Camp in northeast Syria reserved for foreign ISIS families. There were no officials from the camp present during the interview. The site was crowded with nearly 1,600 people — all women and children — from 48 countries, according to statistics provided by the camp’s director. Muthana said she fears for her life, not from camp guards, but from other ISIS wives who might take reprisals against her for speaking out against the group. Muthana described herself as a former Islamic “radical” who has changed her beliefs. She added that she deeply regrets travelling to ISIS territory and said she was “brainwashed” online.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/okinawa-vote-u-s-military-base-tests-security-ties-japan-n972976---split---TOKYO — Voters are expected to vent their anger this weekend at the heavy concentration of American military bases in Okinawa. The strategically important chain of islands southwest of the rest of Japan was the battleground for some of the fiercest fighting during World War II. It also served as a staging area for United States forces during the Vietnam War. But Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the dedicated U.S.-only bases in Japan despite accounting for less than 1 percent of the country’s land area. In the last two decades, frustration with the U.S. presence in Okinawa has been building over aircraft accidents, safety concerns, noise pollution, and several high-profile criminal cases involving U.S. military personnel and civilian staff. The two countries reached an agreement to reduce the impact of the U.S. bases after local outrage over the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 1995. Hiroji Yamashiro, who is head of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center and has led protests against the U.S. bases, said Sunday's vote is a "chance to show residents' overwhelming and unwavering opposition" to the heavy American presence there. The regional government's referendum is over a contentious plan to relocate a U.S. Marine Corps base 25 miles northeast to a coastal area in Henoko that is next to Camp Schwab, another American facility. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma is currently located in a crowded residential area in Ginowan, a city that is home to almost 100,000 people, on Okinawa’s main island. There was a major scare in December 2017 when a window from an American CH-53E transport helicopter fell onto the grounds of an elementary school near where dozens of students were playing. The school later disclosed that it had ordered students to take shelter 693 times in the year following that incident due to fears about approaching military aircraft. Residents of Okinawa, which is located close to Taiwan and faces the East China Sea, say their concerns have been ignored for too long and view the looming vote as a chance to make their views crystal clear. Almost 1.2 million voters are eligible to participate in the referendum, which specifically asks about the work associated with the relocation. While the result of the vote is not legally binding, strong opposition to the plan would be seen as a challenge to longstanding U.S. and Japanese government policy, and a proxy for broader dissatisfaction with the bases. “Okinawan residents have long campaigned for the removal, reorganization and downsizing of military bases,” said Hiroyuki Teruya, a professor of political science at Okinawa International University. “However, the Japanese government has prioritized the stability of the security treaty and ignored this issue.” In a poll conducted by Japan's Kyodo News on Feb. 16-17, more than two-thirds of the respondents said they would vote against the base plan. Just one in six planned to vote in favor, according to the poll of 1,047 eligible voters. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have described the alliance between their countries as “the cornerstone of peace, prosperity and freedom in the Asia-Pacific region.” At their first White House meeting after Trump’s election, the pair agreed on the need for the “long-term, sustainable presence of U.S. forces” in Japan. Trump and Abe have said both governments are committed to the relocation plan. But the new location at Henoko requires landfill work in Oura Bay, prompting opponents to raise environmental concerns. “By embarking on the reclamation at Henoko, the Abe administration has shown their refusal to listen to the Okinawan public,” said Masaaki Gabe, a professor of international politics and U.S.-Japan relations at Okinawa's University of the Ryukyus. Gabe cited last year's election win by a gubernatorial candidate who vowed to fight the base transfer over an Abe-government backed rival as suggesting that a majority of people in the region “opposed the new base construction through land reclamation of the natural and beautiful ocean.” Many anti-base campaigners are also demanding a faster reduction in the overall U.S. military footprint in Okinawa and see blocking the relocation as part of that effort. U.S. Forces Japan comprises some 54,000 military personnel, about half of whom are stationed in Okinawa. Yoshihide Suga, the Japanese government’s chief Cabinet secretary, said the existing location of the Futenma air station is dangerous as it is close to homes and schools. “We need to remove this danger and return this space to Okinawa prefecture,” he said at a press conference in Tokyo on Feb. 14. Suga said the central government would continue to seek the understanding of residents about the need to proceed with the relocation. However, when asked whether the government would stick to its plan regardless of the referendum’s results, Suga confirmed: “Yes, that’s the basic stance.” Leading the battle against the base relocation is Denny Tamaki, the governor of Okinawa, who won a large victory at the ballot box in September. Tamaki, the son of a former U.S. Marine and an Okinawan mother, has said he supports the U.S. alliance, but believes it is abnormal that his region has so many bases when it accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japanese territory. The governor, who traveled to New York and Washington, D.C., to press his case late last year, argues the impact of military accidents and other incidents spreads beyond the direct victims. “This anger and sadness is something which all Okinawan people hold inside themselves as well, and many people in Okinawa also struggle with not knowing where to direct this anger and sadness,” Tamaki said during a press conference in Tokyo on Nov. 9. A referendum in Okinawa Prefecture in 1996 showed 89 percent of participants supported a cut in U.S. military facilities. After that vote, which had a 59 percent turnout, the U.S. pledged to reduce the impact of its presence. One of the biggest transfers of land occurred in late 2016, when the U.S. handed back to the Japanese government almost 10,000 acres of land from the Northern Training Area. “After several recent land returns, less than 64 percent of U.S. exclusive-use areas are on Okinawa, while about 36 percent are on mainland,” U.S. Forces Japan said in a statement. Yamashiro, of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center, said the opposition effort had grown stronger and he hoped officials in Tokyo and Washington listened to the will of the people. “As soon as the referendum results are shown, both governments should go back to the drawing board on the new base construction at Henoko, and call into question how U.S. military bases should be in Okinawa,” he said.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-leave-about-200-troops-syria-white-house-says-n974356---split---About 200 U.S. troops will remain in Syria after the withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from the country, the White House said Thursday. President Donald Trump declared in December that "we have won against ISIS" and that he would pull all of the 2,000 or so U.S. troops from the country, an announcement that surprised U.S. allies and senior military officials and plunged the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS into turmoil. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that "a small peacekeeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for a period of time," confirming a report last month by NBC News that some U.S. forces wouldn't be part of the withdrawal. NBC News quoted U.S. officials at the time as saying the United States hadn't figured out yet what level of support it would continue to provide in the fight against ISIS and that it was likely to maintain some sort of air presence in northern Syria. The White House announcement came a day after The Washington Post quoted U.S. and foreign officials as saying the United States' European allies had rejected a request from the Trump administration to send their own troops to take up the slack from the U.S. withdrawal. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Armed Services Committee, welcomed the White House announcement on Thursday. "This will ensure ISIS does not return and Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew," Graham said. "This also ensures Turkey and SDF elements that helped us defeat ISIS will not go into conflict." "SDF" is short for Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S.-backed alliance of militias fighting to oust ISIS from the country. "With this decision, President Trump has decided to follow sound military advice," Graham said. "This decision will ensure that we will not repeat the mistakes of Iraq in Syria. For a small fraction of the forces we have had in Syria, we can accomplish our national security objectives." © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/roger-stone-back-court-after-instagram-post-n973986---split---A federal judge banned Roger Stone from speaking publicly about his case on Thursday, after hauling him back to court to answer for an Instagram post attacking her. "Publicity cannot subside if it's the defendant that's fanning the flames," U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Thursday, making it clear that a violation of the strict gag order would mean jail for the former Trump adviser. "Today, I gave you a second chance. This is not baseball, you don’t get a third chance," she told Stone. Stone can still raise funds for his legal defense and maintain his innocence publicly, but he cannot comment on the case or its participants, the judge said. Before issuing her ruling, Jackson said Stone "couldn't keep his story straight on the stand" when she allowed him the opportunity to explain his decision to post an image of her on Instagram with what appeared to be the crosshairs of a gun near her head. His apology, she said, rang "hollow." The Instagram post in question, posted to Stone's account earlier this week, was accompanied by a caption in which he suggested Jackson was politically biased, slammed Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and sought donations for his legal defense. Stone later said his post wasn't meant to be threatening and deleted it. "I am hurtfully sorry for my own stupidity. I am kicking myself, not as much as my wife is kicking me," Stone told the court Thursday. He called the Instagram post "a momentary lapse of judgment" before saying that the photo was selected by someone who works for him, which he estimated was about "five or six people." Stone also said he "didn't think they were crosshairs." Jackson, who is presiding over his prosecution, responded to Stone's Instagram post by scheduling the hearing to discuss "why the media contact order entered in this case and/or his conditions of release should not be modified or revoked in light of the posts on his Instagram account." Her options included revoking his bail. Stone's attorneys argued Thursday that Stone, who said he was broke and struggling to deal with the stress, did not violate the limited gag order or the conditions of his release. They assured Jackson that Stone would not repeat his mistake. "Sometimes a person learns a lesson, especially when a person is unrestrained in his speaking. It’s indefensible," Stone attorney Bruce Rogow said. "I agree with you there," the judge said. Government prosecutors sought a stricter gag order. "I would submit that the defendant's testimony at this hearing was not credible," prosecutor Jonathan Kravis said. "That he committed a lapse in judgement is belied by the fact that even after he realized the post was a mistake, he continued to make statements to the media that amplified that message." Stone, who was arrested by the FBI in January, faces seven charges arising from Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, including five counts of making false statements, one count of obstruction and one count of witness tampering. Stone has denied all charges. After Stone gave a slew of media interviews, Jackson issued a limited gag order in the case last week that prevents Stone from speaking to the press about the case in the vicinity of the courthouse. Neither the limited gag order, nor the threat of jail time, discouraged Stone from giving interviews or posting about his case. On his way to court Thursday morning, he was on Instagram again, posting a photo of him posing with merchandise he's selling in support of his legal defense. “Help me in my epic fight against the anti-@realdonaldTrump Deep State,” he wrote with the hashtag, #rogerstonedidnothingwrong.

Steve King told reporters in Iowa that he has “nothing to apologize for.” (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Rep. Steve King was defiant in an interview with Iowa public television this week, insisting he won’t apologize for the racist remarks and actions that cost him all of his committee assignments and endangered his reelection. “I have nothing to apologize for,” King told a roundtable of reporters on Iowa Public Television in a Thursday taping. While King disavowed white nationalism, he also argued that term has been “weaponized by the left” to mean racism, but did not provide his own definition of the term. King repeated his frequent defense of the phrase “Western Civilization.” King has often voiced the far-right theory that immigration and diversity will lead to a collapse of Western civilization. Advocacy groups dedicated to rooting out hate speech say “Western civilization” used in that context is a euphemism for whites. King also blamed the recent tumult on a conspiracy between the New York Times, the Washington Post and former National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Stivers. “We’ve seen what the news media has done. President Trump has labeled the New York Times a dishonest entity. I think that’s been well held up, not only the New York Times but a number of other places,” King said. “So if I look back through this, it all starts with a formerly credible organization that launches this and then we have this phenomenon that America is not ready for, this cyberbullying that unleashes a firestorm,” King continued. King has faced severe scrutiny since the 4th District Republican was quoted in the New York Times in January as having said, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” That followed an October story in the Washington Post that King met with a far-right party with ties to Nazis on a trip to Austria, and granted an interview to a party news outlet in which he bemoaned cultural and racial diversity. “The story is false, but that built something that then Steve Stivers capitalized on just a week before the election,” King said Thursday. Both papers have defended their reporting. King also sought to normalize his denigration of immigrants by spotlighting the similarities between his stance on the issue of immigration and that of President Donald Trump. “Donald Trump will be on the ballot. He and I are four-square on the same agenda here. I’m the guy that actually created the immigration policy that helped launch him into the presidency, and I support him on the wall and every other piece of his agenda,” King said. “The Toronto mayor has been described as white nationalist, well so has the president,” King said, referring to his endorsement of Faith Goldy. King also confirmed he will run for re-election Thursday despite the fact the embattled incumbent will face three primary challengers. In past cycles, King has easily secured re-election. But his 18-point lead over Democrat J.D. Scholten weeks before the election narrowed to a 3-point margin of victory amid new reports of racist statements and sympathies with white supremacists.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/why-politicians-and-everyone-need-to-think-about-legacy---split---Visitors at the National Memorial For Peace And Justice in Montgomery, Ala., on April 26, 2018. The memorial includes over 800 hanging steel columns, each representing a county where people were lynched. (Bob Miller/Getty Images) OPINION — At least the bill was approved on a voice vote. That was the bill that would make lynching a federal crime, passed in the Senate late last week — in 2019. Let that sink in. The legislation still must be approved by the Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to happen with no problem, and be signed into law by President Donald Trump. But it would be unwise to take anything for granted since similar legislation has stalled for more than 100 years, held up by elected public servants who felt that taking a stand would be too politically risky. Certainly, many of those 19th- and 20th- century leaders believed that extrajudicial punishment was the right of the majority, a right to use the rope or the torch or the bullet to exact retribution on those they considered inferior and to use that power to show what could happen to those who did not “know their place.” More recently, this week in fact, an Alabama newspaper publisher wrote a column longing for a return to the days of Ku Klux Klan-style “justice” for his enemies, which include “Democrats in the Republican Party.” But whether or not it was (and is) a sincere belief of those who stood in the pro-lynching camp, it definitely was a calculated one. Those politicians did not want to be punished at the ballot box by constituents who made up the mob or tacitly approved of its actions. They were followers, not leaders, thinking of the present — their present — and not their legacy, what the world would think of them after they left it. Today’s politicians would do well to pause — not so easy as each day brings a confounding rush of ever-escalating news events — to consider what their names would mean to children and grandchildren who carry it on, and what the world’s judgment would be of the policies they left behind. What are the headlines now? A president taking a stand and declaring a national emergency to fulfill a campaign promise to “build the wall,” while forgetting the part about Mexico paying for it. Will historians wonder why he made this unprecedented move while illegal immigration numbers were trending down and the drugs flooding the country were mostly coming through legal points of entry? Also watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge Will senators who are supporting him, such as South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, be willing to be known for following this president when they labeled far less drastic actions by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, an overreach of executive power? Will those on the fence, such as Maine Republican Susan Collins, translate dithering into a principled break with their party? Predicting what Trump’s use of emergency powers would lead to is impossible, but clues from the past and his record so far indicate the unpredictable could veer into uncharted, scary territory. This feels like one of those times when legacy is at stake. Who will be honored, vilified or forgotten? Three senators — Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats running for the presidency, and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina — joined in bipartisan co-authorship of the anti-lynching bill, with Scott saying the Senate “sent a strong signal that this nation will not stand for the hate and violence spread by those with evil in their hearts.” Before describing the crime and prescribing the punishment, the bill lays out a horrific list of some cold, hard historical facts in the “Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018”: “The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction. … Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968. Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials. Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (referred to in this section as the ‘NAACP’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti-Defamation League. “Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century. Between 1890 and 1952, seven Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching. Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed three strong anti-lynching measures. Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so.” It is not as though there have not always brave voices calling for justice. The journalist, suffragist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells, a heroine and role model of mine, was honored this month with a street bearing her name in Chicago, the city she called home. But in her time, in 1892, she barely escaped with her life after angry mobs raged at her denunciations of lynching in the Memphis Free Speech and destroyed the newspaper’s offices. It was expedient all those years for lawmakers to say “no,” staining their own legacies as they are remembered as obstacles to progress, horrid historical footnotes. Those who disapproved of lynching but decided to stand silently by are remembered for being too afraid of losing the votes of the racists and bigots. Generations that followed have asked how they ignored the terror in front of their eyes that gruesomely cut down fellow Americans for the sake of political survival. Recognized in the bill is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, opened in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, which “is the Nation’s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence.” Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, the nonprofit organization behind the memorial, has also made the connection between injustice then and now. It’s interesting that it took three African-Americans to introduce this bill last year, with others then signing on as co-sponsors. Would it have been more powerful if, instead of the anonymity of a unanimous voice vote last week, each senator had loudly taken a stand? You don’t have to be a senator or president or member of Congress to live a life and leave a legacy to be proud of. Yet the view from history and the here and now shows it’s not so easy to do.

Mnuchin to calm plunging financial markets backfired Monday, further rattling investors with new fears about whether major U.S. banks have enough cash on top of worries about interest rates, political instability in Washington and a slowing global economy. He’s a failed U.S. Senate candidate with an undistinguished congressional record who, for the moment, is a blazing-hot 2020 presidential prospect — despite the fact that he may not run and faces long odds if he does. Months after President Trump took office, Russia’s disinformation teams trained their sites on a new target: special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Having worked to help get Trump into the White House, they now worked to neutralize the biggest threat to his staying there. The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former FBI director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies. One post on Instagram — which emerged as an especially potent weapon in the Russian social media arsenal — claimed that Mueller had worked in the past with “radical Islamic groups.” Such tactics exemplified how Russian teams ranged nimbly across social media platforms in a shrewd online influence operation aimed squarely at American voters. The effort started earlier than commonly understood and lasted longer while relying on the strengths of different sites to manipulate distinct slices of the electorate, according to a pair of comprehensive new reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released Monday.

The former campaign adviser for President Trump has been forbidden to speak publicly about his case. Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption Roger Stone, accompanied by his wife, Nydia, arrives at federal court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. The former campaign adviser for President Trump has been forbidden to speak publicly about his case. Updated at 6:34 p.m. ET A federal judge on Thursday barred Roger Stone from talking publicly about his case after an inflammatory photo was posted on his Instagram account of the judge that included what appeared to be a crosshairs. Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected apologies offered by Stone, both in writing and in person at a hearing in Washington, D.C. If Stone violates the order, Jackson warned him, she would be "compelled to adjust your environment." She then spelled out what that meant — she would revoke his bond and order him to be detained ahead of his trial. The judge's decision adds Stone to an existing gag order that prohibits attorneys from speaking about the case and bars any of the parties from talking about it in the vicinity of the courthouse. Stone, 66, has been charged with obstruction, false statements and witness tampering as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The obstruction and false statements charges relate to testimony he gave to Congress about the role he allegedly played in 2016 as an intermediary between Donald Trump's campaign and WikiLeaks. Stone has pleaded not guilty and says he did nothing wrong. He and supporters also have leveled intense criticism at the government before and since his arrest, including of the FBI, the Justice Department and then Jackson herself. Stone's Instagram post on Monday suggested that conspirators within the "deep state" had schemed to put his case before an ostensibly unfair Jackson so she could preside over a "show trial." A shape like the crosshairs of a rifle scope appeared in the backdrop of the photo. The post was then deleted. Stone submitted a written apology, but Jackson ordered that he appear on Thursday to explain himself. In a surprise move, Stone took the stand himself to testify under oath at Thursday's hearing. He apologized again, and called the post a "stupid lapse in judgement." He said he was under an immense amount of pressure as well as emotional and financial stress. Jackson, however, was unmoved. She noted that after Stone's initial apology was filed with the court this week, he appeared on TV defending the photograph and calling the uproar an unfair media attack on him.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out in views on race, climate and the role of government By Kim Parker, Nikki Graf and Ruth Igielnik  No longer the new kids on the block, Millennials have moved firmly into their 20s and 30s, and a new generation is coming into focus. Generation Z – diverse and on track to be the most well-educated generation yet – is moving toward adulthood with a liberal set of attitudes and an openness to emerging social trends. On a range of issues, from Donald Trump’s presidency to the role of government to racial equality and climate change, the views of Gen Z – those ages 13 to 21 in 2018 – mirror those of Millennials.1 In each of these realms, the two younger generations hold views that differ significantly from those of their older counterparts. In most cases, members of the Silent Generation are at the opposite end, and Baby Boomers and Gen Xers fall in between.2 It’s too early to say with certainty how the views of this new generation will evolve. Most have yet to reach voting age, and their outlook could be altered considerably by changing national conditions, world events or technological innovations. Even so, two new Pew Research Center surveys, one of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 and one of adults ages 18 and older, provide some compelling clues about where they may be headed and how their views could impact the nation’s political landscape. Only about three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials (30% and 29%, respectively) approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president. This compares with 38% of Gen Xers, 43% of Boomers and 54% of Silents. Similarly, while majorities in Gen Z and the Millennial generation say government should do more to solve problems, rather than that government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals, Gen Xers and Boomers are more evenly divided on this issue. For their part, most Silents would like to see a less activist government. When it comes to views on race, the two younger generations are more likely than older generations to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the United States today. And they are much more likely than their elders to approve of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a sign of protest. The younger generations are also more accepting of some of the ways in which American society is changing. Majorities among Gen Z and the Millennial generation say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society, while older generations are less convinced of this. And they’re more likely to have a positive view of interracial and same-sex marriage than their older counterparts. As a recent Pew Research Center report highlighted, Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation we have seen, but this isn’t all that’s driving the attitudes of this generation when it comes to issues surrounding race and diversity. There are significant, if more modest, generational differences on these issues even among non-Hispanic whites. While Generation Z’s views resemble those of Millennials in many areas, Gen Zers are distinct from Millennials and older generations in at least two ways, both of which reflect the cultural context in which they are coming of age. Gen Zers are more likely than Millennials to say they know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns to refer to them: 35% say this is the case, compared with a quarter of Millennials. Among each older generation, the share saying this drops: 16% of Gen Xers, 12% of Boomers and just 7% of Silents say this. The youngest generation is also the most likely to say forms or online profiles that ask about a person’s gender should include options other than “man” or “woman.” Roughly six-in-ten Gen Zers (59%) hold this view, compared with half of Millennials and four-in-ten or fewer Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. These findings seem to speak more to exposure than to viewpoint, as roughly equal shares of Gen Zers and Millennials say society should be more accepting of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman. Members of Gen Z also stand out somewhat in their views on the role social media plays in modern news consumption. These teens and young adults are much less likely than older generations to say the fact that more people are getting their news from social media is a bad thing for society – 39% of Gen Zers hold this view, compared with about half among each of the older generations. While they are young and their political views may not be fully formed, there are signs that those in Generation Z who identify as Republican or lean to the Republican Party diverge somewhat from older Republicans – even Millennials – in their views on several key issues. These same generational divides are not as apparent among Democrats. On views about race relations, Gen Z Republicans are more likely than older generations of Republicans to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites. Among Republicans, 43% of Gen Zers say this, compared with 30% of Millennials and roughly 20% of Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Z Republicans are also much more likely than their GOP counterparts in older generations to say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society. On each of these measures, Democrats’ views are nearly uniform across generations. In addition, the youngest Republicans stand apart in their views on the role of government and the causes of climate change. Gen Z Republicans are much more likely than Republicans in older generations to say government should do more to solve problems. And they are less likely than their older counterparts to attribute the earth’s warming temperatures to natural patterns, as opposed to human activity. While younger and older Americans differ in many of their views, there are some areas where generation is not as clearly linked with attitudes. When it comes to the merits of having more women running for political office, majorities across generations say this is a good thing for the country. Majorities in each generation also say that, on balance, legal immigrants have had a positive impact on the U.S. This analysis is based on a survey of 920 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 conducted online Sept. 17-Nov. 25, 2018, combined with a nationally representative survey of 10,682 adults ages 18 and older conducted online Sept. 24-Oct. 7, 2018, using Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.3 Findings based on Generation Z combine data from the teens survey with data from the 18- to 21-year-old respondents in the adult survey. When it comes to views on political issues and the current political climate, younger generations have consistently held more liberal views than older generations in recent years. Today, members of Generation Z hold many similar views to Millennials, and both tend to be more liberal than older generations. Seven-in-ten Gen Zers say the government should do more to solve problems in this country, while just 29% say the government is doing too many things that are better left to individuals and businesses. Gen Zers are slightly more likely to favor government activism than Millennials, and significantly more likely than older generations: 53% of Gen Xers, 49% of Baby Boomers and 39% of Silents favor government involvement over businesses and individuals. Among Republicans and those who lean to the Republican Party, the generational divides are even starker. Roughly half (52%) of Gen Z Republicans say they think the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 38% of Millennial Republicans and 29% of Gen Xers. About a quarter of Republican Baby Boomers (23%) and fewer GOP Silents (12%) believe the government should be doing more. Among Democrats, however, these generational divides largely disappear. Roughly eight-in-ten Gen Z (81%) and Millennial Democrats (79%) say the government should do more to solve problems, as do about seven-in-ten Democratic Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Zers’ views about climate change are virtually identical to those of Millennials and not markedly different from Gen Xers. About half in all three generations say the earth is getting warmer due to human activity. Boomers are somewhat more skeptical of this than Gen Zers or Millennials. Members of the Silent Generation are least likely to say this (38%) and are more likely to say the earth is warming mainly due to natural patterns (28%) than are Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers. Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out from older generations as the least likely to say the earth is warming because of natural patterns – 18% say this. By comparison, 30% of Millennial, 36% of Gen X and roughly four-in-ten Boomer (42%) and Silent Generation Republicans (41%) say the same. Almost no generation gap exists among Democrats in views on this issue. When it comes to views of Donald Trump, there are sizable generational divides, particularly among Republicans. Nine-in-ten Republicans in the Silent Generation approve of the job the president is doing, as do 85% of Baby Boomer Republicans and 76% of Gen X Republicans; smaller majorities of GOP Millennials (65%) and Gen Zers (59%) think he’s doing a good job. Younger generations also have a different view of the U.S. relative to other countries in the world. While pluralities of nearly all generations (with the exception of the Silent Generation) say the U.S. is one of the best countries in the world along with some others, Gen Zers and Millennials are the least likely to say the U.S. is better than all other countries. Only 14% and 13%, respectively, hold this view, compared with one-in-five Gen Xers, 30% of Boomers and 45% of Silents. Roughly three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials say there are other countries that are better than the U.S. In their views about the general direction of the country, Gen Zers are mostly downbeat, but they’re not alone in that assessment. Among Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers, two-thirds or more say things in this country are generally going in the wrong direction. About six-in-ten Boomers (61%) say the same. Members of the Silent Generation have a less negative view (53% say things are going in the wrong direction). Today’s 13- to 21-year-olds are only slightly more likely than Millennials to say ordinary citizens can do a lot to influence the government in Washington (53% of Gen Zers say this vs. 46% of Millennials). And their views on this issue don’t differ much from those of Gen Xers, Boomers or Silents (50%, 58% and 58%, respectively, say citizens can have a lot of influence on the government). Younger generations have a different perspective than their older counterparts on the treatment of blacks in the United States. Two-thirds of Gen Z (66%) and 62% of Millennials say blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the U.S. Fewer Gen Xers (53%), Boomers (49%) and Silents (44%) say this. Roughly half of Silents (44%) say both races are treated about equally, compared with just 28% among Gen Z. The patterns are similar after controlling for race: Younger generations of white Americans are far more likely than whites in older generations to say blacks are not receiving fair treatment. Younger generations also have a different viewpoint on the issue of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a protest. Majorities among Gen Z (61%) and the Millennial generation (62%) approve of the protests. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (44%) and Baby Boomers (37%) favor these actions. Members of the Silent Generation disapprove of the protests by a more than two-to-one margin (68% disapprove, 29% approve). Gen Zers and Millennials share similar views about racial and ethnic change in the country. Roughly six-in-ten from each generation say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (52% say this is a good thing), and older generations are even less likely to view this positively. Younger Republicans again stand out in this regard. Half of Gen Z Republicans (51%) say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for the country. This compares with 38% of Millennial, 34% of Gen X, 30% of Boomer and 28% of Silent Generation Republicans. Among Democrats, there is widespread agreement across generations. Though they differ in their views over the changing racial and ethnic makeup of the country, across generations most Americans agree about the impact that legal immigrants have on society. On balance, all generations see legal immigration as more positive than negative. Across most generations, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say legal immigrants are having a positive impact. However, within Gen Z there is no partisan gap on this issue. When it comes to views about how careful people should be in using potentially offensive language, members of Gen Z are divided over whether people need to be more careful or if concerns about political correctness have gone too far. Some 46% of Gen Zers say people need to be more careful about the language they use to avoid offending people with different backgrounds, while 53% say too many people are easily offended these days over the language that others use. Gen Zers’ views are only modestly different from those of Millennials and Gen Xers on this topic: 39% and 38%, respectively, say people need to be more careful about the language they use, while about six-in-ten say people are too easily offended these days. Interestingly, members of the Silent Generation are closer to members of Gen Z in their views on this topic than they are to Boomers, Gen Xers or Millennials. Since they first entered adulthood, Millennials have been at the leading edge of changing views on same-sex marriage. In 2014, when a narrow majority of all adults (52%) said they favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, 67% of Millennials held that view. Today, members of Generation Z are just as likely as Millennials to say allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry has been a good thing for the country (48% of Gen Zers and 47% of Millennials hold this view). One-third of Gen Xers say this is a good thing for the country, as do 27% of Baby Boomers. Members of the Silent Generation are the least enthusiastic (18% say this is a good thing). Relatively few Gen Zers or Millennials (15%) say same-sex marriage is a bad thing for society. Boomers and Silents are much more likely to view this change negatively (32% and 43%, respectively, say this is a bad thing). Across generations, about four-in-ten say allowing gays and lesbians to marry hasn’t made much of a difference for the U.S. In other ways, too, Gen Zers and Millennials are similar in their openness to changes that are affecting the institutions of marriage and family. Roughly half (53%) from each generation say interracial marriage is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (41% say this is a good thing), and older generations are much less likely to view interracial marriage positively. Relatively few across generations say this trend is bad for society; majorities of Silents (66%) and Boomers (60%) say it doesn’t make much difference, as do 53% of Xers. When it comes to couples living together without being married, roughly two-thirds of each generation (with the exception of Silents) say this doesn’t make much of a difference for society. About one-in-five Gen Zers and Millennials say cohabitation is a good thing for society – higher than the shares for older generations. Fully 41% of Silents say this is bad thing for the country, as do about a quarter of Boomers. Compared with their views on cohabitation, the youngest generations have a more negative assessment of the impact of single women raising children: 35% among Gen Z and 36% of Millennials say this is a bad thing for society; roughly four-in-ten Gen Xers and Boomers and 48% of Silents say the same. About half of Gen Zers and Millennials say this doesn’t make much difference for society, while relatively few (15%) view it as a good thing. In their views about gender roles within couples, members of Generation Z are virtually identical to Millennials and Gen Xers and quite similar to Baby Boomers. Large majorities in all four groups say that, in households with a mother and a father, the responsibility for providing for the family financially should be shared equally. About one-in-five Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers – and a quarter of Boomers – say this responsibility should fall primarily on the fathers. Very few say mothers should be mostly responsible for this. Silents are the outliers on this issue: 40% say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for their families financially, while 58% say this responsibility should be shared between mothers and fathers. For the most part, there are no notable gender gaps in views on this issue; the Silent Generation is the exception. Among Gen Zers, Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers, male and female respondents are largely in agreement that mothers and fathers should share family financial responsibility. Among members of the Silent Generation, roughly half of men (49%) but 33% of women say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for the family financially. Large majorities (84% or more) across generations say that responsibility for taking care of children should be shared by mothers and fathers in households with two parents. Some 13% among Gen Z say this responsibility should fall mainly to mothers; similar shares of each of the other generations say the same. Very few say raising children should fall mostly to dads. Male and female respondents across generations have similar views on this issue. A majority of Americans, regardless of generation, view the increasing number of women running for public office as a positive change for our society. Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers say this is a good thing, as do 61% of Boomers and 55% of Silents. About four-in-ten in the Silent Generation (39%) say this trend doesn’t make much difference for society, somewhat higher than the share among the three youngest generations (roughly three-in-ten). There are significant gender gaps on this question, with female respondents expressing much more enthusiasm about the growing number of women running for office in each generation except the Silents. Among Gen Zers, 76% of young women, versus 57% of young men, say the fact that more women are running for office is a good thing for society. The pattern is similar for Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers. However, among Silents, roughly equal shares of men (57%) and women (54%) say this is a good thing. The recognition of people who don’t identify as a man or a woman has garnered increased attention amid changing laws concerning gender options on official documents and growing usage of gender-neutral pronouns. There are stark generational differences in views on these issues. Generation Z is the most likely of the five generations to say that when a form or online profile asks about a person’s gender it should include options other than “man” and “woman”; a 59% majority of Gen Zers say this. Half of Millennials say forms or online profiles should include additional gender options, as do about four-in-ten Gen Xers (40%) and Boomers (37%) and roughly a third of those in the Silent Generation (32%). These views vary widely along partisan lines, with generational differences evident within each party coalition, but sharpest among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. About four-in-ten Republican Gen Zers (41%) think forms should include other gender options, compared with 27% of Republican Millennials, 17% of GOP Gen Xers and Boomers and 16% of Republican Silents. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, half or more in all generations say this, including 71% of Gen Zers and 55% of Silents. When it comes to how accepting society in general is of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman, the views of Gen Zers and Millennials differ from those of older generations. Roughly half of Gen Zers (50%) and Millennials (47%) think that society is not accepting enough. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (39%), Boomers (36%) and those in the Silent Generation (32%) say the same. A plurality of the Silent Generation (41%) say society is too accepting of people who don’t identify as a man or woman. Across all generations, roughly a quarter say society’s acceptance level is about right. Again, there are large partisan gaps on this question, and Gen Z Republicans stand apart to some extent from other generations of Republicans in their views. Among Republicans, about three-in-ten Gen Zers (28%) say that society is not accepting enough of people who don’t identify as a man or woman, compared with 20% of Millennials, 15% of Gen Xers, 13% of Boomers and 11% of Silents. Democrats vary little by generation in shares holding this view. Gen Zers and Millennials are much more familiar than their elders with the idea that some people may prefer gender-neutral pronouns: 74% of Gen Zers and 69% of Millennials say they have heard “a lot” or “a little” about people preferring that others use gender-neutral pronouns such as “they” instead of “he” or “she” when referring to them, with about three-in-ten saying they have heard a lot about this. Most Gen Xers (62%) also have heard a lot or a little about people preferring gender-neutral pronouns. There is less awareness of this among older generations. Still, half of Boomers and 45% of Silents say they have heard at least a little about gender-neutral pronouns. Gen Zers are also the most likely among the five generations to say they personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns, with 35% saying so, compared with 25% of Millennials. Each of these younger generations is more likely than Gen Xers (16%), Boomers (12%) and Silents (7%) to say they personally know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns when referring to them. This generational pattern is evident among both Democrats and Republicans. In addition to their greater familiarity with gender-neutral pronouns, Gen Zers and Millennials express somewhat higher levels of comfort with using gender-neutral pronouns, though generational differences on this question are more modest. Majorities of Gen Zers (57%) and Millennials (59%) say they would feel “very” or “somewhat” comfortable using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so, including about three-in-ten (32% of Gen Zers, 31% of Millennials) who say they would be very comfortable doing this. By comparison, Gen Xers and Boomers are evenly divided: About as many say they would feel at least somewhat comfortable (49% and 50%, respectively) as say they would be uncomfortable. Silents are the only group in which more say they would feel uncomfortable (59%) than say they would feel comfortable (39%) using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone. There are wide party gaps on this measure across generations. Within each generation, Democrats come down on the side of feeling comfortable, rather than uncomfortable, using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so. In contrast, for each generation of Republicans, majorities say they would feel uncomfortable doing this. Across generations, knowing someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns is linked to comfort levels in using these pronouns. Three-quarters of Millennials and about two-thirds of Gen Zers, Gen Xers and Boomers who personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns say they would feel very or somewhat comfortable referring to someone with a gender-neutral pronoun. Those who don’t know someone are roughly 20 percentage points less likely to say the same (51% of Gen Zers, 54% of Millennials, 46% of Gen Xers and 48% of Boomers who don’t know someone say this).4 Fact Tank01/17/2019 Fact Tank11/28/2018 Fact Tank09/06/2018 Social Trends01/17/2019 U.S. Politics01/18/2019 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-419-4349 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anderson-cooper-roger-stone_n_5c6fcb92e4b00eed0832e672---split---CNN’s Anderson Cooper warned that longtime Trump associate Roger Stone is skating on thin ice after narrowly avoiding prison for Instagramming a photo showing crosshairs near the head of a federal judge. “It’s all fun and games until someone threatens a federal judge and almost gets sent to jail for it,” Cooper said during his Thursday night monologue. ″Today, a judge signaled as clearly as she could without actually imprisoning him that yes, playtime is over,” Cooper continued. “No more Nixonian gestures on the courthouse steps the way it was at his first court appearance ... No more talking about being the victim of a deep state conspiracy, as he’s been doing lately, and which the judge today took exception to.” Earlier in the day, Judge Amy Berman slapped Stone with a gag order, preventing him from speaking publicly about his case. Stone, a longtime ally of Donald Trump and self-proclaimed dirty trickster political operative, is charged in a seven-count indictment with lying to Congress, obstructing justice and witness tampering in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Whatever you think of all of this, things are getting very serious very quickly,” Cooper added, pointing to the walls closing in on other Trump associates, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, and the potential end of Mueller’s investigation. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who sat through Stone’s Thursday hearing, called it “wild.” “The whole thing made very little sense,” Toobin said of Stone’s attempts to explain away the crosshairs in the picture he posted as a Celtic symbol. “Certainly his lawyers are going to be hitting him with rubber hoses saying, ‘Stop doing this stupid stuff.’ But, you know, Roger is a free spirit and he loves attention and he is allowed ... to talk about politics, he’s allowed to talk about Trump ― he’s just not allowed to talk about his case.”
---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-say-trump-keeping-congress-dark-north-korea-n974301---split---WASHINGTON — Democratic lawmakers leading key House national security committees accused President Donald Trump Thursday of keeping Congress in the dark about his administration's talks with North Korea and the state of the regime's nuclear weapons program. "There is no legitimate reason for having failed to provide regular, senior-level briefings to the relevant committees of jurisdiction on a matter of such significance to our national security," Reps. Eliot Engel, Adam Smith and Adam Schiff, chairmen of the House foreign affairs, intelligence and armed services committees, wrote in a letter to the president. The lawmakers said "our ability to conduct oversight of U.S. policy toward North Korea on behalf of the American people has been inappropriately curtailed by your administration's unwillingness to share information with Congress." Trump plans to head to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi next week for a second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the Democratic lawmakers said Congress has yet to have been briefed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on what transpired at the last summit between the two heads of state in Singapore in June last year. Democrats in the Senate have been frustrated for some time over the frequency of briefings from the administration, a staffer told NBC News. But the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, disagreed. The senator "communicates with the State Department, the National Security Council, and the White House regularly on this issue, even as recently as this week," spokesperson Kaylin Minton said in an email. "So needless to say, he has a different view." The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. In their letter to the president, the Democrats cited recent comments from top intelligence officials and military leaders that North Korea was unlikely to completely abandon its nuclear weapons arsenal, saying it contradicted the president's portrayal of the negotiations. "We are perplexed and troubled by the growing disconnect between the Intelligence Community's assessment and your administration's statements about Kim Jong Un's actions, commitments, and intentions," the Democrats wrote. The lawmakers renewed a demand to provide members of Congress and staff access to information on North Korea's nuclear and conventional weapons program. The Democrats said Congress has been cut off from intelligence on those programs and that it had undercut lawmakers' ability to assess the threat posed by the regime. The Democratic chairs also said the administration has failed to abide by the defense authorization law that required the secretary of defense to deliver a report to Congress by October 2018 on North Korea's nuclear program, which was supposed to serve as a baseline for progress in any talks with Pyongyang. But the administration has still not delivered the report. At the summit in Hanoi, Trump will try to persuade North Korea to agree to concrete steps to abandon its nuclear weapons program, but the two sides have so far failed to agree on a definition of what denuclearization should entail. "I don't know if North Korea has made the choice yet to denuclearize, but the reason why we're engaged in this is because we believe there's a possibility that North Korea can make the choice to fully denuclearize," a senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told reporters on Thursday. "And that's why the President has assigned such a priority to engaging with them." Trump has said that North Korea's decision not to carry out missile and nuclear testing in recent months — and his rapport with Kim — offers proof that his approach is making diplomatic progress. North Korea, meanwhile, is pushing for lifting international economic sanctions, which it blames in part for contributing to food shortages in the isolated state. North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, appealed for food aid in a recent memo to the UN obtained by NBC News. The senior North Korean official said his country is facing dwindling food supplies and has been forced to reduce food rations for its people, according to the memo.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/22/magazine/john-legend-r-kelly-me-too.html---split---Interview by DAVID MARCHESE FEB. 22, 2019 “Within the last 18 months, someone said R. Kelly had a good song for me. I said no.” John Legend on Kanye West, political music and morality in art. In January, John Legend drew widespread praise as the most prominent musician to speak out against R. Kelly’s decades of sexual-assault allegations in Lifetime’s much discussed “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary. The reaction was further proof that even aside from his own music, the 40-year-old has a knack for getting people to look squarely at what matters. It’s an odd gift, given Legend’s air of imperturbability, and one often expressed in more playful ways, as anyone who follows his wife Chrissy Teigen’s frequently viral social media accounts knows. But now Legend’s calm-in-the-storm charisma can be both seen and heard in the video for his new single, “Preach,” a gospel-influenced cry against political inaction. In it the singer appears as a pastor at a protest rally. Amid the smoke and riot gear, it’s Legend’s righteous quietude that lingers in the mind. Which is not an accident. “Part of what I’ve been able to do,” Legend says, “is put a sympathetic face on some radical actions.” You’ve said, in previous interviews, that people in the arts are probably more inclined toward empathy than others. How do you square that belief with how so many in the entertainment world, for so long, implicitly condoned the behavior that people like R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein have been accused of?1 Even though I think artists are more geared to be empathetic, people ignore evil behavior when it comes with success and power and quality art — R. Kelly and Harvey Weinstein are responsible for some exceptional art.People were willing to look the other way until it really smacked them in the face. Have you ever made a moral decision to not work with someone? I was offered songs by R. Kelly! Within the last 18 months, someone said R. Kelly had a good song for me. I said no. Why do you think the music industry hasn’t had the same degree of #MeToo reckoning that the film business has? It’s not less misogynistic. Clearly not. But if you look at who’s gotten in trouble in the movie business, it’s been Harvey, and his victims were famous; they’re the perfect victims as far as publicity goes. Whereas in the music business, a lot of this might have happened on the road with fairly anonymous people as victims. A girl on tour in Oklahoma City is not the same as Gwyneth Paltrow. There’s an imbalance. In the case of R. Kelly, did his targeting of young black women complicate things? Jim DeRogatis2 said, years ago, that reporting on R. Kelly showed him that nobody matters less in society than young black women. When victims don’t have status, their victimhood often isn’t as valuable as other people’s. And in R. Kelly’s situation, that was combined with a reflex in the black community to rally around our men, who are often the subject of unfair prosecution. But we’ve got to reconsider that dynamic when it comes to protecting victims of sexual abuse, because some of the perpetrators are going to look like us. I was just looking at your Twitter mentions, and people were calling you hypocritical for speaking out against R. Kelly while also having participated in a tribute to Elvis Presley, who had a relationship with a 14-year-old. Is there any validity to that line of argument? There’s people saying, “Here’s a white guy who did this, and you weren’t as hard on him as you were on R. Kelly.” People think they’re being pro-black by saying that, but they’re not. What they’re really saying is that they want their guy to be free at the expense of these black girls they don’t care about. I’m not the morality police, and I’ve had my own failings, but at some point you’ve got to draw a line. I feel like a reasonable line would be not working with R. Kelly. What’s a personal failing of yours? We’ve all been dishonest. We’ve all been unfair. We’ve all taken advantage of the fact that we’re powerful. Last year you exchanged some texts with Kanye West, which he then posted online, criticizing his support of President Trump.3 You told him that he had the power to change people’s minds in favor of the president, which is a position you’re obviously against. But whose mind do you think is being changed about Donald Trump by Kanye West? Who is that person? Honestly, after I said it, I was like, “I’m not sure Kanye’s going to change many minds.” I think it’s more that he might make a certain person feel prouder about having the pro-Trump opinion. Do you and Kanye often have discussions about these things? We’ve had them. I’ve given my analysis of why Kanye thinks the way he does about Trump: He sees himself in him. Has that analysis been confirmed by Kanye? Yes, through the conversations we’ve had. He sees that underdog attitude; he sees the simple marketing message, and he’s excited by it. There’s a lot they have in common, attitude-wise. Kanye has openly said he wants to run for president. Do you ever think it’s provocation for its own sake with him? Kanye’s thinking about everything he does, but I don’t think he’s secretly like, “I’m just doing this so people will talk about me.” I think he’s being honest. “Preach” is a protest song. What’s the political function of a song like that in 2019? It’s supposed to do what art does: make people think and feel. I don’t look at it like, “I want this to lead specifically to that.” There’s got to be a lot more than a song to lead to someone’s doing something. So what compelled “Preach”? It was brought to me by some other writers, Greg Kurstin and Sarah Aarons, and I ended up kind of rewriting it from my own perspective. I was thinking of people like Emma González and the kids down in Parkland. We go through this ritual where politicians act like all they can do is hope and pray that a school shooting won’t happen again. I wanted to make a statement against that kind of passivity. It’s one thing for someone like Emma González, who has experienced a traumatic event, to be moved to political activism, but what gives you hope that enough people who haven’t had firsthand experience won’t stay complacent? I think back to what all of us supporters did last year with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.4 For decades, people with felonies on their records were not able to vote, and the threshold for passing that bill was, like, 60 percent. And it happened! So what gives me hope is that I’ve been involved in campaigns that worked. I’ve seen it. To what extent can art make people more empathetic? Is there an album you can point to and say it changed your thinking about a specific subject? I can’t say that about an album. I have seen the power of film to inspire action. And news coverage — the fact that cameras show up. Black Lives Matter would not have happened without cellphone footage. That’s not the same as creating a film, but visual media have spurred people to action. What’s an example of a film that spurred you to action? That’s a good question. Books definitely have done that. “The New Jim Crow” by Michelle Alexander got me excited about mass incarceration. I wouldn’t have started FreeAmerica5 unless I’d read that book. Have you gotten any pushback about your move, over the last few years, away from strictly personal songwriting and toward more politically informed music? Well, my biggest hit was “All of Me” in 2014, and I haven’t had as big a hit since. But I probably never was going to. So it’s hard for me to say that being more open in public about my politics and what I feel needs to change has had a financial effect, because we — everyone — sell fewer units now. Clearly people know that I’m on the left: Breitbart and some of these conservative outlets like to talk about me. I’m sure there are Americans that think, John Legend is a political enemy. But those people probably weren’t buying my music anyway. Aside from declining sales, what changes have you seen in the music business? I’m still old school in the sense that I think about an album as a body of work that is supposed to endure as a body of work. So maybe I’m out of pace with where the fans are, but it’s hard for me to deprogram and put out a random song here and there. What about as a listener? What changes have you heard? I’ll listen to successful albums that have great beats but very little when it comes to hooks. I don’t understand what would make you not want a hook. If there’s nothing to hook you — I don’t know. What are the fundamental differences in the way musicians like yourself, working in the R & B tradition, make music versus the way it was happening in, say, 1975? Up through the ’80s, people were playing actual instruments. The musicianship wasn’t as programmed as it is now. Since the blurring of the lines between hip-hop and R & B, the arrangement and production for R & B have taken on a lot of the characteristics of hip-hop. I think we’ve lost some of the musicality that we used to have in R & B. Are you comfortable with that shift? I’ve had fun working with hip-hop producers who use samples and drum machines. You can make great music that way, but sometimes you lose something when it’s just that. Even when I’ve worked with hip-hop producers, I would often layer live instruments on top of samples. I was uncomfortable feeling like the sound was all synthetic. I appreciate a lot of current music but some of it I’m like, “I will never understand why this is successful.” But I thought that way in the ’90s too. When I was a teenager, there was plenty on the radio where I thought, “This is crap.” Do you ever feel a conflict between being so embraced by an industry — you’ve got the EGOT6 — that plays a part in the systems that you also criticize politically? One of my friends texted me the other day because I had retweeted someone who was talking about the problem of cash bail; that’s an issue I’ve donated a lot of money to. My friend was basically like, “This is pretty radical what you’re saying.” But I don’t believe that what I think is radical. We’re the most incarcerated country in the world. That should be considered radical. Police are allowed to shoot unarmed black men in the street. That’s radical. Obviously I’m participating in capitalism. I do sponsorship deals with major corporations. I’m not radical in some ways, but remedies for mass incarceration shouldn’t be considered crazy. It should be considered crazy that we have mass incarceration in the first place. So you don’t feel any conflict between your political beliefs and your work? There is a natural tension, and I don’t think it’s meaningless. I just try to make a case for my political beliefs in a way that should make sense. But I was thinking about the central question you asked me at the beginning, whether socially conscious music changes behavior. I don’t think it changes a person’s point of view from one thing to another, but it can galvanize people already on your side. “Glory” put me on the Oscar stage,7 where I could talk about mass incarceration with millions of people watching. It wasn’t the only thing, but I think my getting involved in that conversation helped move it a bit to the left. How has your relationship with someone like Chrissy, who’s so popular and beloved on social media, altered the trajectory of your career? It’s changed it a lot. “All of Me” wouldn’t have existed without our relationship and that song put me on a higher career plane. Then there are people who enjoy our relationship,8 and that has a halo effect on everything we do. Brands buy into it. A lot of deals that we end up doing are done with the knowledge that our profile is raised because we’re together. What’s your hunch about why the public is so interested in you two? Part of it’s because Chrissy is who she is. She’s authentic. No matter who she would’ve been with, she would be funny, she would be interesting and she would be compelling to follow. But her being married to someone who’s also famous and whose biggest song is about her heightened our profile. It’s like my music set a precedent for us being more known, and then once people actually paid attention to her on social media —— That was the rocket fuel. Yeah, and people get the sense she’s one of them. She gets to be at the Oscars and these rarefied spaces as their proxy. And she doesn’t take it too seriously. She shows more quirks online than most people. Through our interaction online, my fans get to see a fun side of me that may not come out in my music. If it weren’t for her, I’d probably engage more conservatively online. You’ve been a professional musician since the early 2000s. But is it right that when you were younger, you briefly worked as a management consultant? Not briefly. It was three years. That was my first job. I went to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with good grades. A lot of my friends were applying to management-consulting firms and getting the best salaries coming out of school. So I thought maybe I should check it out. Please tell me you used the name John Legend as a business consultant. I did not. My name is John Roger Stephens. John Legend is a stage name. I do own the trademark, though. Back then I knew I wanted to do music, but I also knew music might not pay my rent. I figured I could work during the day as a management consultant and do music at night. So I applied to both McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group, the two biggest firms, and got hired at BCG. They offered me $50,000 a year and a signing bonus. My dad never made that much in a year, ever. Your dad was a tailor, right? His full-time job was as a factory worker. He and my mom would do alterations for our neighbors and friends to supplement their income whenever there’d be a plant shutdown or he got laid off. Did anything you learned as a consultant apply to your music career? It can’t hurt to understand how to deal with executives. I developed that acumen for three years. After that point I had to decide whether to go to business school in order to be able to continue in consulting. I was like, Nah, I’ve got to focus on music. I haven’t looked back.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/realestate/buying-abroad-with-a-logo.html---split---Supported by A growing number of home buyers are choosing to live in corporate-branded communities, with companies from Marriott to Porsche ready to greet them. By Marcelle Sussman Fischler After 16 years of hauling suitcases to the Four Seasons Resort Nevis, Ivan and Ann Highley-Gergel of Philadelphia no longer need to pack for vacations at the Caribbean island resort. About a year ago, the Highley-Gergels paid around $3.5 million for a furnished, four-bedroom villa that comes with a pool and a cottage and is operated by Four Seasons, allowing them to keep the bathing suits, flip-flops and tennis rackets at their otherwise turnkey vacation home. “It is wonderful not to have to put bags in the hold” of an airplane when they head south, said Dr. Highley-Gergel, 58, a psychiatrist, in a telephone interview from the island residence where he and his wife are spending a month this winter. The Highley-Gergels had sworn they would never buy a vacation home because of “the hassle,” but the convenience of buying at a branded development convinced them otherwise. From their private house, they have access to all the resort’s facilities, plus 24-hour security, room service, home maintenance and weekly cleanings. “We originally came here because we loved the Four Seasons,” Dr. Highley-Gergel said, adding that the couple “was looking for somewhere with a kids’ club,” for their two younger sons, then 5 and 7. The Highley-Gergels are among a growing number of Americans buying residences in brand-name resort properties, mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. Elsewhere around the world, international buyers are snapping up easy-to-lock-up-and-leave, high-rise residences under hotel banners like Mandarin Oriental, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and W, in cities from London to Barcelona to Bangkok. According to a Knight Frank “Global Branded Residences — 2019” report, branded residences are “growing exponentially and can now be found in almost every major city and major holiday destinations,” with more than 400 mostly hotel-branded residences in 60 countries. The Four Seasons, which opened its first homes in 1985, in Boston, manages about 4,000 residential units at 41 properties in 19 countries. In the next five years, its portfolio is expected to grow to more than 7,000 homes, said Paul White, president of residential at Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. More than 80 percent of all projects in its pipeline include a residential component, and eight of the nine new resorts scheduled to open this year will include residences for buyers who want to call Four Seasons their home. “It allows people to go from dating us to marrying us,” Mr. White said. In London, for instance, buyers looking to tie the knot with Four Seasons can do so at Twenty Grosvenor Square, A Four Seasons Residence, the hotelier’s new stand-alone project with 37 private residences, a wine cellar, spa, pool, game room and business center, amid private landscaped gardens in the high-end Mayfair neighborhood. About a mile away, the Residences at Mandarin Oriental Mayfair, with 80 luxury apartments, housekeeping and a rooftop bar, are slated to open in 2021. Liam Bailey, a partner and global head of research for Knight Frank, said that when someone decides to buy overseas, “you are stepping outside your comfort zone. People find that quite a big step to take.” By buying a home with, say, St. Regis or Ritz-Carlton, “you buy into a global brand,” Mr. Bailey said, one able to offer guidance on purchasing real estate in an unfamiliar country with unfamiliar tax laws and regulations. For those buying something that is still under construction, it instills confidence that the developer will deliver a completed product. It also makes leaving easier. “You are buying management, ultimately,” Mr. Bailey said. “When you lock up and leave and go back to your main residence, you know the property is maintained and looked after. You know they are looking after who is coming in and going out.” Mr. White noted that buying an overseas home under the marquee of a familiar brand also assuages buyers who may be nervous about immersing themselves in a foreign culture. “Americans aren’t the most adventurous travelers in the world,” he said. “Safety and security are becoming more important.” The model has become so popular, in fact, that brands beyond hotels are also attaching their luxury images to residential developments. The Italian jeweler Bulgari now offers residences in London and Dubai. French crystal maker Baccarat operates 60 homes in its Manhattan hotel. Fashion house Fendi is developing 41 Fendi Private Residences in Scottsdale, Ariz. At the Porsche Design Tower in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., residents can park their cars next to their apartments — even on the 50th floor. And just a few blocks away, 260 luxury residences are nearing completion in the 60-story Armani Casa tower. All that comes at a price. “If you have two developments sitting side by side and one has a recognizable global brand, it sells a bit faster, and at a premium,” said Rod Taylor, director of international residential developments for Savills London. “People are buying a brand they recognize. If they don’t know a town or a city very well, but they see a Four Seasons or a Mandarin, it gives them that warm, comfy feeling that they can actually go ahead and buy.” Simon Jacobs, an investor from Manhattan, long considered buying a vacation home in the Caribbean, but he didn’t know where. He was after something with a beachfront, and that was reachable via nonstop flight. “I didn’t want to have to deal with any of the issues,” he said. After checking out possibilities in Anguilla, St. Barts, Barbados, and Turks and Caicos, Mr. Jacobs, 58, his wife Eliana and their two daughters found their dream island home during a Christmas 2015 stay at the Viceroy Sugar Beach, a resort on an old sugar plantation on St. Lucia that offers privately owned, one- to four-bedroom residences. “These new residences they were building were right on the beach and there weren’t dozens of them,” Mr. Jacobs said. They were set between the Piton mountains and the Caribbean Sea, and he had “never seen anything that was that beautiful.” They could also be rented out through the Viceroy hotel system when the family wasn’t there. That May, he paid about $8.25 million for one of the hotel’s five new contemporary beachfront residences, personalizing the 4,200-square-foot house with a double-height living and dining room, a media room and a closet to store snorkeling gear. Since the house was completed a year ago, the Jacobses, who also have a weekend home in Connecticut and summer in Europe, have only been there a few times. “You use it when you want it, and when you don’t want it, it is available,” Mr. Jacobs said, noting that the rent he collects offsets his homeowner fees. “You get income. You have no ownership cost.” The Jacobses plan to return at the end of February and again in late March. “It is rented through the summer,” Mr. Jacobs said. “It’s part investment and part nice to have a house to come to that’s your own.” Penny Strawson, the property director of Sugar Beach Residences, said many owners — typically those looking forward to retirement — rent out the houses “a great deal to start with and then use them more as they reach retirement. They made their return.” But as sales volume rises at branded communities, the average age is falling. Mr. White, of the Four Seasons, said buyers were “younger than expected,” spanning several generations. At resort properties, multigenerational clients are important. “We will see a family buy a residence and bring the grandparents and kids along and use it as a vehicle to build a great legacy and memories,” he said. Sagar Desai, the global head of acquisitions and development for Viceroy Resorts, said condo hotels and resort residences started as a way “to help developers financially engineer their deals,” then “morphed into a very unique way to satisfy the needs of guests” who wanted to own homes. Viceroy is currently building residences at new resorts in Panama, Portugal and Mexico. The communities “make it effortless for you to buy something,” Mr. Desai said. “You don’t have to worry about calling the landscaper.” Often, buyers are looking for more than swimming pools and spas. The Four Seasons Palazzo Tornabuoni, popular with Americans and Canadians, houses 37 apartments in a restored 16th-century palace in Florence, Italy, and offers a calendar of lectures and events (wild boar hunting, anyone?) “which you generally wouldn’t find in a residential complex in that location,” Mr. Bailey said. Homeowners also are offered tours to other cities and towns, to help them engage with local culture. Tim Grisius, the global real estate officer of Marriott, which owns Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, Starwood, W and 10 other luxury and premium brands, said their residential business started about 20 years ago with a Ritz-Carlton residence conceived mostly as a way to grow the company’s hotel portfolio. Now, Mr. Grisius said, “The residential business has become substantial enough that it has become a nice business on its own.” Marriott currently has 11 stand-alone residential projects in the works — from a Ritz-Carlton in Singapore to a St. Regis in Dubai and a Marriott in Cairo — as well as eight others in the pipeline. While the residential business used to be largely in the United States, 40 percent is now international, with 80 percent of the pipeline outside the U.S. “Globally, we are seeing a significant portion of luxury hotels including a residential component because they work really well together,” Mr. Grisius said. When the Trump Organization launched its Trump International Realty brokerage in 2012, its first project in South America was a luxury residential tower in Punta del Este, a resort area in Uruguay. The building, slated to open in 2020, is not owned by Trump but will bear his brand. About 84 percent of about 160 units have been sold, and the first condos are expected to close by the end of 2019, said Juan Jose Cugliandolo, chief executive of YY, the developer. The Trump Organization currently has 10 properties completed or in development, according to a 2018 report on branded residences by Savills, which lists the organization as the 11th-largest individual residence brand worldwide. As a wider range of brands enters the market, offerings are also being expanded to include people who are not phenomenally wealthy. In 2017, Andrew Ashcroft, a developer, approached Marriott about making Alaia, a 155-unit complex on the barrier reef of Belize’s Ambergris Caye, part of the chain’s Autograph Collection. “I still want my sense of style, but the power of the Marriott brand,” he said. “Everyone wants to own a piece of paradise,” he said, “but it is a big decision to buy real estate offshore.” Slated to open next year, the complex will include studios at $199,000, one-bedrooms at $419,000, two-bedrooms for $649,000, three-bedrooms for $799,000 and eight beachfront villas priced at $1.3 million. Twenty-five percent of inventory is sold, Mr. Ashcroft said, and 85 percent of the buyers are American. “If you go to more expensive markets, like Turks and Caicos, $1.3 million will get you a one-bedroom in a tower,” he said. In Belize, “$1.3 million will get you a three-bedroom villa walking out onto the beach.” Four Seasons also has its eyes on Belize, developing 85 residences as part of a new complex on Caye Chapel, a 280-acre private barrier island, slated to open in 2021. Even as international locales explode in popularity, though, the Savills report notes that the U.S. remains by far the largest market for branded residences, with 32 percent of the globe’s supply. Four years ago, Mark and Tori Smith of Denver purchased a 3,500-square-foot, three-bedroom condo for $3.5 million at the Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve, in Dorado, Puerto Rico. When Hurricane Maria hurtled toward the island two years later, the Smiths left before it landed, worried they might lose their investment. “I have never lived in an area where I had to worry about hurricanes,” said Mr. Smith, 64, the owner of a wealth management firm. “When this hurricane was coming, my wife said this place is built to be bombproof. We lost two ceiling fans on the outside and some water in the windows, but they didn’t break.” They got lucky. The resort suffered extensive damage and the hotel was closed for about a year, but the residents were allowed back when utilities were restored. Last October, Dorado Beach reopened with more than 300,000 new plantings and expanded facilities. Although the Smiths return to Denver every month, they spend a total of five months and a day at the Dorado — the minimum required to call Puerto Rico their permanent residence. Mr. Smith said he would have been happy had they selected “a high-end condo with first class services,” but the Ritz-Carlton “has always carried a brand name in terms of quality and service and ambience. That had an appeal to us.” Advertisement

---split---4.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/border-smart-wall-privacy-surveillance/---split---After years of promises about a physical wall stretching along the US-Mexico border, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency last week in an attempt to secure wall funding in spite of congressional opposition. But physical barriers alone have always been both ineffective and expensive. And the constant debate around that singular aspect has distracted from a much more pressing issue: how the US can expand its use of technology for screening and enforcement at the border without overstepping already strained privacy rights. Border security technologies, like surveillance drones and biometric identity schemes, received funding in the most recent spending bill from Congress as an alternative to Trump's physical wall. But privacy advocates long have argued that a "smart wall," often called a "smart fence," can pose real threats to human rights—not just at checkpoints and processing facilities, but for anyone within the 100-mile-wide "border zone" in which US Customs and Border Protection has jurisdiction. The discourse, in other words, shouldn't end at the wall. "The way that this debate has been weaponized has really shut down a big portion of the conversation that we should be having," says Evan Greer, deputy director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future. "Congress should be providing more oversight, and should be specifying no, you can’t spend this money that we’re giving you on technologies that violate people’s human rights and civil liberties. Thus far they’ve largely failed to do that." Drones used in aerial surveillance, along with tools like license plate readers used by CBP in the broader border zone, create the potential for large-scale surveillance dragnets that could record vast amounts of data over time. CBP also has been known to share this data—and even use of its drones—with other law enforcement agencies at both the federal and state levels, expanding the impact of these tools beyond the border. "Technology deployment and investment at the border is not new. This is something that Congress has invested in repeatedly," says Mana Azarmi, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. "Some technologies are more invasive than others. Some tools allow CBP to identify, track, and monitor individuals. And people, particularly people living at the border, shouldn’t have to have the government monitor when they go to the doctor or to their place of worship." The concerns extend beyond physical surveillance. With few limits on how biometric techniques like facial recognition are deployed, that sensitive data could be shared in contexts beyond the border, potentially without individuals' consent, especially when they are non-US citizens. And while DNA testing is not yet a widely used identity mechanism for border protection, it gets considered more and more for pilot programs and trials, particularly in processing asylum seekers and reuniting separated families. "People living at the border shouldn’t have to have the government monitor when they go to the doctor or to their place of worship." Mana Azarmi, Center for Democracy and Technology CBP also has begun to use "algorithmic risk assessment" systems in border screening to help determine who potentially merits more questioning. Advocates of these tools argue that they could reduce the need for other types of border surveillance and physical barriers by providing a fair and reliable assessment of people attempting to cross the border. But privacy experts warn that relying on algorithms without oversight can result in biased and inscrutable enforcement actions. On top of all of this, CBP device searches have only become more aggressive at US ports of entry and borders. The agency has been emboldened over the last few years to go through things like travelers' social media accounts and messages, and even ask that they share their account passwords. More broadly, Fight for the Future's Greer notes that in response to Trump, a "smart wall" has been positioned as a more reasonable and cost-effective alternative to a physical barrier. But that framing potentially creates a false impression about how and why border security technology should be developed. The tools aren't a silver bullet, no matter how much gets spent on them, and there other components like drug and immigration policy that must factor in as well. "Low-cost adaptations will inevitably be found for the next generation of border surveillance technology," says Brandon Behlendorf, a homeland security researcher at SUNY-Albany. "Individuals interested in entering the country will find low-cost ways to defeat the technology. For example, migrants have used space blankets to protect their visible heat signature, overcoming thermal imagery." For those attempting to steer the conversation toward border privacy risks, discussion about Trump's wall has stolen the focus for years now. But the discussion certainly has also brought more attention to border security issues overall. "Perhaps a silver lining is that we can take the time to really be analytical and thoughtful about what we’re doing at the border," CDT's Azarmi says. "How we’re using technology, what privacy and civil liberties issues are at stake—maybe this is the opportune time to have there be greater oversight of DHS, of CBP, and put in some guardrails to protect the privacy of US persons and non-US persons." It's that kind of nuance that has gone missing almost entirely. And anyone who finds themselves in the border zone may feel the impact. There are many ways to kill a drone. But what's the cheapest and most effective way to do it? A cybersecurity consultancy is testing various ways to defend against rogue drones. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Schwartz Hassan Shibly, attorney for the family of Hoda Muthana, says she was a "vulnerable young woman who was brainwashed and manipulated." Chris O'Meara/AP hide caption Hassan Shibly, attorney for the family of Hoda Muthana, says she was a "vulnerable young woman who was brainwashed and manipulated." An Alabama woman who traveled to Syria and became the bride of an Islamic State fighter wants to be allowed back into the United States, but President Trump won't allow it. "I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!" Trump wrote Wednesday on Twitter. I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country! Muthana was 20 years old when she told her family that she was going to Turkey for a university event. She then made her way to Syria and joined ISIS, became romantically involved with multiple ISIS fighters, had a child with one of them and allegedly spent several years urging attacks on America. Now Muthana wants to come home. The 24-year-old regrets falling in with the terrorist group that brainwashed her online, a lawyer for the family told NPR's David Greene on Morning Edition. "People are saying she betrayed this country, she shouldn't be able to come back home," Hassan Shibly said. But Muthana was a "vulnerable young woman who was brainwashed and manipulated by these criminal masterminds. They took advantage of her and used her, and she deeply, deeply resents them. She deeply regrets it." Muthana isn't looking for a "free pass," Shibly said. "She's asking that she can come and face our legal system and pay whatever debt she may have to society and speak out to ensure other people aren't trafficked and brainwashed and abused as she was." Trump has asked European countries to hold criminal proceedings for their own citizens that joined ISIS. But Pompeo said in a statement that Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the country. "She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States," Pompeo said, adding: "We continue to strongly advise all U.S. citizens not to travel to Syria." This image provided by attorney Hassan Shibly shows Hoda Muthana, an Alabama woman who left home to join the Islamic State after becoming radicalized online. Hoda Muthana/Attorney Hassan Shibly via AP hide caption This image provided by attorney Hassan Shibly shows Hoda Muthana, an Alabama woman who left home to join the Islamic State after becoming radicalized online. Muthana was captured by Kurdish forces after fleeing land controlled by ISIS, The Guardian reported, calling her "once one of Isis's most prominent online agitators who took to social media to call for the blood of Americans to be spilled." Muthana married an Australian jihadist, who was killed while fighting. She then married a Tunisian fighter and bore a son named Adam, now 18 months old. After that husband was killed, Muthana briefly married a Syrian fighter. All the while, according to accusations, Muthana urged Americans to kill in the name of ISIS. "Americans wake up!" she wrote on Twitter in 2015, according to a profile in BuzzFeed News. "Men and women altogether. You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them." "Look, it's no secret that Hoda really did go off the deep end," Shibly told NPR. "I mean there was a point where she was calling myself and her parents infidels. She really was fully brainwashed. She was irrational. And now she tremendously, tremendously regrets it. I think she's awoken from their spell." "I thought I was doing things correctly for the sake of God," Muthana told the Guardian. But she has changed, she told ABC News. "I hope they excuse me because of how young and ignorant I was," she said. "And now I have none of the ideology. And hopefully everyone will see it when I get back." Although Pompeo said Muthana isn't a citizen, she and her family say she is a citizen from Alabama, NPR's Ruth Sherlock told All Things Considered. Shibly told the NPR that he plans to file a legal challenge to the government's decision to bar her from the country. The issue is now one of due process and birthright citizenship, Shibly said. "The Trump Administration is using this as a test case to revoke an individual's birthright citizenship. It's very clear she was a citizen when she was born," he said. "If they're able to strip somebody of citizenship without the court process, without due process, that's tremendous executive overreach." Muthana has been living in the same refugee camp as British citizen Shamima Begum, who left the U.K. and married an ISIS fighter. The British government has said it would revoke her citizenship.  In a previous version of this story, we twice misspelled Hoda Muthana's last name as Mothana.  NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/08/border-apprehensions-of-migrant-families-have-risen-substantially-so-far-in-2018/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Kristen Bialik There were nearly 467,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, the most for any calendar year since at least 2012, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the most recent available data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The increase was driven in part by a dramatic spike in border apprehensions of family members at the end of last year. Despite the increase, the number of border apprehensions in 2018 remained far below the levels throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, when around 1 million or more migrants were being apprehended each fiscal year. The situation at the southwest border has become the focus of the now nearly month-long partial federal government shutdown. President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders are at an impasse over Trump’s proposal for a wall at the border. In the months leading up to the shutdown, there was a large increase in the number of people in family units apprehended at the border. Monthly family apprehensions subsequently hit new highs each month from September through December, according to data going back to 2012. There were nearly 17,000 family member apprehensions in September, more than 23,000 in October, about 25,000 in November and a record of more than 27,000 in December. All told, roughly 163,000 family members were apprehended last year – more than three times as many as in 2017, and the highest number since at least 2012.  Family members accounted for about a third (35%) of all border apprehensions in 2018 – the highest share within the past seven years. The months leading up to the shutdown drove this increase: Family member apprehensions in December made up more than half (54%) of total southwest border apprehensions that month, the fourth consecutive high since September (40%). Border agents also apprehended nearly 54,000 unaccompanied children in 2018 – or 12% of the total – though this share was lower than in 2014 through 2016 (each 14%). (Unaccompanied child apprehensions do not include children who were apprehended as a family unit and later became unaccompanied as a result of prosecution initiatives.) Besides unaccompanied children and family members, single adults continue to account for the largest share of border apprehensions: In 2018 there were nearly 250,000 single adult apprehensions, or 54% of the total. Still, the recent surge in family unit apprehensions is particularly notable because December 2018 marks the third time family member apprehensions exceeded single adult apprehensions, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The other two times were in October and November. The apprehension of families and unaccompanied children received renewed attention following the Trump administration’s announcement of a “zero tolerance” policy in April last year. The policy led families to be separated at the border starting in May, though Trump ended the policy in an executive order in late June. Family separations do still occur – such as when adult migrants traveling with children are apprehended at the border and deemed to be involved in criminal or gang activity – though more rarely than under the zero tolerance policy. From June 21 through November, 81 children were separated from 76 adult family members at the border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The vast majority of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors apprehended on the U.S.-Mexico border come from Mexico or the Northern Triangle region (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). (In December 2018, 95% of apprehended family members were from the Northern Triangle.) And in recent years, there have been more overall apprehensions of non-Mexicans than Mexicans at U.S. borders, reflecting a decline in the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. over the past decade. Many families are leaving countries with high levels of violent crime, a fact highlighted in 2017 by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who said “vicious gangs and vast criminal organizations” drive illegal immigration to the U.S. In 2016, El Salvador had the world’s highest murder rate (82.8 homicides per 10,000 people), followed by Honduras (at a rate of 56.5). Guatemala was 10th (at 27.3), according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Poverty represents another motivating force for migration from Central America. Northern Triangle nations are among the poorest in Latin America, and although some have seen a reduction of extreme poverty in recent years, high shares of people still live on less than $2 a day (the international poverty line is $1.90). Within Latin America and the Caribbean, Honduras has the second-highest share (16%) of people below the international poverty line, after Haiti (24%), according to the latest data from the World Bank. Guatemala is fourth-highest at 9%. In El Salvador, 2% of people live below $2 a day. Given the level of poverty in the region, some migrants seek out economic opportunity in the U.S. in hopes of sending money back to their home countries. Most remittance dollars flowing to Latin America come from the U.S., and for Northern Triangle countries in particular, remittances make up a relatively large share of each country’s gross domestic product. In Honduras, for example, remittances were 19% of the nation’s GDP in 2017, according to data from the World Bank. In comparison, remittances were about 3% of Mexico’s GDP last year. For unaccompanied children, family reunification could also be a strong driver. Among children from the Northern Triangle who were apprehended by the U.S. between January 2014 and April 2015, 60% were released to a parent already living in the U.S. Fewer than 10% were released to a non-family sponsor, such as a family friend or a person the family had no previous relationship with, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Broadly speaking, people around the world agree that climate change poses a severe risk to their countries, according to a 26-nation survey conducted in the spring of 2018. In 13 of these countries, people name climate change as the top international threat. But global warming is just one of many concerns. Terrorism, specifically from the Islamic extremist group known as ISIS, and cyberattacks are also seen by many as major security threats. In eight of the countries surveyed, including Russia, France, Indonesia and Nigeria, ISIS is seen as the top threat. In four nations, including Japan and the United States, people see cyberattacks from other countries as their top international concern. One country, Poland, names Russia’s power and influence as its top threat, but few elsewhere say Russia is a major concern.  __ is a major threat to our country Note: “*” indicates the question was not asked in the country. Source: Spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey.  Many people also express fears about North Korea’s nuclear program, but in none of the 26 countries do people rate it as one of their top two concerns (even in neighboring South Korea). Fewer still rate the condition of the global economy as their top international concern, although it remains a pertinent issue in many countries, especially in places where ratings for the national economy are overwhelmingly negative, such as Greece and Brazil. And while a median of less than half across the nations in the survey say the influence of the U.S. is a major threat to their countries, more people now say it is a threat than in 2013 and 2017. Indeed, in 10 countries, roughly half or more now claim that American power is a major threat to their nation – including 64% who say this in Mexico, where ratings for the U.S. have turned sharply negative since the election of President Donald Trump. At the bottom of the threats list is China’s power and influence, although roughly half or more in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and the U.S. name China as a major threat. These are among the findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 27,612 respondents in 26 countries from May 14 to Aug. 12, 2018. There have been substantial changes over time on many of the eight international threats asked about in the 2018 survey. For example, in 2013, well before the Paris climate agreement was signed, a median of 56% across 23 countries surveyed said global climate change was a major threat to their country. That climbed to 63% in 2017, and in 2018 it stands at 67%. Since 2013, worries about the climate threat have increased significantly in 13 of the countries where data are available. The biggest increases have been in France (up 29 percentage points) and Mexico (up 28 points), but there have been double-digit rises in the U.S., UK, Germany, Spain, Kenya, Canada, South Africa and Poland as well. In 2013, a little less than half across the countries surveyed said North Korea’s nuclear program was a major threat (47%). But in 2018, a median of 55% name the issue as a major threat. Worries about the nuclear threat have risen substantially in many countries over the past five years, especially in the countries surveyed across Africa and Latin America. There has also been a substantial jump in those who see cyberattacks from other countries as a top threat. In 2018, a median of 61% across the countries see cyberthreats as a serious concern, up from 54% who said this in 2017. In the past few years there have been multiple headline-grabbing cybersecurity breaches in places as varied as the U.S., Japan and South Africa. Since 2017, there have been double-digit rises in those saying cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to their country in Tunisia (up 25 percentage points), the Netherlands (+15 points), Greece (+12), Sweden (+11) and Canada (+10). Meanwhile, there has been a decrease since 2017 in the number of countries that see ISIS as the top security threat. Substantial double-digit declines among those saying ISIS is a major threat occurred over the past year in Israel (down 16 points), Spain (-13), the U.S. (-12), Greece (-10) and Japan (-10). Views on the global economy and China as major threats have remained roughly the same since 2017. The largest change in sentiment among the global threats tracked are for those who see U.S. power and influence as a major threat to their countries. In 2013, only a quarter across 22 nations saw American power as a major threat to their country, but that jumped substantially to 38% in 2017, the year after Trump was elected president, and to 45% in 2018. In fact, in 18 of the 22 countries surveyed in both 2013, when Barack Obama was the U.S. president, and 2018, there has been a statistically significant increase in those who name the U.S. as a major threat. This includes increases of 30 percentage points in Germany, 29 points in France and 26 points in Brazil and Mexico. There is also a strong connection between seeing America as a threat and lack of confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump. In 17 of the countries surveyed, people who have little or no confidence in the U.S. president are more likely than those who do have confidence in Trump to name U.S. power and influence as a top threat. This difference is most acute among America’s traditional allies, such as Canada, the UK and Australia, where overall views of the U.S. and its president have plummeted in recent years. Across the 10 European countries surveyed, climate change and ISIS are clearly seen as major international threats, although a median of about half or more also name cyberattacks and North Korea’s nuclear program as top concerns. Russia’s power and influence is seen as a major threat by a median of four-in-ten across the continent, about the same share that sees U.S. power and influence as a threat (median of 37%). Meanwhile, only 35% see the condition of the global economy as a major threat, as European countries have mostly recovered from the Great Recession and subsequent euro crisis. A median of 31% see China as a major threat. In terms of individual nations surveyed within Europe, majorities in every country name climate change and ISIS as major threats to their countries. However, six of these countries offer climate change as the top concern, while only two name ISIS. In the Netherlands, more people say cyberattacks from other countries is the top threat, while in Poland, more say Russia’s power and influence is their major international concern. And while few across Europe say the condition of the global economy is a major threat to their country, 88% in Greece do. Despite some rising concerns about American power and influence, no more than half in any European country say U.S. power is a major threat, although nearly half hold this view in France (49%), Germany (49%) and Greece (48%). Since 2013, there has been a significant increase in the share naming climate change a major threat in seven of the European countries surveyed in both years. This includes a 29-percentage-point increase in France, an 18-point increase in the UK, 17 points in Spain and 15 points in Germany. There are some notable differences between American and Canadian views about the top threats facing their countries. Americans are chiefly concerned about cyberattacks, although majorities also see ISIS (62%), climate change (59%) and North Korea’s nuclear program (58%) as major threats. Since 2017, worries about ISIS are down 12 percentage points among Americans. By contrast, more Canadians say global climate change is a major threat to their country than say the same about cyberattacks (57%) or ISIS (54%). Cybersecurity has grown as a concern in Canada since 2017, when fewer than half (47%) said it was a major threat. Russians are relatively untroubled by cyberattacks from other countries (only 36% say it is a major threat) but are concerned about ISIS (62% major threat). Generally, Russians are among the least concerned about all the various threats tested in the survey relative to other countries. On a variety of threats, but especially on climate change and ISIS, there are sharp ideological and partisan divides in Europe and North America. For example, in the U.S., Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party are 56 percentage points less likely to believe that global climate change is a major threat to their country than are Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party. While this partisan divide is substantial, it is not unique. In Europe, supporters of some right-wing populist parties are less concerned than others about climate change. For instance, those with a favorable view of Alternative for Germany (AfD) are 28 percentage points less likely to say that climate change is a major threat to their country than those who do not support that party. Double-digit differences on this issue also appear between supporters and nonsupporters of UKIP in the UK, National Front (now National Rally) in France, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, and the Sweden Democrats in Sweden. There are also strong ideological divides on the threat perceptions of climate change and ISIS across Europe and North America. In nine of the 12 European and North American countries surveyed, those on the ideological left are more concerned about the threat of global climate change than those on the right. This is especially the case in the U.S., where nearly nine-in-ten (87%) among those on the left say global warming is a top concern, versus only 31% on the right who say this. Conversely, those on the political right in Europe and North America are often more concerned about ISIS than are those on the left. This includes ideological differences of more than 20 percentage points in the Netherlands, Canada, the U.S. and Sweden on the ISIS threat. A slight education divide on the threat of climate change exists in many European and North American countries surveyed, where those with more education are more inclined to say it is a threat than those with less education. In contrast to worries about climate change, in eight countries, those with less education are more likely to say ISIS is a major threat than their more-educated counterparts. Women in many countries surveyed are also more concerned about the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program than are men. Overall, double-digit differences between men and women on the North Korean threat appear in nine of the countries surveyed in Europe and North America, with the biggest gap in Sweden. In seven countries, women are more concerned about climate change than are men. In Poland, 61% of women name it as a major threat, compared with 48% of men. Women are also generally more worried than men about the ISIS threat (this is true in 10 countries in North America and Europe). On the risk posed by ISIS, there are significant age divides in many of the countries surveyed. For example, in Germany, 78% of those ages 50 and older are worried about the ISIS threat, compared with only 42% among 18- to 29-year-old Germans. Across the five Asia-Pacific countries surveyed, cyberattacks, climate change and ISIS are all mentioned as top concerns by at least one country. In Japan, it is cyberattacks, while in South Korea and Australia, it is climate change. ISIS is named as the top threat in the Philippines and Indonesia, nations where Islamic extremist violence has occurred frequently over the past 15 years. Asia-Pacific publics also express concern about North Korea’s nuclear program and China’s power and influence. In South Korea, more rate China’s power as a major threat (82%) than the DPRK’s nuclear program (67%). Since 2013, concern about North Korea has fallen substantially in South Korea, from 82% in 2013 to 67% in 2018. Over that time, perceptions of China as a threat have grown in four of the nations surveyed in the region, particularly in Australia (up 20 points) and Indonesia (up 16). Among the three Latin American countries surveyed, global climate change continues to rank as the top concern, extending an established trend. Eight-in-ten Mexicans say climate change is a major threat, marking an 8-percentage-point increase from 2017 and a 28-point increase since the question was first asked in 2013. Almost three-quarters of Argentines (73%) and Brazilians (72%) name climate change as a major threat. Education plays a significant role in how Latin American respondents evaluate the climate change threat. In Brazil, for example, more than eight-in-ten (84%) of those with a secondary education or higher say climate change is a major threat, compared with 62% of those with less education – a 22-point difference. Additionally, 85% of Brazilians in the ideological center are concerned about climate change, versus 74% of those on the left and 69% among the ideological right. Majorities in the Latin America region express significant concern about the condition of the global economy. More than six-in-ten in all three countries surveyed there name it a large threat, making it the second-highest concern in Argentina and Brazil and the third-highest in Mexico. Half or more of people in these nations also see North Korea’s nuclear program and cyberattacks from other countries as major threats. The three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed express distinct top concerns. ISIS stands out as the greatest threat in Nigeria, where the ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa have a strong presence. About six-in-ten (61%) categorize the group as a major concern, an 8-point increase since the question was first asked in 2016. In Kenya, where droughts and extreme weather events have negatively affected agriculture, the public feels most threatened by global climate change (71%). This is true across gender, age, income and education groups. Majorities also see ISIS, cyberattacks, the global economy and North Korea’s nuclear program as major threats.1 For South Africans, cyberattacks from abroad are considered most threatening; 61% categorize them as a large threat. Climate change closely follows as a significant concern, with roughly six-in-ten respondents (59%) naming it as a major threat. Education and income are linked to concern about climate change in South Africa: Those with more education or incomes higher than the median are more likely to see climate change as a major threat. Across the Middle Eastern, sub-Saharan African and Latin American countries surveyed, there are a variety of international concerns, but generally, climate change and ISIS are seen as top threats. In both Tunisia and Israel, ISIS is considered the top threat. Roughly eight-in-ten Tunisians (81%) see the militant Islamic group as a major threat. They are additionally apprehensive about the condition of the world economy, cyberattacks and climate change. About six-in-ten (61%) also say U.S. power and influence are a major threat to their country. Israelis also see ISIS as the top international threat among those tested. However, only 47% label it a major threat, illustrating Israel’s relatively low level of concern about all threat items tested. Roughly four-in-ten see cyberattacks (42%) and climate change (38%) as pressing threats. Jewish Israelis are more likely than the country’s Arabs to be worried about North Korea’s nuclear program, ISIS, cyberattacks from other countries and the condition of the global economy. On the other hand, Arabs are more likely to categorize U.S. power and influence as a large threat. Ideology also affects how Israelis perceive global threats. Israelis on the ideological right are more likely than those on the left to see North Korea’s nuclear program (42% vs. 21%) and ISIS (53% vs. 36%) as major threats. Those on the right are also less concerned about climate change (32% vs. 46%) and the condition of the global economy (35% vs. 49%) than are those on the left. Compared with concerns about Russian or Chinese influence, worries about U.S. power and influence are relatively high in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia. More than half in these countries say U.S. power is a major threat to their country. By comparison, concerns about the U.S. are relatively lower in sub-Saharan Africa and Israel. In none of these countries does a majority express concern about Russian or Chinese power. Apprehension about U.S. power has also increased over time in these countries. In Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia, concerns have gone up by more than 25 percentage points from 2013 to 2018. Worries have increased the least in Israel (up 6 points).

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/21/immigrants-temporary-protected-status-in-us/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By D’Vera Cohn, Jeffrey S. Passel and Kristen Bialik Many immigrants who have time-limited permission to live and work in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) face an uncertain future as the White House and lawmakers from both parties wrangle over immigration policy and border security issues. Roughly 318,000 people currently have this protected status after fleeing their countries because of war, hurricanes, earthquakes or other extraordinary conditions that could make it dangerous for them to live in that country. Nearly all are expected to lose their benefits either this year or next. Federal officials have said that TPS is meant to provide temporary rather than long-term relief. The Trump administration proposed extending Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 immigrants as part of a border wall deal to end the longest government shutdown in history earlier this year. Democrats opposed the proposed plan for several reasons, including new standards and higher fees for TPS applications. The Department of Homeland Security said last year that it would not extend Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from six of the 10 nations that are now eligible. Of those six nations, five (Sudan, Nicaragua, Nepal, Haiti and El Salvador) will face TPS expirations this year. TPS for Honduras expires in 2020. Only those from South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Somalia have received TPS extensions with the possibility of future extension. However, the decisions to end TPS for those from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador have been temporarily blocked by a federal court. And immigrant advocates recently filed a separate lawsuit challenging the decision to end TPS for those from Nepal and Honduras. The first groups expected to lose their benefits will be roughly 1,000 Sudanese and about 2,500 Nicaraguans whose benefits were extended through April 2 of this year. However, their benefits will continue while the court injunction remains in effect. Benefits for the largest group, about 195,000 people from El Salvador, are scheduled to expire this September. In all, immigrants with Temporary Protected Status were about 3% of the 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2016, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Yet this share was higher for some countries: Immigrants with TPS accounted for about a quarter of unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador (27%) and around 13% of those from Honduras in 2016, for example. (This analysis assumes that immigrants with TPS are in the U.S. without authorization.) Once the Department of Homeland Security designates a nation’s immigrants as eligible for Temporary Protected Status, immigrants may apply if they entered the U.S. without authorization or entered on a temporary visa that has expired. Applicants may also have a valid temporary visa or another non-immigrant status such as foreign student. To be granted TPS, applicants must meet filing deadlines, pay a fee and prove they have lived in the U.S. continuously since the events that triggered relief from deportation. They also must meet criminal-record requirements – for example, that they have not been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors while in the U.S., or been engaged in persecuting others or terrorism. Temporary Protected Status does not make individuals automatically eligible for permanent residence or U.S. citizenship, but some may apply for permanent lawful status. Federal officials are required to announce 60 days before any TPS designation expires whether it will be extended; without a decision, it automatically extends six months. Here is the status for the largest origin groups now protected under TPS, based on the most recent Federal Register notices for each country: EL SALVADOR In 2016, there were 725,000 unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador living in the U.S., and about a quarter of these (27%) had Temporary Protected Status, according to Pew Research Center estimates. As of 2018, U.S. government officials estimate that 195,000 individuals from El Salvador have TPS, which is scheduled to expire on Sept. 9. Though the Trump administration plans not to extend TPS for Salvadorans, this decision has been temporarily blocked by a federal court. The current TPS for El Salvador applies to immigrants who have lived in the U.S. since Feb. 13, 2001, following a series of earthquakes that killed more than a thousand people and inflicted widespread damage. Recovery has been slowed by a series of problems, including “hurricanes and tropical storms, heavy rains and flooding, volcanic and seismic activity, an ongoing coffee rust [fungus disease] epidemic, and a prolonged regional drought that is impacting food security,” according to a Federal Register notice explaining why the designation has repeatedly been extended. The notice also cited increasing violence and high unemployment. El Salvador’s government has asked that TPS be extended. HAITI There were about 100,000 unauthorized immigrants from Haiti in the U.S. in 2016 overall, according to the Center’s estimates. U.S. government officials estimate about 46,000 Haitian immigrants have Temporary Protected Status as of 2018. TPS benefits for Haitians are set to expire July 22, with no plans for extension, though the Trump administration’s decision to terminate TPS is also temporarily blocked by a federal court challenge. The TPS designation for Haiti was based on an earthquake that killed hundreds of thousands of people in January 2010. Immigrants also are eligible if they entered the U.S. up to a year later – so any Haitian immigrant with protected status has been in the U.S. since at least early 2011. In 2017, the Haitian government asked for an 18-month extension leading up to the July 22 termination, citing recent catastrophes including other hurricanes. HONDURAS and NICARAGUA There are 57,000 Hondurans and roughly 2,550 Nicaraguans with Temporary Protected Status, as of 2018 estimates. In 2016, there were an estimated 425,000 unauthorized immigrants from Honduras and around 70,000 from Nicaragua overall. Benefits expire for Nicaraguans (as well as for Sudanese) on April 2, with no plans for extension, though this is being challenged in court along with terminations for El Salvador and Haiti. Benefits for Hondurans expire Jan. 5, 2020, with no plans for extension. Immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua who qualify for TPS must have been living in the U.S. as of Dec. 30, 1998. Immigrants from both countries were designated eligible for TPS based on damage from Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The storm killed more than 5,600 people in Honduras and more than 3,000 in Nicaragua. The government of Honduras had also requested an extension of TPS. Damage in Honduras was at least $5 billion, and recovery has been hampered by tropical storms, drought and poverty, federal officials said when they last extended the TPS designation. In Nicaragua, damage was at least $1.3 billion, with a series of environmental disasters – including storms, earthquakes and a volcanic eruption – getting in the way of recovery efforts, federal officials said in extending that country’s TPS designation. Elaine Duke, then acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a 2017 announcement that conditions in Nicaragua had improved enough that the TPS designation would be terminated in January 2019, but that was later pushed back as a result of an injunction by a U.S. District Court. Because of data limitations, Pew Research Center has not estimated the TPS share of unauthorized immigrants from the other six countries. They include Nepal (with 8,950 immigrants with TPS), Somalia (500), South Sudan (70), Sudan (1,040), Syria (5,800) and Yemen (1,250). Congress and President George H.W. Bush authorized the TPS program in the 1990 immigration law, granting the White House executive power to designate and extend the status to immigrants in the U.S. based on certain criteria.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/forget-subpoenaing-trump-officials-house-democrats-can-just-let-trump-ncna974041---split---As the White House increasingly uses executive privilege to shield themselves from cooperating with congressional investigations, whistleblowers will be key to unlocking the secrets of what is really happening inside the Trump Administration. That became more evident this week, when “credible information” provided by multiple whistleblowers concerning the White House’s efforts to “rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia” led the House Committee on Oversight and Reform to announce a new investigation. According to an interim staff report, the whistleblowers expressed “significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connecting with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.” and “conflicts of interest among top White House advisors.” They additionally “warned about political appointees ignoring directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump Administration officials to halt their efforts.” Make no mistake about it, these whistleblowers are risking their livelihoods and careers because they believe our national security is being put in jeopardy. The bulk of our foreign policy decisions and alliances are driven by where nuclear technology is deployed and, in a region as politically unstable as the Middle East, there would be significant geopolitical consequences from a decision that allows Saudi Arabia to make advancements in nuclear technology with the blessing of the U.S. government. This is a decision that warrants as much transparency as possible given what is at stake globally. Congressional investigators have thus been given specific dates, documents, information and names of White House officials engaged in what the whistleblowers believe problematic activities related to the potential transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. Those documents call into question the interactions and activities of the Trump Administration’s most senior members — including Jared Kushner, energy secretary Rick Perry, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (who pled guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI), former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland, the inaugural committee chairman Thomas Barrack, and President Trump’s former Deputy Campaign Manager and deputy chairman of the inaugural committee Rick Gates (who has also pled guilty in the Mueller investigation). It seems highly irregular to have political figureheads like Barrack play such a hands-on role in high-stakes foreign policy decisions. The report reveals that, while serving as the national security advisor during Donald Trump’s campaign, General Michael Flynn advocated for the adoption of a plan — initiated by a private company called IP3 — for them to build a nuclear plant in Saudi Arabia. Flynn, though, had simultaneously served as an advisor to an IP3 subsidiary and traveled to Saudi Arabia on behalf of IP3 (a trip he omitted from his security clearance application). Flynn’s support for the plan would continue throughout the presidential transition and after he joined the White House as the President’s National Security Advisor. Despite warnings about potential criminal conflicts of interest from National Security Council ethics and legal advisors, the White House continued to move forward with Flynn’s plan, even after he’d been forced out over concerns about his contacts with Russian officials and the veracity of his accounts of those contacts with Vice President Pence. In a new letter from Chairman Cummings to Acting WH Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, questions are raised regarding a February 12, 2019 White House meeting in which the President reportedly expressed his support for transferring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia — a meeting that “was initiated by IP3 International.” And next week, Kushner — who, again, is named one of the people problematically involved in the potential transfer of nuclear technology — is scheduled to embark on a tour of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. Kushner, you may recall, offered Saudi’s crown prince advice about how to weather the public relations storm after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul at the alleged order of the crown prince. Even more troubling are the potential financial conflicts of interest that Kushner has that pose troubling questions surrounding his motives for being so willing to help the crown prince. As the committee’s interim report points out, in January of 2018, Brookfield Business Partners announced plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric, a bankrupt nuclear services company. This company is a key component of IP3’s efforts to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia. Then, in August of 2018, BBP’s parent company, Brookfield Asset Management, purchased a partnership stake in 666 Fifth Avenue, a building owned by Jared Kushner’s family company. Kushner reportedly divested his interest in this property when he joined his father-in-law’s administration, but his interactions with foreign officials in the Middle East — particularly as his family looked for a financial backer — are, at the very least, highly irregular. As Congressman Ted Lieu tweeted this week, “WHY DOES JARED KUSHNER STILL HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE?” That is, one suspects, a question that House Democrats are quite likely to try and answer — and they seem to be getting help. For all the media focus on the new Democratic majority’s subpoena powers, the role of whistleblowers within the federal government could become the most important intelligence gathering asset for congressional investigators.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-attacks-first-amendment-press-gain-ally-supreme-court-ncna973431---split---As part of his broader assault on the news media, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for a revisiting of American libel law — part of the law of defamation, which governs when individuals can sue those who have allegedly made false statements about them. On Tuesday, he found a powerful ally in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who penned an opinion encouraging his colleagues to revisit the court’s landmark 1964 ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan. The Sullivan case is one of the most important Supreme Court decisions interpreting the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom speech. By encouraging its demise, Thomas is not only proposing to arm Trump with a legal mechanism for going after his critics, he is also arguing that publicly criticizing public figures should come with far more risk. Although no other justice joined in his solo opinion, Thomas’s analysis suggests that Trump’s attacks on the press are resonating in some of the most important chambers of government — and will only embolden new lawsuits seeking to weaken Sullivan and the critical constitutional principle that it articulated. Although no other justice joined in his solo opinion, Thomas’s analysis suggests that Trump’s attacks on the press are resonating. The Sullivan decision came as part-and-parcel of the civil rights movement. On March 29, 1960, civil rights groups took out a full-page “editorial” advertisement in the New York Times criticizing unnamed authorities in Montgomery, Alabama, for violating the Constitution by abusing protestors and various other actions. L.B. Sullivan, a city commissioner, sued the Times, arguing that the advertisement defamed the reputation of the Montgomery police and included a few minor errors — such as suggesting that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been arrested seven times (as opposed to four). Alabama libel law at the time forced defendants to prove their statements were true, instead of presuming them true. Because the Times couldn’t prove that every statement in the advertisement was true, the jury ruled in Sullivan’s favor, and awarded $500,000 in damages. SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE In a sweeping opinion by Justice William Brennan, Jr., the Supreme Court unanimously reversed this verdict. As Brennan explained, “we consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” It may also include errors, Brennan explained, because “erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate.” But to allow states to punish all errors in statements about the official conduct of public figures would be antithetical to the purpose of the First Amendment, because “[w]hatever is added to the field of libel is taken from the field of free debate.” In other words, the Supreme Court believed that the extent to which the First Amendment shielded false speech about public officials was worth it compared to the far greater cost of chilling all Americans, and not just the press, from criticizing their government. This self-censorship was a natural outgrowth of the fear that even factually accurate criticisms could provoke costly litigation. That didn’t mean that a public official could never successfully sue for defamation. As Brennan explained, there would be no First Amendment defense if the official could show “actual malice” on the defendant’s part — “that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” But the burden must be on the public official to demonstrate such malice, rather than on the defendant to show good faith. Sullivan set forth a ringing defense of the right to criticize government officials and other public figures, even if it sometimes came at the expense of truth. In the process, Sullivan set forth a ringing defense of the right to criticize government officials and other public figures, even if it sometimes came at the expense of truth. And although the decision’s protections were not limited to the press, it was no accident that what followed was far more active — and skeptical — press coverage of national events, from civil rights demonstrations to the Vietnam War to Watergate, and beyond. As one media law scholar noted in 2017, Sullivan “recognized that a free press, however imperfect, is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, one in which journalists are both benefactors and beneficiaries of the First Amendment — protecting and relying on its freedoms to inform their communities and enable democratic participation.” Thomas’s argument against Sullivan comes in a strange context — a civil suit against Bill Cosby by one of the women who accused him of sexual assault. The accuser, Kathrine McKee, claimed that Cosby’s attorney had, at Cosby’s behest, written and leaked a letter that defamed her reputation. The lower courts held that her claim could not proceed because McKee was a public figure under Sullivan, and she could not satisfy the “actual malice” standard. Thomas did not dispute the core issue in the case — whether McKee was properly held to be a public figure. Rather, he wrote to suggest that, in a different case, the court should revisit Sullivan itself, a “policy-driven decision[] masquerading as constitutional law.” At the core of Thomas’s argument is what he claims to be the original understanding of the First Amendment — that the law of defamation was almost entirely left to state legislatures and state courts, and the First Amendment did not create any special rules for cases involving public figures. Sullivan itself, though, highlighted the widespread and contemporary consensus that the deeply controversial Sedition Act of 1798 — which criminalized criticism of the federal government — was a violation of the First Amendment. These critics of the Sedition Act were Founders themselves — James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, etc. So one can draw a straight line, as Brennan did, from hostility to the Sedition Act to the need for an actual malice standard for defamation against public figures. Thus, although Thomas may be right that “constitutional opposition to the Sedition Act... does not necessarily support a constitutional actual-malice rule in all civil libel actions brought by public figures,” it does underscore the broader point that the First Amendment protects, and has always protected, a right to criticize the government. Requiring public figures to demonstrate “actual malice” is merely the application of that right in the specific context of defamation law. To be clear, no other justice joined in Thomas’s opinion, and none of the current justices have previously expressed similar misgivings about Sullivan. Thus, Sullivan may not be in jeopardy. But it’s impossible to disentangle Thomas’s opinion from the current political moment — from a president who has repeatedly attacked the media and derided as “fake news” coverage that is accurate but unflattering, has specifically railed against libel laws and has suggested the time is ripe to “open [the laws] up” so that when the press “write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” For a justice who has been on the court for 27 years, it is therefore an especially ominous moment to publicly suggest revisiting Sullivan — and troubling evidence that Trump’s efforts to weaken public support for our current libel regime, and for the right to criticize the government it enshrines, may well be working.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/one-house-republican-jumped-join-democratic-effort-stop-donald-trumps-border-wall-national-emergency---split---Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, is leading the joint resolution of disapproval. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) About an hour before an announced deadline for original co-sponsors on a Democratic-led effort to disapprove of President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over border security, one Republican had signed on. At the same time, the measure had already gathered support from 216 members, almost all of them members of the House Democratic caucus. That’s according to the office of Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is spearheading the joint resolution. It wasn’t immediately clear which GOP lawmaker had signed on early. Castro announced his intention Feb. 14, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday night called on House members to back his effort. In a Dear Colleague letter, the California Democrat said the measure would move “swiftly” through the chamber, following the legal framework for expedited consideration under the National Emergencies Act. The Pelosi letter specified a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline for the initial round of co-sponsorships before Castro files the legislation on Friday, when the House is scheduled to meet in a pro-forma session. The law provides a path for Congress to weigh in to reject a presidential emergency declaration, but the joint resolution would need either a presidential signature or a two-thirds vote in each chamber to eventually override a Trump veto. “All Members take an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. The President’s decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated,” Pelosi wrote. “We have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and defend our system of checks and balances against the President’s assault.” The text of Castro’s resolution appears to be “clean,” meaning it should get expedited consideration in the Senate as well, where it would have a chance of passage without needing 60 votes to break a filibuster. “Historically, Presidents have declared national emergencies for urgent matters of national security. President Trump would unconstitutionally usurp congressional authority by declaring an emergency based upon unfounded hype rather than any substantive emergency,” Castro said in a statement last week, announcing his potential plan just a day before Trump actually made the declaration And the effort to stop the use of an emergency declaration to seize funds for construction of the wall at the border with Mexico should get at least some Republican support in the Senate, including from Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. “If the House passes a resolution of disapproval and it is a clean resolution, I will support that,” Collins told reporters in South Portland on Wednesday. “There have been many of my colleagues on the Republican side who are very wary of the president’s actions because they don’t want a future Democratic president reallocating funds.” Collins said is also supportive of the separate legal action being taking by 16 states to try to stop the emergency declaration, according to the Portland Press-Herald. There’s been some skepticism on both sides of the Capitol about Trump’s attempted end-run around the usual restrictions of the appropriations process. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee was perhaps most direct, but the Energy-Water subcommittee chairman was not alone. “It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses,” Alexander had said in a statement. “The Constitution gives that authority exclusively to a Congress elected by the people.” In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said that a Senate companion to the joint resolution would be coming. “If the president’s emergency declaration prevails, it will fundamentally change the balance of powers in a way our country’s founders never envisioned. That should be a serious wake up call to senators in both parties who believe in the constitutional responsibility of Congress to limit an overreaching executive,” the New York Democrat said.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/congress-to-subpoena-full-mueller-report-if-ag-barr-withholds-parts-blumenthal-says---split---Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has said Congress will subpoena the Mueller report if the Justice Department does not publicize it. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Democrats in Congress will subpoena the full report of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III if the Justice Department only discloses certain parts of it, Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Thursday. The Connecticut Democrat is a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the committee’s chairman, and has subpoena power over the Justice Department. CNN reported Wednesday that Mueller could issue a report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections as early as next week, though the special counsel’s notoriously tight-lipped office has provided no timeline for its plans. [Brett Kavanaugh could decide how redistricting is done] Newly confirmed Attorney General William Barr was noncommittal in his confirmation hearing about whether he would allow Mueller to testify before Congress, and whether he would resist a subpoena for the special counsel’s report. Blumenthal told CNN’s “New Day” that he is optimistic Graham would join Democrats in the House in subpoenaing the Mueller report. Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler of the House Judiciary Committee has said the full report should be made public. “There’ll be subpoenas from Congress, including, I hope, from the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Blumenthal said. Nadler echoed that sentiment last month. [3 Takeaways: There’s a big 2020 hue within Trump’s anti-socialism push] “If necessary, our committee will subpoena the report. If necessary, we’ll get Mueller to testify,“ the New York Democrat told CNN in January. “The American people need the information here.” Shielding most of Mueller’s report, and issuing select bits and pieces, would create the “public perception of a cover-up,” Blumenthal warned Thursday. “If William Barr believes — I think he does — that a sitting president cannot be indicted — I disagree with him — and he brings no charges that Mueller says can’t be brought, and if there are no public disclosures, the public rightly will feel that there is a cover-up,” Blumenthal said. But could the House and Senate actually enforce a subpoena of Mueller? “A Senate or House Committee may subpoena anyone. The Department of Justice may resist it,” Blumenthal clarified Thursday. What race ratings really mean and how we create them If Barr both denies lawmakers’ request to publicize the report and resists any subsequent subpoenas, that could set up a drawn-out court battle between Congress and the executive branch over the document’s disclosure. Even if the Mueller report remains shrouded in mystery for months, President Donald Trump, whose 2016 campaign faces accusations of cozying up to foreign influences including Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others, is still not in the clear. “Donald Trump’s legal exposure is far from over” despite the Mueller investigation appearing close to its end, Blumenthal said. He cited the continuing spinoff investigations in the Eastern District of Virginia and Southern District of New York. Those investigations have led to the convictions of multiple Trump campaign officials, including the president’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Though some Republicans have expressed concern about the president's executive action, none has vowed to join the Democratic effort to terminate the national emergency that's unlikely to succeed. Despite its dim prospects, the gambit still promises to produce a political spectacle. With newfound power in the House majority, Democrats are seizing the opportunity to not only attack the president on cable TV, but also to force Republicans into casting politically difficult votes. At the same time, other efforts to block the president are playing out in court. (MORE: Trump declares national emergency to get border wall funding) At least 197 Democrats have signed on as cosponsors of the one-page House resolution as of Thursday, according to a spokesperson for Rep. Joaquin Castro, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and author of the measure. According to the National Emergencies Act, any national emergency declared by the president shall terminate if there is a joint resolution terminating the emergency enacted into law or the president issues a proclamation terminating the emergency. The text of the resolution is relatively straightforward, identifying the president's proclamation and then destroying it: "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled That, pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622), the national emergency declared by the finding of the President on February 15, 2019, in Proclamation 9844 (84 Fed. Reg. 4949) is hereby terminated." Since the resolution would require Trump's signature to become law, he's likely to veto the measure instead -- in what would be the first of his presidency. There does not appear to be enough bipartisan support constituting supermajorities in both chambers to override a presidential veto, so this attempt to block the president legislatively likely would end there as legal challenges continue in court. A coalition of 16 states filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against the president and his administration to block the proclamation, arguing the declaration amounts to a misuse of executive power. The case could drag into the 2020 presidential campaign and ultimately end up at the Supreme Court. (MORE: 16 states sue Trump over emergency declaration for border wall) In a "Dear Colleague" letter sent Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Republicans and Democrats alike to support the resolution, warning the proclamation "undermines the separation of powers and Congress's power of the purse, a power exclusively reserved by the text of the Constitution to the first branch of government, the Legislative branch, a branch co-equal to the Executive." "All Members take an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution," Pelosi, D-Calif., noted. "The President's decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated. We have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and defend our system of checks and balances against the President's assault." A vote in the House could happen next week. Pelosi said the House "will move swiftly to pass this bill," reporting it out of committee within a maximum of 15 calendar days and a vote on the floor within three calendar days following that, pursuant to the statutory terms in the National Emergencies Act. While the Senate's majority is controlled by Republicans, the measure is privileged and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is compelled to hold a vote on the measure after House passage, creating an awkward vote to either buck the president or surrender the constitutional authorities many lawmakers believe are threatened by executive action. If the House passes it, the resolution could sit in committee for up to 15 days before it's considered privileged in the upper chamber and its consideration is mandated. Last week, McConnell encouraged the president to pursue executive action, though several GOP senators, including Sens. Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, Thom Tillis, Susan Collins and Lamar Alexander have expressed an aversion to the president's declaration. "The president has made a strong case for increased border security, but declaring a national emergency is unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution," Alexander, R-Tenn., warned Wednesday prior to the president's announcement on Friday. "It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses. The Constitution gives that authority exclusively to a Congress elected by the people." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that identical companion legislation to the House resolution "will soon be introduced in the Senate." "If the president's emergency declaration prevails, it will fundamentally change the balance of powers in a way our country's founders never envisioned," Schumer, D-N.Y., cautioned. "That should be a serious wake-up call to senators in both parties who believe in the constitutional responsibility of Congress to limit an overreaching executive."
---split---6.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/race-global-5g-dominance-trump-s-it-n974156---split---President Donald Trump on Thursday brought renewed national attention to what has emerged as one of the most hotly debated technological and geopolitical challenges — the race to build a next-generation 5G wireless internet network. The president used his Twitter account to broadcast the need for American companies to “step up their efforts” in establishing the 5G network “or get left behind." 5G wireless networks are expected to offer superior connectivity and data speeds, paving the way for advanced technologies such as self-driving cars. Trump also encouraged the development of 6G technology, which would conceivably offer even greater technological capabilities but remains almost entirely theoretical. Trump's tweets came just hours after CBS published an interview with Ren Zhengfei, the CEO of Chinese telecom firm Huawei, who said that his company was already in the process of rolling out 5G technology and would "soon" introduce 6G technology. Huawei has become the focus of concerns that the United States is falling behind in the development of advanced wireless technology. The U.S. is ceding ground to the Chinese firm abroad as well as domestically, where Huawei already powers at least 25 percent of the carrier member networks of the Rural Wireless Association, according to a Federal Communications Commission filing in December. I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on......... ....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! While major U.S. telecommunications companies have touted their investments in 5G technology, China's firms are by some measures a step ahead, causing concern that the U.S. could fall behind in building new technology off the next-generation networks. “The implication is that new industries of the future, the new ways of making a living, will be in China and not here. They’ll have this huge sandbox to play with and a lot of control over the market,” said Susan Crawford, author of “Fiber: The Coming Tech Revolution — and Why America Might Miss It" and a professor at Harvard Law School focusing on technology policy. By some measurements, China is outpacing the U.S. in wireless infrastructure development, with a 2018 report from accounting company Deloitte detailing the breakneck rate at which the country's wireless firms are building new cell towers. "Infrastructure spend and tower density distinguish China’s leap forward and highlight the degree to which China outpaces the United States during these early stages of 5G deployment," Deloitte wrote in the report. "China is building network site density at an unprecedented rate." Trump’s tweet is complicated by his administration's move to charge Huawei last month with money laundering, bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and conspiracy to obstruct justice, as well as the arrest in Canada of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also Zhengfei's daughter. Trump also signed a law that blocks federal government agencies from using Huawei's products after six U.S. intelligence agencies warned Americans to avoid purchasing its smartphones. The company is the world’s second largest supplier of mobile devices. The FCC is anticipated to soon pursue an outright ban on Huawei technology in the U.S. due to national security concerns. But Huawei’s founder told CBS that the company had never shared information with the Chinese government and would not give up its efforts to broaden its market appeal in the U.S. Other administration officials, however, also expressed their distrust of Huawei on Thursday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during an interview on Fox Business Network that the U.S. would not partner or share information with any countries that used Huawei’s communications technology, stating that the administration would not “put American information at risk.” “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems,” Pompeo said, referring to Huawei’s technology, “we won’t be able to share information with them. We won’t be able to work alongside them.” Pompeo said that it could affect where American embassies and military outposts are located. While the U.S., Australia and New Zealand have banned Huawei’s 5G equipment, traditional American allies such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan are considering using the company’s technology as they establish their own 5G networks, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who wrote an op-ed about the threat of Huawei on Wednesday, said a major issue is that China's 5G head start could cause the U.S. to lose the technological influence campaign over its close allies. The tense relationship that the Trump administration has developed with traditional American allies may also prove to be a roadblock in that campaign. “It’s amazing how poking your allies in the eye has a way of splashing back on you,” said Wheeler, who emphasized that a ban of Huawei in the U.S. would not be fully effective. “It’s not enough and let’s not let them break their arm patting themselves on the back. There are bigger issues that need to be raised about cybersecurity,” he said. “We have seen how malicious state actors have used our non-Huawei equipment to attack American assets. We need to think beyond the infrastructure to anticipate how we are going to deal with this.” Though the debate on the world stage might be the loudest, the dispute over Huawei and 5G can be felt in small communities in the U.S., as well. Major telecom companies that tend to serve urban communities have supported the ban of Huawei’s technology as they develop their own equipment for rollout. Smaller mobile carriers, however, note a need for the Chinese firm’s cheap technology to remain competitive and be able to afford to serve their rural customers. “There’s a lot of peeling of the onion here, but the FCC considering banning Huawei equipment will negatively impact the small carriers that don’t have the financial reach that the major carriers have,” said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy. “The sad part of this whole conversation is we’re talking about these fancy technologies that will benefit the haves, while the have-nots will continue to be left behind,” she added.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/frostpaw-polar-bear-climate-change---split---Bill Snape dons his Frostpaw outfit in Philadelphia for the 2016 Democratic convention. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) If you see a 7-foot polar bear around D.C., don’t panic. It’s probably just Frostpaw. “It’s akin to hot yoga,” said Bill Snape, who’s been donning the iconic costume for several years. “Whenever I first put it on, I have these five minutes of claustrophobia and discomfort, and then I just relax and find my breathing pattern and get into this love trance.” That’s about as heated as things get. Frostpaw has turned up at climate rallies in Washington and around the country, not to mention political conventions, agency hearings and President Donald Trump’s inauguration. But aside from a stray arrest on Wall Street in 2014, the bear has kept the mood pretty chill. “It seems silly, to dress up as a big animal,” said Snape, who shares bear duties with other employees of the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, where he works as senior counsel. “But what I discovered is that wearing this huge outfit is just a magnet. It inspires almost any person of any type to want to engage and talk.” The message is simple: If glaciers keep melting at the current pace, polar bears won’t make it to the end of the century. Or as Snape puts it, “Frostpaw is completely and utterly screwed if we don’t address climate change. The only polar bears left will be in zoos and dorks like me wearing outfits.” So why doesn’t Frostpaw make it to the Capitol more often? The bear has ventured inside for a hearing or two, but logistics make it difficult. Getting the bulky costume through security is a challenge, and Snape sees the character as primarily an educational tool rather than a lobbying one. That’s not to say the bear won’t be showing up in support of the Green New Deal. “Frostpaw’s new hero is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” according to Snape. Some climate activists have turned up the volume in the Trump era, especially after the president withdrew from the Paris climate deal and cast doubt on his administration’s finding that extreme temperatures and rising sea levels could hurt Americans. But Frostpaw has stuck to a low-key script. “I don’t go around saying, ‘Trump sucks,’ even though Frostpaw doesn’t like Trump very much. That’s not a good message,” said Snape, who also teaches classes at American University’s law school. “Frostpaw would have to turn into a very angry bear, and we’ve decided not to make that turn yet.” Instead, Snape wants people to see his bear costume and think of the future. That much, at least, doesn’t have to be partisan, he said. “Even at the Republican National Convention in 2016, after Trump had already said climate change is a ‘hoax,’ I cannot tell you the number of Republicans who’d come up and say, ‘We love you, Frostpaw. We’ll do something to save you.’” Trump: Green New Deal sounds like a ‘high school term paper that got a low mark’ Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/congress-block-big-chunk-trumps-emergency-wall-money---split---More than a third of the money President Donald Trump wants to redirect from other federal programs to build a border barrier is likely to be unavailable from the sources he identified. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images file photo) More than one-third of the money President Donald Trump wants to redirect from other federal programs to build a border barrier is likely to be unavailable from the sources he has identified. As a result, it may be difficult for the president to circumvent Congress, even if a resolution disapproving of his “emergency” moves is never enacted. Trump announced Feb. 15 that, using emergency powers, he wants to divert as much as $6.7 billion from other programs to finance the construction of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. That includes $3.6 billion from unspent military construction money, $2.5 billion in unspent Pentagon counterdrug funds and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture account. But the Defense Department has told lawmakers that only $85 million remains unspent in the counterdrug account, a House Appropriations spokesman said Thursday. The Pentagon is planning to ask Congress for authority to reprogram more than $2.4 billion from other military programs into the counterdrug account in order to then take it right back out and move it to the wall project. “The Department would need to reprogram additional funding into the account to reach the up to $2.5 billion that may be required for border security support,” said Christopher Sherwood, a Defense Department spokesman. Flashback: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge However, a reprogramming request must be approved by both Republicans and Democrats on the four authorizing and appropriating panels that oversee the Pentagon. Such approval in this case is all but certain to fail. All it would take is one chairman or ranking member to say no. On Thursday, one of those lawmakers, Indiana Democrat Peter J. Visclosky, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a statement that he would turn down any request to reprogram military money to pay for a border wall. “I am adamantly opposed to the use of any funds provided by Congress to the Department of Defense for the unauthorized construction of a wall on the Southwest border,” Visclosky said. “I and the other members of the House Appropriations Committee will carefully examine each element of the President’s proposal and the serious jurisdictional and Constitutional concerns that it raises.” The $2.5 billion comprises about 37 percent of the money Trump wants to redirect to the border initiative and away from its congressionally approved purposes. Trump could still find other ways to pay for the project against Congress’ wishes, including adding to the amount of military construction money he will tap. According to a House Appropriations Committee spreadsheet, there appears to be some billions of dollars in previously appropriated but unobligated military construction money that could be available to be redirected from the projects the military and Congress approved. The Pentagon has yet to announce which military construction projects it will tap to bankroll this year’s installment of wall money. The additional border barriers could eventually cost an estimated $25 billion. Some on Capitol Hill say they are bracing for another possibility: that the president could move money as he wishes in the Pentagon budget and just disregard the traditional requirement that a president must get congressional approval for shifting sizable amounts of money from one account to another.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/trump-runs-gop-opposition-raiding-funds-military-bases---split---Ohio Rep. Michael R. Turner is among the Republican lawmakers with a military base in their districts who opposes the president’s circumvention of congressional spending powers. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Though typically aligned with the White House, some Republicans who have military bases in their districts oppose President Donald Trump raiding $3.6 billion in military construction projects to finance walls along the southern border. Recent polling finds that most Americans oppose Trump’s circumvention of Congress to divert already-appropriated funds to build a wall, and the percentage of voters who endorse the idea tracks closely to the president's approval rating. Speaking out against Trump entails some political risk for most Republicans. So while many have groused that the national emergency declaration is legally dubious and could give the other party a similar weapon when a Democrat is in the White House, few have outright opposed the maneuver. But some in the House Republican Caucus have sounded off about the diversion of nearly half the annual budget for military construction. This pot of money often funds the “runways, piers, warehouses, barracks, schools, hospitals, child development centers, and other facilities needed to support U.S. military forces at home and overseas,” according to the Congressional Research Service. And lawmakers champion those projects as a boost to the economy outside the bases. It’s not yet clear which projects would go unfunded in order to finance the wall. [LISTEN: CQ Budget podcast — Trump ignites new budget fights by targeting Pentagon programs] Ohio Rep. Michael R. Turner supports a wall along the southern border. But the former chairman of the House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee breaks from the president’s plan to divert military funds to build it. “As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects,” Turner said in a statement . Turner’s Dayton-anchored 10th District include the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which he has called a“critical economic engine in southwest Ohio.” Turner has fiercely defended military spending, even for programs criticized for potentially fatal defects and cost overruns, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge When Texas Republican Roger Williams, whose 25th District partly encompasses Fort Hood, was asked if he supports Trump’s emergency declaration at a town hall meeting Tuesday, he answered “no.” Williams said he is concerned the wall could siphon funding meant for improvements to barracks he described as “condemned and falling down,” the Austin American-Statesman reported. “One of the things that I was able to accomplish was to get $61 million into Fort Hood so we can rebuild the barracks that literally were condemned and literally were falling down, and our kids (soldiers), many of them were sleeping on the ground, that should never happen,” Williams said. “We’ve got money for motor pools, we’ve got money for runways. All this stuff’s happening, from a selfish standpoint, and I’d hate to see a lot those dollars diverted from that.” Concerns that the emergency declaration could mean further deterioration of dilapidated military housing — which have been beleaguered by mold, lead paint and rodents under private ownership — have dominated headlines in recent days. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Saturday that housing projects would not be a target. "Acting Secretary Shanahan’s recent comments that military housing will not be touched is an important step, and Congressman Williams will continue to push the issue to make sure this is the case," a spokeswoman for Williams said Wednesday. Oregon Republican Greg Walden stated his opposition to the national emergency declaration in terms of a constitutional breach. But Walden’s district also houses the Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base. “Congress has granted the executive branch certain spending authorities. I strongly object to any president acting outside of those explicit authorities to spend money that Congress has not appropriated for specific initiatives,” Walden said in a statement Saturday.

Passel and Kristen Bialik Many immigrants who have time-limited permission to live and work in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) face an uncertain future as the White House and lawmakers from both parties wrangle over immigration policy and border security issues. Roughly 318,000 people currently have this protected status after fleeing their countries because of war, hurricanes, earthquakes or other extraordinary conditions that could make it dangerous for them to live in that country. Nearly all are expected to lose their benefits either this year or next. Federal officials have said that TPS is meant to provide temporary rather than long-term relief. The Trump administration proposed extending Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 immigrants as part of a border wall deal to end the longest government shutdown in history earlier this year. Democrats opposed the proposed plan for several reasons, including new standards and higher fees for TPS applications. The Department of Homeland Security said last year that it would not extend Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from six of the 10 nations that are now eligible. Of those six nations, five (Sudan, Nicaragua, Nepal, Haiti and El Salvador) will face TPS expirations this year. TPS for Honduras expires in 2020. Only those from South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Somalia have received TPS extensions with the possibility of future extension.

In fact, the share of Americans who say reducing the budget deficit should be a top policy priority is much lower than it was during most of Barack Obama’s presidency. In a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January, about half of Americans (48%) said reducing the budget deficit should be a top policy priority this year for the president and Congress. That was unchanged from 2018, but 24 percentage points lower than in 2013, at the start of Obama’s second term. In this year’s survey, deficit reduction ranked well behind strengthening the economy (70% said this was a top priority), reducing health care costs (69%), improving the educational system (68%) and several other policy priorities. The Office of Management and Budget projects the federal government will run a deficit of $984 billion in the current fiscal year. That would be the highest in seven years and more than double the deficit in fiscal 2015 ($438 billion).

They’re devoting more time to sleep and homework, and less time to paid work and socializing. But what has not changed are the differences between teen boys and girls in time spent on leisure, grooming, homework, housework and errands, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Overall, teens (ages 15 to 17) spend an hour a day, on average, doing homework during the school year, up from 44 minutes a day about a decade ago and 30 minutes in the mid-1990s. Teens are also getting more shut-eye than they did in the past. They are clocking an average of over nine and a half hours of sleep a night, an increase of 22 minutes compared with teens a decade ago and almost an hour more than those in the mid-1990s. Sleep patterns fluctuate quite a bit – on weekends, teens average about 11 hours, while on weekdays they typically get just over nine hours a night. (While these findings are derived from time diaries in which respondents record the amount of time they slept on the prior night, results from other types of surveys suggest teens are getting fewer hours of sleep.)

This finding comes as the foreign-born share of the U.S. population approaches a record high and as the issue of immigration is a top policy priority for many Americans. A quarter of Latinos in the U.S. say there are too many immigrants living in the country, while about half (48%) say there are the right amount and 14% say there are too few, according to the survey, conducted between July and September 2018. These numbers represent a dramatic shift from 2002 – the first time the Center asked this question – when 49% of Latinos said there were too many immigrants in the country, 37% said there were the right amount and 8% said there were too few. Latino connections to the immigrant experience are strong. Just under half of Latino adults are foreign born and another 31% are the U.S.-born children of immigrant parents, according to a Center analysis of the Current Population Survey. Today, immigrants from Latin America make up more than half of the roughly 45 million immigrants living in the country, including the majority of unauthorized immigrants.

But on these topics, British public opinion is not outside the EU mainstream, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. In fact, in a 2017 survey that asked about these issues, the views of British adults align very closely to general opinion across the EU, even though no other country has yet voted to leave. While a majority of British adults say that being born in their country and having family background from their country are important to truly share their national identity (57% and 58%, respectively), six-in-ten people across the EU also hold those views (both medians of 62%). And roughly one-third of people in both the UK and the EU would not be willing to have a Muslim family member (36% and median of 35%, respectively). Indeed, while the British frequently are near the middle of EU opinion on some topics that featured in Brexit debates, other EU countries have much higher levels of nationalist feeling and anti-religious minority sentiment. For example, roughly eight-in-ten Czechs say they would be unwilling to have a Muslim family member (79% vs. 36% in the UK). And two-thirds of Romanians agree that, “Our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others” (66% vs. 46% in the UK).

Apart from its political makeup, the new Congress differs from prior ones in other ways, including its demographics. Here are six charts that show how Congress has changed over time, using historical data from CQ Roll Call, the Brookings Institution, the Congressional Research Service and other sources. 1The current Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nonwhites – including blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – now account for 22% of Congress, including a quarter of the House and 9% of the Senate. By comparison, when the 79th Congress took office in 1945, nonwhites represented just 1% of the House and Senate. Despite this growing racial and ethnic diversity, Congress still lags the nation as a whole: The share of nonwhites in the United States is nearly double that of the country’s legislative body (39% vs. 22%). Read More → Topics: Congress, Federal Government, Demographics By John Gramlich and Kat Devlin A growing share of people around the world see U.S. power and influence as a “major threat” to their country, and these views are linked with attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the United States as a whole, according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 22 nations since 2013. A median of 45% across the surveyed nations see U.S. power and influence as a major threat, up from 38% in the same countries during Trump’s first year as president in 2017 and 25% in 2013, during the administration of Barack Obama. The long-term increase in the share of people who see American power as a threat has occurred alongside declines in the shares of people who say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs and who have a favorable view of the United States. (For more about global views toward the U.S. president and the country he leads, see “Trump’s International Ratings Remain Low, Especially Among Key Allies.”) Despite these changes, U.S. power and influence still ranks below other perceived threats around the world. Considerably larger shares of people point to global climate change (seen as a major threat by a median of 67%), the Islamic militant group known as ISIS (cited by 62%) and cyberattacks (cited by 61%). U.S. power and influence, in fact, is not seen as the top threat in any of the countries surveyed.

From cohabitation to same-sex marriage to interracial and interethnic marriage, here are eight facts about love and marriage in the United States. 1Half of Americans ages 18 and older were married in 2017, a share that has remained relatively stable in recent years but is down 8 percentage points since 1990. One factor driving this change is that Americans are staying single longer. The median age at first marriage had reached its highest point on record: 30 years for men and 28 years for women in 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As the U.S. marriage rate has declined, divorce rates have increased among older Americans. In 2015, for every 1,000 married adults ages 50 and older, 10 had divorced – up from five in 1990. Among those ages 65 and older, the divorce rate roughly tripled since 1990.

Pew Research Center released several reports in 2018 that explored the role and meaning of algorithms in people’s lives today. Here are some of the key themes that emerged from that research. 1Algorithmically generated content platforms play a prominent role in Americans’ information diets. Sizable shares of U.S. adults now get news on sites like Facebook or YouTube that use algorithms to curate the content they show to their users. A study by the Center found that 81% of YouTube users say they at least occasionally watch the videos suggested by the platform’s recommendation algorithm, and that these recommendations encourage users to watch progressively longer content as they click through the videos suggested by the site. 2The inner workings of even the most common algorithms can be confusing to users. Facebook is among the most popular social media platforms, but roughly half of Facebook users – including six-in-ten users ages 50 and older – say they do not understand how the site’s algorithmically generated news feed selects which posts to show them. And around three-quarters of Facebook users are not aware that the site automatically estimates their interests and preferences based on their online behaviors in order to deliver them targeted advertisements and other content.

These attitudes were evident in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the summer of 2018. Nigeria is home to the largest population in Africa, which is almost evenly split between Muslims and Christians. Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be running against multiple candidates including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), John Gbor of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Usman Muhammed of the Labour Party (LP) and others. Tensions in the country have grown in the final weeks before elections because of Buhari’s controversial decision to suspend the country’s chief justice.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/200-american-troops-syria_n_5c6f6577e4b00eed08327e8d---split---WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The United States will leave “a small peacekeeping group” of 200 American troops in Syria for a period of time after a U.S. pullout, the White House said on Thursday, as President Donald Trump pulled back from a complete withdrawal. Trump in December ordered a withdrawal of the 2,000 American troops in Syria, saying they had defeated Islamic State militants there, even as U.S.-backed Syrian forces continued a final push against the group’s last outpost. But Trump has been under pressure from multiple advisers to adjust his policy to ensure the protection of Kurdish forces, who supported the fight against Islamic State and who might now be threatened by Turkey, and to serve as a bulwark against Iran’s influence. “A small peacekeeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for a period of time,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. The decision was announced after Trump spoke by phone to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. A White House statement said the two leaders agreed, regarding Syria, to “continue coordinating on the creation of a potential safe zone.” A senior administration official said Trump’s decision had been in the works for some time. It was unclear how long the 200 troops would be expected to remain in the area or where exactly they would be deployed. Leaving even a small group of U.S. troops in Syria could pave the way for European allies to commit hundreds of troops to help set up and observe a potential safe zone in northeast Syria. The commander of U.S.-backed Syrian forces has called for 1,000 to 1,500 international troops to remain in the country to help fight Islamic State and expressed hope the United States, in particular, would halt plans for a total pullout. The decision to retain peacekeepers could help Trump overcome criticism that he had ordered a precipitous withdrawal from Syria that could lead to Islamic State regaining strength. “This is a clear direction to our allies and coalition members that we will be on the ground in some capacity,” the senior U.S. administration official said. Until now, European allies have balked at providing troops unless they received a firm commitment that Washington was still committed to the region. Belgian Defense Minister Didier Reynders told reporters on Thursday before a meeting with acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan that the issue of keeping troops in Syria in the future would be a matter for discussion with U.S. officials. Turkey wants to set up a safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist group. The White House did not say where exactly its troops would be based. In addition to northeast Syria, officials have talked about the importance of keeping some troops at the strategic Tanf garrison on the Iraq-Jordan border. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the initial plan was to have some troops in northeastern Syria and some at Tanf. The official said planning was ongoing and could change. The Tanf garrison was set up when Islamic State fighters controlled eastern Syria bordering Iraq. But since the militants were driven out, Tanf has assumed a role as part of a U.S. strategy to contain Iran’s military buildup. U.S. officials have told Reuters that while in Munich last week, Shanahan held a meeting on Syria with a small group of defense ministers. They talked about needing some sort of security arrangement in northeast Syria after the United States left. Shanahan will meet his Turkish counterpart on Friday. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham issued a statement applauding Trump’s decision to keep a small contingent of U.S. troops in Syria as part of an international stabilizing force, saying the president had followed sound military advice that would help avoid the problems the United States faced in Iraq.
---split---7.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-push-ahead-bid-terminate-trump-s-emergency-declaration-n974091---split---WASHINGTON — House Democrats planned to push ahead Friday with a measure that seeks to terminate President Donald Trump's emergency declaration that he issued last week in order to circumvent Congress and build his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, was set to file a joint resolution in the House that would repeal the president’s declaration. The measure was to be filed during the chamber’s pro forma session, since lawmakers are on recess and don’t return to Washington until Monday. As of Thursday, the measure had at least 222 co-sponsors, Castro said. We have 222 cosponsors to terminate President Trump’s national emergency declaration to build his border wall. #FakeTrumpEmergency pic.twitter.com/guCB4PQlK2 In a letter circulated to lawmakers of both parties, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged all members to back it, saying the president’s move “undermines the separation of powers and Congress’s power of the purse.” “The House will move swiftly to pass this bill,” Pelosi said in the letter, specifying that it would be reported out of committee within 15 calendar days and would be considered on the House floor three days after that. “The President’s decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated.” Trump declared the national emergency in a speech from the White House Rose Garden last Friday after Congress refused to allot his full funding request for an actual wall in a bipartisan government spending package. In declaring the emergency, he expected to have access to $8 billion for the wall, including the $1.375 billion in the funding package that he signed last week, $600 million in Treasury forfeiture, $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program and $3.6 billion in military construction from the Defense Department, a senior White House official said. The move has drawn bipartisan criticism, with Democrats blasting Trump and Republicans warning him that it sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, Congress has the ability to try to end an emergency status instituted by the president. Democrats in the House will have no problem passing the resolution given their 235-197 majority. Once it passes the House, the measure would be sent to the Senate, where unlike most pieces of legislation, GOP leaders could not block it from reaching the floor. The federal law requires that the Senate take up the House-passed resolution within 18 days. The resolution is considered “privileged” — which means it would not be subject to a filibuster and require 60 votes to move forward. Instead, it would simply require 51 votes to pass. If all 47 Democrats were to support the measure, they would need only four Republican defections to pass it — in a chamber that has not lacked for GOP criticism of the president's move. In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the president’s declaration represented a sharp expansion of executive power. “That's why you see an awful lot of us concerned about this,” said Johnson, who said he would hear the president out — but did not rule out voting on a resolution of disapproval in the Senate, saying he would "decide when I actually have to vote on it.” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Monday that the money Trump would be raiding from the military construction budget is needed for facilities around the country. “So I think it's a bad idea,” he told reporters at Miami International Airport. “I also think it's a bad idea because usually emergency declarations are for situations in which Congress doesn't have time to organize itself to vote on it. The Congress just had a vote on this and it just expressed itself.” A number of other GOP senators have publicly expressed skepticism or opposition to the declaration — with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, saying she would back a measure limited to disapproval of the declaration itself. “If it’s a ‘clean’ disapproval resolution, I will support it,” she said, according to the Associated Press. If both the House and Senate were to pass the resolution, it would send a major symbolic message — but its impact would be limited to symbolism: administration aides have already made clear Trump would veto any effort that interfered with his declaration, and the measure is unlikely to attract anywhere near the GOP support needed to overturn a presidential veto. So Democrats are pushing back on other fronts, looking to nullify the declaration by challenging it in court, with California, New York and 14 other states filing a lawsuit on Monday to try to block the move.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/i-don-t-know-trump-draws-blank-homosexuality-decriminalization-push-n974161---split---A day after the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration revealed his push to decriminalize homosexuality around the world, the president was caught on camera seemingly unaware of the effort. Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Tuesday that he has total support from the administration for his gay rights program focusing on 71 countries where homosexuality is still illegal. But Wednesday, a reporter asked President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, “Mr. President, on your push to decriminalize homosexuality — are you doing that? And why?” "Say it?” Trump responded. “Your push to decriminalize homosexuality across the world,” the reporter repeated. Trump responded: "I don't know, uh, which report you're talking about. We have many reports." Here's that video of @POTUS responding to a question about Ambassador @RichardGrenell's push to decriminalize homosexuality in the 70+ countries where consensual same-sex activity is illegal: "I don't know which report you're talking about. We have many reports." pic.twitter.com/EMaXtODY4U Vice President Mike Pence, on the other hand — who has long drawn criticism from gay rights advocates who argue he has supported policies that are anti-LGBTQ, such as opposing same-sex marriage and gays serving in the military — told NBC News on Wednesday that he is in support of Grenell's recently announced policy. In a briefing with reporters at the State Department on Tuesday, deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino downplayed Grenell’s new effort, describing it as “long-standing,” “bipartisan” and “really is not a big policy departure.” “I would say that this is a good opportunity to listen and to discuss ideas about how the United States can advance decriminalization of homosexuality around the world, and that’s been our policy,” Palladino said. Many LGBTQ rights groups were skeptical of Grenell's global efforts, noting that a number of the Trump administration's broader policies have attempted to roll back gay and transgender rights in the United States. “We’d believe that the Trump administration will work to protect LGBTQ people around the world if they had not attacked LGBTQ people in the U.S. over 90 times since taking office,” LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD said. The Log Cabin Republicans, one of the few right-leaning LGBTQ advocacy groups, praised Grenell's effort. “By taking this action the administration brings attention to a major human rights violation and positions the United States as the leader to end this injustice,” Jerri Ann Henry, the group's executive director, stated. Grenell was asked about some of the skepticism surrounding his initiative and the Trump administration’s record on LGBTQ rights, such as efforts to eject transgender and HIV-positive people from the military. “Save the other fights for later,” the ambassador responded.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/opinion/trump-investigation-robert-khuzami.html---split---Supported by The U.S. legal system is withstanding the Trump onslaught. By David Brooks Opinion Columnist A crucial question of the Trump years has always been: Will our institutions hold? Will the legal, political and social institutions of American life be able to withstand the norm-destroying corruption of King Chaos? The U.S. Congress has not fared well. Many Republicans have been supine while Donald Trump has shriveled congressional authority and shredded the rules of basic democratic behavior. The American legal system, however, seems to be holding up pretty well. Even under the intense Trumpian pressure my Times colleagues described earlier in the week. Robert Mueller is a solid rock in the face of waves of calumny. If anything, the investigators at the Southern District of New York seem to be picking up the pace. These investigations are being led, it should be noted, by Republicans. The S.D.N.Y. investigation seems to be zeroing in on the $107 million Trump inauguration extravaganza. From the hints dropped by the subpoenas, one gets the impression that the inauguration was a shambolic grabfest in which people with money tried to turn it into power and people who suddenly had power tried to turn it into money. Some legal experts believe the inauguration is being aggressively probed as a racketeering operation — a continuing criminal enterprise, complete with mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and the rest. So why aren’t the legal authorities wilting? One explanation: institutions and character. The legal institutions instill codes of excellence that are strong enough to take the heat. The people in authority have enough character to live up to those codes. The head of the S.D.N.Y. office is Geoffrey Berman, a Trump appointee. Berman has recused himself where that is appropriate and pushed ahead where that is appropriate. The people on his team are famously independent professionals. Let’s just pick out one, to illustrate the type: the man Berman chose to be his deputy, Robert Khuzami. Khuzami was born in Brooklyn (you can’t understand the Trump presidency without understanding the resentments and cultural geography of the New York boroughs) and raised in Rochester. According to a 2013 Times DealBook story, he was born into a bohemian family, with ballroom-dancer parents, a muralist sister and a drummer brother. They joke that Robert is the “white sheep” in the family. He began college at the State University of New York at Geneseo before transferring to the University of Rochester. He supported himself as a dishwasher, bartender and overnight dockworker. He went to Boston University law school and his career took off. Khuzami has served through three separate intense investigations. In the 1990s he was part of the team that prosecuted Omar Abdel Rahman, the “Blind Sheikh,” who led a foiled plot to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks. In 2009, in the wake of the financial crash, he was named head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, revitalizing a demoralized unit. And now he is part of a team taking on the president of the United States. In between his government service, he’s taken lucrative private sector jobs, as general counsel for Deutsche Bank and as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis. Andy McCarthy was one of Khuzami’s fellow prosecutors in the Blind Sheikh case. In his book “Willful Blindness,” McCarthy describes Khuzami as fearless, dogged and willing to contend with the thorniest knots of evidence. In an email to me, McCarthy wrote that Khuzami “is as terrific as you may suspect he is.” Over the years, Khuzami’s employees have generally described him as intimidating but likable. He was intimidating after the financial crisis. In the 2011 fiscal year, for example, the S.E.C. brought a record 735 enforcement actions. In the same year, his division collected $2.8 billion in penalties and disgorgement. His critics have often come from the left. Khuzami spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, in defense of the Patriot Act. Some argue, plausibly, that as general counsel to Deutsche Bank from 2004 to 2009, he should have been aware of the financial shenanigans of that era. Others argue that since he’s been through the revolving door between the elite firms and big government, he’s actually been soft on Wall Street bigs, charging them penalties but not actually holding them responsible. The critics may have a point. But when you look at Khuzami and the prosecutors like him, you see people who had been formed — who have been carved by institutions and experience for a moment and role like this. Khuzami is a tested professional. He’s proved his skill at the highest levels. He’s a Wall Street and legal insider. He’s seen national security, Wall Street and white-collar corruption from all angles. And he’s a patriot. He’s given up lucrative jobs to serve. The point of this is not to lionize Khuzami. He’s part of a team. There are teams like that spread anonymously throughout the U.S. government. They are clinging tenaciously to the old standards of right and wrong, to the Constitution and the rule of law. And if we get through this, it will be because of people like them.

---split---7.0---split---https://play.google.com/?hl=en---split---This program is read by the author. On March 16, 2018, just twenty-six hours before his scheduled retirement from the organization he had served with distinction for more than two decades, Andrew G. McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy." In The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution. McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime—which is inextricably linked to the Russian state—and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The Threat recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen. Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, The Threat tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America. #1 New York Times Bestseller Over 2 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. New York Times Bestseller Joining the ranks of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, You Are a Badass, and F*ck Feelings comes this refreshing, BS-free, self-empowerment guide that offers an honest, no-nonsense, tough-love approach to help you move past self-imposed limitations. Are you tired of feeling fu*ked up? If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unfu*ked version of yourself. "Wake up to the miracle you are," he directs. "Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being." It isn't other people that are standing in your way, it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive, it's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. In Unfu*k Yourself, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: Lead the life you were meant to have—Unfu*k Yourself. Simple ideas, lasting love. Between busy schedules and long days, expressing love can fall by the wayside. We forget to compliment, to give gifts "just because," to linger in an embrace. The things that say "I love you" seem to either not get said or not get through. This is an audio book about saying it - and hearing it - clearly. No gimmicks. No psychoanalyzing. Just learing to express love in your spouse's language. With over 10 million copies sold, The 5 Love Languages® has transformed countless relationships. Its ideas are simple and conveyed with clarity and humor, making this audio book as practical as it is personable. You'll be inspired by real-life stories and encouraged by its commonsense approach. Listening to this audio feels like taking a walk with a wise friend. Applying it will forever change your relationship - starting today. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie. As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore. With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be. With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, Girl, Wash Your Face shows you how to live with passion and hustle--and how to give yourself grace without giving up. West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire...not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn’t bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She’s the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England. Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past? Only the devil’s daughter knows…  Lady Evina Maclean has heard much about Rory Buchanan’s skill as a healer. What she hasn’t heard is how good the brawny Highlander looks bathing in a waterfall. But Evina can’t afford the distraction, for her ailing father urgently needs care. Only when she’s rendered Buchanan unconscious and dragged him back to her family’s castle does the truth emerge—it’s not Rory she’s kidnapped but his brother Conran. Other ladies try to ensnare Conran with flattery. Evina hits him over the head with the hilt of her sword to save her kin—and Conran likes the spirited redhead all the more for it. He’s learned enough from his brother to heal Evina’s father, but there are other dangers swirling around the Maclean clan. And while the beautiful, independent lady has sworn not to marry, this wrong Highlander may be just the right man for her. Pottermore has now launched the Wizarding World Book Club.

"The book is called Grateful American, and I promise you after you read it you will be grateful for what Gary has accomplished and contributed to our country." -- Clint Eastwood As a kid in suburban Chicago, Gary Sinise was more interested in sports and rock 'n' roll than reading or schoolwork. But when he impulsively auditioned for a school production of West Side Story, he found his purpose--or so it seemed. Within a few years Gary and a handful of friends created what became one of the most exciting and important new theater companies in America. From its humble beginnings in a suburban Chicago church basement and eventual move into the city, the Steppenwolf Theatre Company launched a series of groundbreaking productions, igniting Gary's career along with those of John Malkovich, Joan Allen, Gary Cole, Laurie Metcalf, Jeff Perry, John Mahoney, and others. Television and film came calling soon after, and Gary starred in Of Mice and Men (which he also directed) and The Stand before taking the role that would change his life in unforeseeable ways: Lieutenant Dan in the Academy Award–winning Forrest Gump. The military community's embrace of the character of the disabled veteran was matched only by the depth of Gary's realization that America's defenders had not received all the honor, respect, and gratitude their sacrifices deserve. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, this became Gary's mission. While starring in hits like Apollo 13, Ransom, Truman, George Wallace, CSI:NY, and Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, Gary has worked tirelessly on behalf of those who serve this country, entertaining more than a half million troops around the world playing bass guitar with his Lt. Dan Band, raising funds on behalf of veterans, and eventually founding the Gary Sinise Foundation with a mission to serve and honor America's defenders, veterans, first responders, their families, and those in need. Grateful American is the moving, entertaining, profoundly gripping story of how one man found his calling: to see that those who defend this country and its freedoms are never forgotten. In this science fiction epic from the author of Ender’s Game, it is 40 million years in the future, and humanity long ago abandoned Earth, rendered uninhabitable by their destructive wars. Now, mankind survives on the planet of Harmony, where the Oversoul--an artificial intelligence--protects them from their own worst impulses. There are no wars, no dangerous technologies or weapons of mass destruction. But after so many millennia, the Oversoul is beginning to fail. Now, a group of humans must return to Earth and seek advice from the entity on which the Oversoul is modeled–the mysterious Keeper of the Earth.

Sophie, a student and reluctant revolutionary, is supposed to be dead, after being exiled into the night. Saved only by forming an unusual bond with the enigmatic beasts who roam the ice, Sophie vows to stay hidden from the world, hoping she can heal. But fate has other plans--and Sophie's ensuing odyssey and the ragtag family she finds will change the entire world.

From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes a sweeping new epic fantasy series: RISE OF THE DRAGONS (KINGS AND SORCERERS—Book 1).  Kyra, 15, dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, even though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. As she struggles to understand her special skills, her mysterious inner power, she realizes she is different than the others. But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her to wonder who she really is.  When Kyra comes of age and the local lord comes to take her away, her father wants to wed her off to save her. Kyra, though, refuses, and she journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragon—and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever.  15 year old Alec, meanwhile, sacrifices for his brother, taking his place in the draft, and is carted off to The Flames, a wall of flames a hundred feet high that wards off the army of Trolls to the east. On the far side of the kingdom, Merk, a mercenary striving to leave behind his dark past, quests through the wood to become a Watcher of the Towers and help guard the Sword of Fire, the magical source of the kingdom’s power. But the Trolls want the Sword, too—and they prepare for a massive invasion that could destroy the kingdoms forever.  With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, RISE OF THE DRAGONS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, of ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders.  Book #2 in KINGS AND SORCERERS is now available!  “RISE OF THE DRAGONS succeeds—right from the start…. A superior fantasy…It begins, as it should, with one protagonist's struggles and moves neatly into a wider circle of knights, dragons, magic and monsters, and destiny.…All the trappings of high fantasy are here, from soldiers and battles to confrontations with self….A recommended winner for any who enjoy epic fantasy writing fueled by powerful, believable young adult protagonists.” --Midwest Book Review, D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer Alan W. Watts, renowned for his interpretations of Eastern philosophy for Western audiences, shares timeless principles that have benefitted generations seeking serenity from life’s uncontrollable circumstances in The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety. When we spend our emotional energy reliving the past and worrying about the future, we lose the only moments we truly have in the here and now. Drawing from Eastern thought and religion, Watts reveals that the secret to living a fulfilling life is to live for today. Our quest to achieve a completely stable and secure environment is fueling our anxieties. Only by acknowledging the truth—that we cannot predict tomorrow’s events and outcomes—will enable us find and cherish our joys in the present. "Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the unwritable.'"—Los Angeles Times

Eric Swalwell has been one of President Donald Trump’s top antagonists. (Rep. Eric Swalwell via Twitter) Rep. Eric Swalwell faced a dilemma Wednesday afternoon. As he trudged past Trump Tower, he wondered where else he could get a good cup of coffee in Manhattan. “It’s snowing in [New York]. I need coffee. The closest cafe is inside Trump Tower. This is me walking to an alternative,” Swalwell tweeted. There are a lot of alternatives. It’s snowing in #NewYork. I need coffee. The closest cafe is inside Trump Tower. This is me walking to an alternative. pic.twitter.com/RLb0tAy2yT  In his roles on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, Swalwell has become a leading antagonist of the Trump administration on alleged collusion between the campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. The former county prosecutor makes frequent appearances on cable news to discuss the subject. Swalwell’s tweet received more than 32,000 replies as of Thursday morning, many from supporters of President Donald Trump taunting the California Democrat for his faux bravery. Conservative media personality Laura Ingraham seized the opportunity to mock him. Since you’ve been operating in “alternative” universe for years, this should be easy for you. (Try the Russian Tea Room—maybe you’ll finally find your collusion.) https://t.co/GB2YM2TGOT  Swalwell hopes to leverage his amplified profile into a presidential run, and has all but confirmed his plans, which has made him a target of pre-emptive attacks from the right. “I’m getting pretty close,” Swalwell said in a CNN interview last week. “We got a team down in Iowa. I see all green lights ahead. I’m encouraged because I think the country wants someone who is going to go big, go bold, and do good. I’m excited to offer that vision.” Presumably he’ll have a campaign team that will advise him against trying to make a statement like Wednesday’s. pic.twitter.com/JtJQWjSrjd   Where will you possibly find coffee in New York City? pic.twitter.com/kcecq5dcSx   Live feed of Swalwell crossing the street for anti-Trump coffee pic.twitter.com/k7YaC8WagN  Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/trump-shouldnt-plan-tweet-from-6g-phone-soon/---split---It's been a big week for 5G, the next generation of wireless networks. Samsung announced its first 5G capable phone, the S10, on Wednesday. Qualcomm announced a new 5G modem on Tuesday. But President Trump is aiming higher. "I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible," Trump wrote in a tweet urging carriers to pick up their pace. "It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard." https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1098581869233344512 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1098583029713420288 Trump won’t see anything called 6G during his presidency, even if he wins reelection next year. The 3GPP, the organization responsible for standardizing wireless network technologies, started work on the 5G standard in 2011 and hasn't completely finalized it yet. No group has even begun work on a 6G standard. It will likely be a decade or more before anything labeled 6G arrives. According to a report commissioned by wireless industry group CTIA, the US lags China and South Korea in readiness for 5G. There are a number of reasons for this, including a need for the Federal Communications Commission to free up more wireless spectrum for 5G use, as well as more fiber-optic connections to handle the "backhaul" between cellular towers. But so far no country has a nationwide 5G network. Still, some researchers are already hard at work on one technology that could underpin 6G: terahertz wireless. “I’m glad he [Trump] is talking about it,” says Theodore Rappaport, director of New York University's NYU Wireless program. “It’s time to start talking about what 6G will be.” 5G isn't just one technology or standard but, rather, a constellation of different technologies. The 5G technology that has captured the most attention is called millimeter wave. Millimeter wave refers to the portion of the wireless spectrum above around 24 GHz where there's plenty of unused bandwidth that could help carriers deliver wireless speeds as fast, or eventually much faster, than home broadband services provide today. Terahertz wireless, which is a bit of a misnomer, technically refers to anything between 30 GHz and 3 THz. But the term is typically used to refer to anything above 100 GHz, explains Sundeep Rangan, associate director of the NYU Wireless program. Rangan and his colleagues want to make it possible to tap into the enormous amount of bandwidth that would be available at these very high frequencies, which are not widely used today. On Thursday, the FCC announced a proposal to open a huge amount of spectrum above 95 GHz for experimental use. The upshot, Rappaport says, is that terahertz frequencies could be just as fast as wired connections, meaning that wireless connections could be used for backhaul instead of fiber-optic connections. Rangan can't say for sure that the 3GPP will include terahertz wireless as part of an eventual 6G specification, but says it's a major focus for industry research. "All the machinations are moving towards this eventually being part of 6G," he says. In addition to 6G wireless networks, terahertz frequencies might be useful in radar systems for autonomous vehicles. Radars measure the distance of objects by sending out radio waves and measuring how long they take to bounce back. Today's radars aren't great at determining the exact position of an object, Rangan explains, so self-driving car systems now tend to use lidar, which uses lasers instead of radio waves to provide more precision. But radars using terahertz radio waves might work as well as lidar systems, and better in foggy conditions, while costing less. But Rangan says commercial applications of terahertz frequencies are still a good 10 years away. Millimeter wave signals have very short wavelengths, and so have trouble passing through barriers like people, walls, or trees. Terahertz waves are even shorter, and so those problems are even worse. Terahertz wireless hardware will also likely be quite power hungry. Rangan and his team are working to design circuitry for use with terahertz frequencies, with a focus on energy efficiency. Other researchers at NYU Wireless are focused on improving the reliability of terahertz transmissions. Meanwhile, companies like Samsung have joined NYU Wireless's industrial affiliate program. Rappaport says the shift from 5G to 6G could happen more quickly than the shift to 5G, because carriers will have installed much of the necessary infrastructure, such as a shift from large cell towers to “microcells.” But it will still take years to develop all the technologies necessary to make 6G a reality. Even the combined efforts of academia and industry won’t allow Trump to tweet on a 6G phone anytime soon. 5G is the next generation of high-speed wireless communication. It should speed up your phone's data service to the point that it's bonkers fast. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/morning-briefing/dems-fight-back-smollett-s-tale-unravels-big-bee-morning-n974431---split---Good morning, NBC News readers. Democrats in Congress are trying to stop Trump's national emergency, Jussie Smollett's alleged scheme unravels in detail, and researchers discover a really, really big bee. Here's everything we're watching today. President Donald Trump's emergency declaration to fund his border wall drew bipartisan criticism, with some fearing it set dangerous precedent expanding presidential power. House Democrats plan to push ahead with a measure Friday that seeks to terminate the declaration. Given the Dems' majority, it will likely pass the House. Republicans won't be able to block it from reaching the Senate floor, and just four defections may be enough to pass it there too. In the end it may all be symbolic: Administration aides say Trump will veto any effort to interfere with his declaration. That's not all Dems are up in arms about. Lawmakers have accused Trump of keeping Congress in the dark about denuclearization talks with North Korea. The president is prepping for a second summit with Kim Jong Un next week. A Coast Guard lieutenant described as a white nationalist "domestic terrorist" has been denied bail for at least two weeks. Christopher Paul Hasson is accused of plotting to kill prominent journalists and Democratic politicians. He was arrested on drug and gun charges but prosecutors say that's "just the tip of the iceberg." They've since filed court papers claiming Hasson intended "to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country." Detectives never fully bought Jussie Smollett's story that he was the victim of a hate crime. That's according to Chicago police, who gave a detailed account Thursday of how they picked apart the actor's tale that's landed him with a felony charge. Officials allege Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack in which they yelled homophobic and racist slurs, beat him and looped a noose around his neck. How did cops crack the case? "Old fashioned police work," Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. "When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off." In 2008, financier Jeffrey Epstein signed a plea agreement to halt a sex-abuse investigation involving more than 30 teenage girls. Instead of a possible lifetime sentence, he served 13 months and paid settlements to victims. A judge ruled Thursday that this was illegal because the prosecutors — led by Alex Acosta, now Trump's secretary of labor — did not tell the victims first. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone is banned from speaking publicly about his legal case after posting an Instagram image of a crosshair near the head of the judge overseeing it. Stone faces seven charges arising from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. "Publicity cannot subside if it's the defendant that's fanning the flames," U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. See more of the most compelling images from past week.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/opinion/mueller-report-trump-democrats-barr.html---split---Supported by A concise report will probably act as a “road map” to investigation for the Democratic House — and to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. By Neal K. Katyal Mr. Katyal was an acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama. The special counsel Robert Mueller will apparently soon turn in a report to the new attorney general, William Barr. Sure, there is still a lot of activity, including subpoenas, flying around, but that shouldn’t stop Mr. Mueller. The report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite. For months, the president’s lawyers have tried to discredit Mr. Mueller and this report, but their efforts may have backfired. A concise Mueller report might act as a “road map” to investigation for the Democratic House of Representatives — and it might also lead to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. A short Mueller report would mark the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end. The report is unlikely to be lengthy by design: The special counsel regulations, which I had the privilege of drafting in 1999, envision a report that is concise, “a summary” of what he found. And Mr. Mueller’s mandate is limited: to look into criminal activity and counterintelligence matters surrounding Russia and the 2016 election, as well as any obstruction of justice relating to those investigations. The regulations require the attorney general to give Congress a report, too. The regulations speak of the need for public confidence in the administration of justice and even have a provision for public release of the attorney general’s report. In a world where Mr. Mueller was the only investigator, the pressure for a comprehensive report to the public would be overwhelming. This is where the “witch hunt” attacks on Mr. Mueller may have backfired. For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller’s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump’s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors. Had Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump’s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump’s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone). Sure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail. But it is also quite possible — and more likely — to think that the president’s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack. The House of Representatives has already begun its investigation. To understand the dangers Mr. Trump may face in the aftermath of a limited Mueller report, consider the request Congress made in 1974 to the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski as it opened an impeachment inquiry. Mr. Jaworski is analogous to Mr. Mueller — indeed, his appointment was a model for the special counsel regulations. In March 1974, Peter Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote to Mr. Jaworski, requesting all information he had uncovered in his investigation. Mr. Rodino understood that Mr. Jaworski’s mandate was far more limited than the House’s, and his letter stated that “it would be unthinkable if this material were kept from the House of Representatives in the course of the discharge of its most awesome constitutional responsibility.” Of course, there is no open impeachment inquiry now. But that could quickly change if Mr. Mueller writes a report that is anything less than a full clearing of the president: Congress would be under a constitutional obligation to investigate the facts for itself. Congress cannot be satisfied that impeachable offenses were not committed when Mr. Mueller’s investigative mandate did not cover many impeachable offenses, and when his report does not provide detailed information and answers to the few offenses that are within his mandate. This is where Mr. Mueller’s “by the book” behavior may be initially unsatisfying to Mr. Trump’s critics but ultimately more threatening to the president in the long run. The overlapping investigations by different entities, housed in different branches of government, spanning geography and even different governments (such as the New York attorney general’s investigation into the Trump Foundation), make it difficult for anyone, even Attorney General Barr, to end the inquiries. This news may be disappointing, for various reasons, to the president’s critics and supporters alike. But the ultimate result is a good one. It means the truth is likely to come out — maybe not on the timetable anyone wants, but it will. So whenever Mr. Mueller turns in his report, do not assume that things are over. Like “The king is dead, long live the King,” the investigations here serve a purpose that transcends any one individual or law enforcement entity. This is the architecture of our Constitution, which is designed to ferret out high-level wrongdoing through a variety of channels for the American public to see. Neal K.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/gonzales/initial-2020-house-ratings-filled-opportunities-vulnerabilities---split---Reps. Max Rose of New York, second from left, and Joe Cunnigham of South Carolina, second from right, here with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the State of the Union, are among 31 Democrats holding seats the president carried in 2016. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) After losing a net of 40 House seats in last year’s midterms, Republicans have plenty of offensive opportunities in 2020. But winning back the majority will not be easy. On paper, the path back to 218 may look simple for Team GOP because it winds through favorable territory. There are 31 Democrats who currently represent districts that President Donald Trump carried in 2016, and Republicans need to gain 18 or 19 seats to regain House control (depending on the outcome in North Carolina’s 9th District). But the initial battleground of competitive races is mixed. Our first ratings from Inside Elections find 39 vulnerable Democratic seats and 29 vulnerable Republican ones. View Roll Call’s 2020 Election Guide to view all of our ratings for the House and Senate. Watch: What race ratings really mean and how we create them Democrats are targeting suburban districts that saw closer-than-expected races last fall, and there’s no guarantee Trump will carry the same marginal seats he did in 2016. Republicans are also running against history. The GOP has gained House seats in just one of the last six presidential elections — in 2004, when President George W. Bush’s job approval rating was about 10 points better than where Trump’s is now. And a similar 3-seat pickup wouldn’t be enough for a majority this time. Republicans have gained 18 House seats or more in just one presidential election in the last 50 years. They picked up 34 seats in 1980 but still remained in the minority because their numbers were so depressed coming into that election. [Also watch: First 2020 Senate race ratings are here] Democrats will be looking for a repeat of 2008, when they gained 20 seats in a presidential cycle on the heels of a 31-seat pickup in the preceding midterms. But that won’t be easy considering they won much of the low-hanging fruit in 2018, and Republicans in districts Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 are down to just three — New York’s John Katko, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick and Texas’ Will Hurd. It’s certainly possible the GOP bounces back by winning in districts where they lost close races last year. But some of those seats, especially suburban ones, are probably gone, at least while Trump remains at the helm of the Republican Party. For example, Democrats knocked off strong GOP incumbents Erik Paulsen (Minnesota’s 3rd), Barbara Comstock (Virginia’s 10th), Mike Coffman (Colorado’s 6th) and Carlos Curbelo (Florida’s 26th) in November. Ahead of 2020, their districts aren’t even on our initial list of competitive seats. Open seats that Republicans lost last fall — including Florida’s 27th, Washington’s 8th and California’s 49th — are also rated Solid Democratic for now, based on how poorly Trump performed in those districts in 2016. Of course, Republicans will have a second chance at districts where Trump is more popular. Our initial ratings show Joe Cunningham (South Carolina’s 1st), Kendra Horn (Oklahoma’s 5th), Ben McAdams (Utah’s 4th), Anthony Brindisi (New York’s 22nd), Max Rose (New York’s 11th), Lauren Underwood (Illinois’ 14th) and Cindy Axne (Iowa’s 3rd) all in Toss-up races. But the GOP will need to win virtually all of those seats to have a chance at the majority. Whether it’s in those districts or elsewhere, Republicans’ success will depend on their ability to follow the Democrats’ blueprint from 2018 by recruiting their own crop of political newcomers who don’t have legislative records that could be mined for attack ads. Democrats’ ability to maintain the majority will depend, in part, on new members being able to defend two years of House votes after previously running as blank slates. Even though Democrats are on defense in a majority of competitive seats, they might have the most powerful weapon: Trump. He is unifying and energizing Democratic donors and voters better than any Democrat could. And if independents vote in 2020 like they did last year, Trump could make it difficult to win back GOP seats lost and endanger even more Republican incumbents. But Republicans are banking on a fundamentally different election next year. Instead of a referendum on the president, like it was last year, the GOP will frame 2020 as a “choice” election against a Democratic Party of socialism, abortion bills and the Green New Deal. It’s too early to project the focus and mood of the electorate 21 months from now. But it’s almost certain that 2020 will be an exciting cycle, complete with fights for the House, Senate and president. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/russians-targeted-reagan-presidential-campaign-heres-cia-stop-100048764.html---split---Beginning in 1975, a big black limousine with diplomatic plates would pull up once a month to the no-parking zone outside John Greenagel’s office in the handsome Merchants Exchange Building in downtown San Francisco. A man would exit the car, paper bag in hand, and ascend the stairs to Greenagel’s public relations firm. The man would hand Greenagel, then in his mid-30s, the paper bag, which always contained stale Cuban cigars and a bottle of Stolichnaya without a tax stamp. “Compliments of Mr. Pavlov,” the man would say, and walk out. Yuri Pavlov was a diplomat based at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco and an undercover KGB officer, but the KGB probably wouldn’t have been pleased about who ended up partaking in these delectables. Because after the Soviet bag man left, Greenagel would call his CIA handler, who would pop over to his office; and they’d laugh and drink the Stoly, smoke the old Cubans and talk about Greenagel’s deepening friendship with Pavlov, which was entirely manufactured. Greenagel was acting as an “access agent” — providing the CIA with key insights about Pavlov’s psychological and personality profile. Once foreign spies like Pavlov rotate abroad, information gleaned by access agents like Greenagel can help CIA officers sharpen their strategy for recruiting them. Access agents can also facilitate introductions between the intelligence target and other CIA operatives in a seemingly natural manner. Plus, in the case of spies like Pavlov, the precious hours spent with someone like Greenagel is time that foreign intelligence officer isn’t conducting espionage elsewhere. Access agents create opportunity costs. The CIA is generally conceived to operate primarily abroad, but this, one former counterintelligence official put it, is a “fantasy.” The domestic operational arm of the CIA, known today as the National Resources (NR) Division, maintains warm ties with industry leaders in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Wall Street and beyond; voluntarily debriefs business people, scientists and other U.S. citizens returning from trips abroad; and tries to recruit foreign nationals on American soil, such as student visa holders, to work for the U.S. government. (Current CIA Director Gina Haspel previously served as deputy director for the NR Division.) But the full breadth of the agency’s stateside operations remains opaque. Recently declassified government documents laying out the permitted scope of domestic activities are heavily redacted; the CIA refuses even to confirm basic details about staffing or the National Resources Division’s number of offices across the country. (A 2013 report in Newsweek put the number of offices nationwide at about a dozen.) Nor is Greenagel’s story unique, say former U.S. intelligence officials: The CIA has long facilitated false intimacies between U.S.-based persons and intelligence targets like Pavlov on American soil. Though imbued with a distinctly Cold War flavor, Greenagel’s tale offers a rare window into CIA activities within the United States — and even more important, highlights an enduring, and newly relevant, feature of Russian espionage: an acute interest in gathering intelligence on U.S. political campaigns. Greenagal’s recruitment by the CIA was targeted: He was a first-generation, dyed-in-the-wool Reaganite, an early, well-connected figure in Ronald Reagan’s insurgent bid to wrestle the 1976 Republican nomination from incumbent President Gerald Ford. Once the CIA placed him near Yuri Pavlov, it was like a moth to the flame. KGB officers like Pavlov “wanted to learn about the American political system, and what people were thinking at the time,” notes Rick Smith, a longtime former San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence agent. “Just like what [the Russians] are doing now with Trump.” San Francisco by the mid-1970s had established itself as a countercultural mecca, the capital of American leftism; it was the incubator for the anti-Vietnam War, free speech and black power movements — a roiling cultural and political admixture. Reagan rose to the California governorship, in no small part, as a counter-reaction to this perceived Bay Area babel. Greenagel had developed a solid pedigree in California conservative politics. He was state chairman of the Youth for Goldwater campaign in 1964, had volunteered for then-Gov. Reagan’s reelection campaign in the late 1960s and later led a successful campaign on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce to defeat a statewide ballot measure the organization deemed anti-business. After working for the chamber, Greenagel founded his own one-man public relations firm. Business was uneven. “I had more time on my hands than I would have liked,” he recalls. Reagan, who left the governorship in early 1975, was mounting an audacious primary challenge to Ford for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination; and Greenagel — a supporter of Reagan’s forceful anticommunism and opposed to Ford’s policy of détente — enthusiastically volunteered, again, to work for the Reagan camp. Greenagel was an archetypical “solid citizen,” a member of a now moribund — but once mighty — California political tribe most often associated with suburban Orange County, which helped define modern right-wing U.S. politics, twice propelling Reagan to the White House. The CIA in the 1970s was also being buffeted by change. A series of scandals, including revelations about a massive illegal domestic CIA spying program, led to Congress’s establishment in 1975 of the Church and Pike Committees (the forerunners to today’s Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively), which scrutinized past intelligence community misdeeds. And those misdeeds were audacious. The congressional committees revealed CIA assassination plots targeting foreign leaders; experiments with mind control, which involved the unwitting dosage of human subjects with LSD; and a secret biological weapons program. Public faith in the nation’s spies was at a historic low. This was the unsettled, and unsettling, backdrop to the phone call Greenagel received one day in 1975. Dick Miller, an executive at PG&E, the powerful local electric utility, was on the other line. The two men were friendly and knew each other through earlier shared work at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. At the time, Miller also served on the San Francisco Police Commission, which liaised with the CIA and FBI. Miller asked Greenagel his opinion of the agency, and Greenagel expressed support for its mission. Miller told Greenagel he had a friend named “Steve Orwell,” a San Francisco-based CIA officer, who happened to be interested in speaking with him. Greenagel, intrigued, agreed to continue the conversation. A few days later, Greenagel received a call from Orwell, who recommended they meet for lunch at the Redwood Room, a landmark art deco cocktail bar downtown. Orwell told Greenagel he’d be wearing a blue suit and yellow tie. At the Redwood Room, Orwell explained to Greenagel what the CIA had in mind for him. The Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, which had opened in 1973, was a hotbed of spy activity focused on California, and Yuri Pavlov, a diplomat-cum-KGB officer, was aggressively trying to develop relationships with individuals associated with the Reagan camp. The Soviets saw Reagan as a dangerous hardliner who opposed the ratcheting-down of tensions pursued by Nixon and Ford. The Soviets were also concerned about the charismatic former actor’s growing cachet. Orwell said that “the Reagan announcement had sent all kinds of tremors through the consulate,” recalls Greenagel. The problem was that Pavlov wasn’t actually making many inroads. Orwell told Greenagel that at diplomatic functions and cocktail parties Pavlov “would start talking with somebody that may have had a connection to the Reagan campaign, and typically the guy would say, ‘Fuck yourself,’ so they wanted somebody who was willing to be nice. And Greenagel said, ‘Hell, if I met some Russian guy who wanted to talk about Reagan, that probably would have been my reaction.’” Orwell told Greenagel that he had an ideal background for work with the agency. Greenagel was self-employed — with no prying boss or colleagues — and he could keep his own hours. There were a few logistical issues — beyond, of course, the standard background check. First, Greenagel had no official role in the Reagan campaign; he was a strictly a volunteer. No problem, said Orwell: he would contact Lyn Nofziger, then the Reagan campaign press secretary (and later an adviser within the Reagan White House), explain the situation and make sure that Greenagel would be given cover. In the dark-paneled elegance of the Redwood Room, a setting fit for a spy novel, Orwell had just one last question for Greenagel: “’Would you be willing to help? We just want a guy who will become friends with him.’” Greenagel said yes. Yuri Pavlov, a slender, athletic man, was something of a sensitive soul. The CIA had intelligence that Pavlov — who like Greenagel was in his mid-30s — was disturbed by the nepotism in Soviet society. His wife had inherited a factory position from her father, a Communist Party official, and Pavlov felt stymied in his work. It was a point of pride for Pavlov that, stationed in the United States, for the first time in his career he was earning more than his wife. Bill Kinane, a former longtime FBI counterintelligence agent based in San Francisco, says that, though Pavlov posed as Soviet diplomat, he was in fact a KGB “Line PR” officer — that is, focused on political intelligence. Those KGB officers were in the United States to collect intelligence from Americans. “They had cover, but they were out there — talking to as many people as they could talk to,” says Smith, who also worked Soviet counterintelligence in San Francisco during this time. Pavlov was an easygoing and handsome man, with strong English skills. Outgoing by nature, he was a frequent presence at prominent local private organizations like the Commonwealth Club and World Affairs Council, sidling up to government officials at talks. “Pavlov was very active, very good, very sophisticated,” recalls Smith. “He had a lot of good contacts. And we kept a real close eye on him.” Pavlov also “worked the campus at Berkeley,” say Kinane. The KGB officer attended lectures, keeping an eye on Soviet students studying there and targeting professors who might wind up one day in Washington. Pavlov also hung out at bars in Berkeley popular with left-wing clientele, especially international students who might rise to prominence one day in their own countries. He would try to elicit sympathy at Berkeley for the Soviet perspective. “The Russians realized that if Democrats won, Berkeley professors would be joining [an incoming presidential] administration,” recalls Kinane, “and if Republicans won, Stanford folks would.” Pavlov was active in both circles, says Kinane, and he also built relationships with Silicon Valley executives who were fundraisers for both parties. The FBI knew all this because, at the time, the KGB was “riddled” with agents working for the United States, according to Kinane, who would receive intelligence detailing reports Pavlov was submitting about his progress in the Bay Area. “All of these KGB guys were under pressure to develop sources and assets,” he says, and as a result they tended to exaggerate their connections and lie about their development of American agents, a sort of spy’s version of résumé inflation. Those reports, in turn, would end up back with the CIA, which would then call the FBI and say, “‘This person is a KGB source,’ and we’d say, ‘No.’ But it would cause problems for innocent Americans,” Kinane says. “We were getting all this stuff about sourcing and half of it was bullshit. KGB officers would read something in the paper and say that they were told it. Not Pavlov, though.” Pavlov, it turns out, was an honest KGB officer who sought out real American sources, and now the CIA needed to make sure Greenagel would be one of those sources. The challenge, however, was to initiate contact between Greenagal and Pavlov in a natural, unforced manner. Orwell, the CIA officer, had a plan. A few days after their meeting in the Redwood Room, Orwell called Greenagel with good news — Nofzinger had readily agreed to the CIA’s request. If anyone inquired, Greenagel’s role in the Reagan for President campaign would be “special adviser.” Now, the thing to do was broker an introduction. Orwell told Greenagel that Pavlov would soon be attending a party at the home of retired Gen. Elvy Roberts — the former commander of the Presidio in San Francisco — in the tony suburb of Tiburon. This was their chance, and Orwell told Greenagel to plan on attending the party. Roberts, Orwell explained, would feign prior intimacy with Greenagel, even though the two men had never met. Roberts would then facilitate an introduction to Pavlov. It worked. Roberts opened the door to his house, recalls Greenagel, and greeted him like an old friend. “‘Oh, John, we’re so glad you’re here,’ he said. ‘There’s a guy who is anxious to meet you.’ Then he took me over to Pavlov.” Pavlov was, unsurprisingly, acutely interested in Greenagel’s work with the Reagan campaign, so they exchanged business cards and agreed to meet soon. Not long after, Pavlov, as expected, contacted Greenagel and invited him to meet up for lunch. Over the meal, Pavlov peppered Greenagel with questions about the former California governor. “He asked, ‘Is Reagan a warmonger? Why does he want military superiority? Why doesn’t he support détente?’” recalls Greenagel. An unlikely friendship — of sorts — blossomed; soon they were seeing each other socially on a regular basis, usually over drinks or meals. The two men — the staunch Reaganite and Soviet spy — would drive over the Golden Gate Bridge together for boozy outings in Sausalito. Pavlov, who had a weakness for Johnnie Walker Black, would partake in ideological debates about the merits of communism and capitalism, and engage in more mundane talk about their personal and professional lives, including about Pavlov’s boss — that is, Soviet Consul General Alexander Zinchuk. But Greenagel had a leg up. In fact, he already knew about Pavlov’s workplace gripes before Pavlov ever once confided in him, because Orwell had extensively briefed him about what the CIA already knew. Over the course of their friendship, Pavlov confided these and other details to Greenagel, which Greenagel then dutifully passed on to the CIA, often corroborating its prior information on Pavlov. Orwell had only a few rules for Greenagel: First, he was to discourage Pavlov from defecting, if the Russian expressed interest in doing so. The CIA wanted “agents in place” — that is, active KGB officers, who generally had access to more and better intelligence than defectors. He was also to encourage Pavlov to break the rules governing the activities of Soviet diplomats, such as those regarding local travel (the movements of Soviet diplomats were heavily circumscribed under U.S. law). Finally, Orwell encouraged Greenagel to ply Pavlov with expensive gifts, such as a suit. (This was probably aimed a potentially compromising Pavlov down the road; if the CIA ever approached Pavlov and revealed he had accepted gifts from an agency asset, he might then be induced to work for CIA rather than face the wrath of the KGB.) Occasionally, Orwell would hand Greenagel $100 bills to cover his expenses for his outings with Pavlov; Greenagel would sign the receipts using his mother’s maiden name. It was worth the time and expense. Pavlov, Orwell told Greenagel, was someone the agency was “particularly interested” in trying to recruit. The CIA believed that Pavlov was someone who believed he could make a difference in the world — what the CIA profilers referred to as a “messianic complex.” Yuri Pavlov wasn’t of interest just to the CIA. The FBI was following him closely too. He was, in fact, one of the “main cases” Kinane, the former FBI counterintelligence agent, was assigned during the mid-1970s. One of the great ironies, however, was that neither Kinane, nor Smith, the other FBI officer who worked Soviet counterintelligence in San Francisco at the time, recalled that the CIA had recruited Greenagel as an agent. It may seem surprising that FBI agents like Kinane and Smith could know so much about a Soviet spy like Pavlov and yet be ignorant of Greenagel’s work with the CIA, but it’s not. While the CIA and FBI can and do work well together, the counterintelligence world has often been wracked by tensions between the two agencies. FBI agents often bristle at the CIA’s perceived flouting of rules governing their domestic activities. Today, Executive Order 12333, a 1981 document, lays out the roles and responsibilities of both agencies in broad terms. The order, last updated in 2008, affirms the FBI as the lead agency for counterintelligence and foreign intelligence collection on U.S. soil. The bureau’s primacy is underlined by its search, seizure and arrest powers. The CIA can conduct clandestine foreign intelligence gathering in the United States, but must generally coordinate with the FBI — and this is a major point of friction. The CIA is forbidden to perform “internal security” or law enforcement functions domestically. It also cannot conduct electronic surveillance, searches of “U.S persons” (that is, citizens or legal permanent residents), or physical surveillance of U.S. persons (except for current or former CIA employees or contractors) on U.S. soil. And it cannot target the domestic activities of U.S. persons for foreign intelligence purposes. The CIA can, however, go undercover domestically when approaching non-U.S. persons. And crucially, it can collect foreign intelligence from “witting and voluntary” citizens and legal permanent residents on American soil, like Greenagel, who are aware they are working with the CIA and are doing so freely. It also sometimes tasks these individuals to commit espionage abroad — part of “a volunteer force of citizen-spies who roamed the world,” as Harry Crumpton, the former NR Division chief, writes in his memoir, “The Art of Intelligence.” But, as is often the case with the intelligence world, the devil is in the details — and the details are secret. A raft of documents recently declassified after an ACLU-led court battle reveals just how little the public knows. Entire pages delineating the rules governing the CIA’s activities in the United States are redacted, as are big swaths of another key document — a 2005 CIA-FBI “memorandum of understanding” that lays out the specific procedure for intelligence coordination and cooperation between the two agencies. Sometimes, “understanding” between the FBI and CIA on counterintelligence has run at a deficit. It was a “constant battle with the agency,” recalls Smith, the former FBI counterintelligence agent. “We’re trying to do the same thing. It causes problems.” Often, FBI counterintelligence felt like the CIA was muscling into its territory, disrupting delicate FBI operations already in progress. Although the two agencies could coordinate effectively, recalls Smith, there were FBI agents in San Francisco who simply refused to work with their CIA counterparts. While the CIA-FBI relationship has evolved significantly since the Cold War — and especially post-9/11 — serious tensions have endured to the present, say half a dozen former intelligence officials from both agencies, who requested anonymity in order to speak more candidly on the subject. In some corners of the FBI, there is a deep strain of skepticism, edging on outright hostility, regarding the CIA that is rooted as much in cultural differences as bureaucratic rivalries. A major sticking point between the two agencies is the requirement that the CIA coordinate its clandestine domestic activities with the FBI. Often, say multiple former counterintelligence officials, CIA officers will request making an approach on a target, or someone with access to that person. The FBI will decline, citing current operations already underway. The CIA will go around their backs and contact the person anyway. In once case, recalled a former FBI counterintelligence official, a CIA officer asked whether he could make an approach to an American citizen connected to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory — which helps design and maintain the U.S.’s nuclear arsenal — with connections to Russians of intelligence interest. After the FBI agent said no, the CIA officer went ahead and approached the person anyway, representing himself as a “consultant,” in violation of rules requiring that CIA officers disclosure their identity to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. Sometimes, say multiple former counterintelligence officials, undercover CIA officers have been caught by FBI surveillance — or even on FISA warrants — making these approaches. Things can get heated. “I’ve had agents say, ‘I’m going to go out and fucking arrest that guy’” — a CIA officer caught on FBI surveillance around 2010 — “‘for interfering with our investigation and not declaring themselves the way they’re supposed to,’” recalls a former senior counterintelligence official. “And I’m like, ‘Hold on,’ let’s not get this shit out in the streets. It happens all the time.” The CIA “treated us like a hostile intelligence service,” said another former senior counterintelligence official. While there is no evidence that Greenagel’s work on behalf of the CIA ever ran crosswise of the FBI, it does raise the question of why the bureau, which was keeping close tabs on Pavlov and his outreach to the Reagan camp, never came across Greenagel. Greenagel believes that the FBI had some role in conducting his background check. But he never had a single interaction with the bureau, nor did his CIA handler tell him if local FBI counterintelligence was aware he was working for the agency. The scope of what the FBI knew about his activities, if anything, is unclear. It seems hard to believe, given that the FBI was monitoring Pavlov, but it could well be that the bureau simply missed the fact that a KGB officer was meeting regularly with someone involved with the Reagan campaign. (The FBI and CIA both declined to comment about Pavlov, CIA-FBI tensions or the related issues of using Americans as agents.) The lack of coordination between the FBI and CIA wasn’t isolated to Greenagel and Pavlov. Greenagel also helped recruit a former colleague of his from the Chamber of Commerce, Jim Haynes, to work for the CIA. Haynes was subsequently contacted by Steve Orwell. Around 1975, with Orwell’s guidance, Haynes feigned interest in obtaining a visa to visit Moscow to write a story for the Chamber of Commerce about the Soviet Union’s preparatory work for the 1980 Olympics. His target was Konstantin Koryavin, a KGB officer posing as a Soviet diplomat in charge of the visa process. Like Greenagel and Orwell, Haynes began to meet up with Koryavin. But unlike Pavlov, Koryavin seemed more interested in women than politics. “His head was on a swivel. He was looking at every female that walked by,” recalls Haynes. Once, when Koryavin’s wife was back in Moscow, the Soviet diplomat contacted Haynes with a request: He wanted to visit the local strip clubs. So, on a damp, chilly San Francisco evening, the two men caroused around North Beach, drunkenly patronizing the neighborhood’s topless joints. After that boozy night, Haynes met with Orwell. “I asked him, ‘What’s the endgame?’ And he says, ‘What do you mean’? ‘Well,’ I asked, ‘what am I supposed to do with this guy?’ Orwell says, ‘Wait a minute. Time out. You’re not in some James Bond book. We’re not looking for anything funny. What we want to do is establish a relationship. Get him to trust you. Get him to like you.’ And ideally, my role was to get him hooked on life in the United States so when he rotated back to Moscow he could be turned.” That never happened. After a year or so, Haynes took a job out of state, ending his work with the CIA and his relationship with Koryavin, who later moved to the Soviet mission to the United Nations in New York. One evening, Koryavin was stopped by the FBI while covertly delivering cash to officials in the tiny U.S. Communist Party in New York. FBI officers “stuffed [Koryavin] in a booth” at a local restaurant and attempted to recruit the KGB officer to work for the Americans, says Kinane. The FBI, which was apparently unaware of the CIA’s efforts back in San Francisco, was unsuccessful. In the cat and mouse game of recruiting Cold War spies, it’s hard to say who came out ahead. What is perhaps most striking about Pavlov’s efforts to develop contacts in the Reagan camp was, in fact, how fruitless they seemed in the end. Some of the academics Pavlov targeted did indeed end up working in presidential administrations, recalls Kinane, though Pavlov failed to recruit any of them. If Pavlov failed to infiltrate the Reagan campaign, it would appear the CIA also failed to turn the frustrated KGB officer with a “messianic complex” to the other side. But there are signs that he and his wife at least contemplated what life in the United States might be like. One day, says Greenagel, the two men were out drinking, and, out of the blue, Pavlov posed a pregnant question. “John,” he asked, “Do you think I could ever pass as an American?” Taken aback — and instructed by Orwell to discourage defection — Greenagel muttered something about his accented English and dowdy suits betraying foreign origins. Pavlov never brought it up again. Another time, during one of their regular social engagements, Pavlov invited Greenagel up to his apartment — the only time, in fact, he visited Pavlov’s home, says Greenagel. Pavlov lived in a beautiful, spacious place near the Presidio, just down the hill from the Soviet Consulate. Greenagel met Pavlov’s wife, Natalia, who spent most of her days in the apartment watching television and trying to learn English. When Greenagel looked around the apartment, he was shocked at how Pavlov’s wife had decorated the place. She had covered entire walls with cut-out photos from American magazines. Sometime around 1980, Pavlov rotated out of San Francisco. Before leaving, he introduced Greenagel to another diplomat based at the consulate, Alexander Potemkin, who wasn’t previously on the CIA’s radar. Nonetheless, Potemkin continued to see Greenagel, and Greenagel continued to report back to the CIA. One time, Greenagel invited Potemkin over to his apartment in Pacific Heights for drinks. The Soviet diplomat showed up with a colleague from the embassy who Greenagel suspected was a security officer. After a few drinks, Potemkin’s colleague got aggressive, and began to grill him. “We think you’re FBI,” he said to Greenagel. “I don’t have a goddamn thing to do with the FBI,” Greenagel replied — which was true. Despite the alcohol-fueled confrontation, Greenagel and Potemkin still met up occasionally, though their contacts were less frequent and petered out by 1984, when Greenagel took a job down in Silicon Valley. (Potemkin now works at the Washington, D.C.-based American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation. According to an article in Russia Beyond, part of a Russian state news agency, Potemkin retired from the Russian diplomatic service in 1993 and “received authorization from both the Russian and U.S. governments to stay on and become an advocate for cross-cultural exchange and promotion.” He did not respond to a request for comment.) Greenagel’s time as a CIA asset drew to a close, and he never knew what became of Pavlov. But Kinane, the former FBI agent, heard through the grapevine the KGB official’s life back in Moscow was grim: that Pavlov’s daughter was killed by a drunk driver in Moscow and that he and his wife split apart after that. Eventually, Kinane was told, Pavlov sank into alcoholism and died. Smith, the other former FBI agent, remembered Pavlov fondly, at least in the professional sense. “We respected him a great deal,” Smith said. “He was a good KGB officer.” By good, Smith meant smart and hard-working, as opposed, perhaps, to Koryavin — the KGB officer the FBI tried to recruit in New York. Koryavin reappeared in the 1990s, when Kinane served as the FBI’s legal attaché in Moscow. The Soviet Union had fallen apart, and the government, including its spy service, was in disarray. Koryavin contacted Kinane through an intermediary, not to offer his services as a spy, but to sell a fake Stradivarius string instrument. He was “a con man of the first order,” says Kinane. CIA officer Steve Orwell, whose real name Greenagel learned was Harold Chipman, died in 1988; his obituary in the Washington Post, while noting his residence in San Francisco and work as a cryptographer at the Army Security Agency, does not mention any CIA affiliation. (Chipman is identified as a CIA officer in “Blond Ghost,” a 1994 book by David Corn.) While Greenagel’s relationship with Pavlov may never have yielded any great catch for the CIA, by way of a turned KGB officer, it did allow the CIA to keep tabs on Moscow’s interest in infiltrating the Reagan camp. Moscow’s interest in gaining inroads into political campaigns is unchanged. What changed, at least by 2016, was the reaction from the Republican presidential candidate and his campaign, which was much less suspicious of Russian outreach. Four decades after Pavlov cozied up to Greenagel, hoping to make contacts in the Reagan camp, key members of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, including the candidate’s son, Donald Trump Jr., met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York. That meeting, and other contacts between Russian officials and the Trump camp, is now at the center of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. If the American public is surprised by Russian outreach to the Trump campaign, intelligence officials, particularly those who worked cases during the Cold War, are not. “People think this is new. This isn’t new. The Russians have been doing this stuff for 40 or 50 years. It’s news now because they’ve been so successful,” says Smith, the former FBI counterintelligence agent. “You’ve got to hand it to the Russians: they know what they’re doing. They’re more and more sophisticated; they’ve learned an awful lot. Now they get somebody like Donald Trump Jr. meeting with them — they’re killing them — because Americans like Trump Jr. don’t know what they’re doing.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News:

He said that portion of the wall had been completed on Jan. 30, some 47 days ahead of schedule, and that “many miles more” currently were being built. We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 – 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall pic.twitter.com/TYkj3KRdOC Trump retweeted the post on Thursday and added an all-caps caption saying the wall was under construction. THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW! https://t.co/exUJCiITsz However, it’s not true that the wall featured in the video had been “just built.” The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose logo appears in the bottom corner of the video Trump shared, actually produced the clip in September 2018, a spokesperson told veterans news website Task & Purpose. It shows “a replacement project” for a section of a barrier that was in place before Trump assumed office. Trump has declared a national emergency in an attempt to secure money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. MSNBC’s Brian Williams also noted the discrepancy of Trump’s claim and the reality of the situation on Thursday’s broadcast of “The 11th Hour.” President Trump tweeted a time-lapse video of work along the border wall in New Mexico: "Many miles more now under construction."

---split---9.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/author/matt-bai---split---Pete Buttigieg would rather talk about his record as the two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind., than about his identity as the first openly gay man to seek the Democratic nomination. Our developer president could have focused his energy on building airports, high-speed rail lines and high-tech schools. But he can only think of one place to sink a shovel, and that’s turning out to be the sinkhole of his administration. Howard Schultz is one of very few people on the planet who had the vision to transform the way we live. He saw where the culture was headed and figured out a way to get ahead of it. No one in politics is doing that. The question facing former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, if he decides to run against Trump, is this: Do you try to take out the incumbent president in the primaries, or do you make an independent bid instead? President Trump doesn’t think our defense of democratic values really works for America anymore, and in this he has more in common with Vladimir Putin than he does with his own Cabinet or his military. In Trump’s America, taking personal responsibility for anything you say or do is suddenly out of vogue, no matter which side you’re on or how petty the issue. Back in 2015, I sat down with President Obama, during a visit to Nike’s Oregon campus, to talk about the huge Asian trade pact he was trying to sell. It was what Obama said that day about Elizabeth Warren, who had become a vocal critic of the trade deal, that landed like a grenade. What crude and awful The contrast to focus on in 2020 isn’t just right versus left. It’s short term versus long term. It’s quarterly returns versus a half century of peril. When Trump flouts the conventions of the office, he’s winning with his core voters. It doesn’t matter what he’s saying — what matters is that he’s making the rest of us howl in indignation. It was hard to watch George H.W. Bush’s funeral proceedings this week and not wonder how Donald Trump’s last farewell will someday compare. A few of the Democratic Party’s young stars in the House took on Nancy Pelosi this week and proved mainly that none of them have anything like the political acumen to replace her. In a movie where virtually all the characters live in a gray zone of morality, should the journalists be exempt? Do we have to choose between defending ourselves from a demagogue and reckoning with our role in having created him? By any historical measure, the Democrats had a pretty great night Tuesday, and the president’s party did not. Donald Trump calls himself a “nationalist.” You needn’t be a racist to believe that national identity and borders matter. Trump makes no pretense of balancing moral imperatives, or even military objectives, against the economic agenda that is his only real priority. The Supreme Court hearings are starting to feel less like the #MeToo movement and more like ruinous politics, Matt Bai says. The fact is that at this elite level of the American judiciary, everybody's smart. But not everybody's good, Matt Bai writes. Trump’s safe choice for the high court has become the last thing he and the GOP needed so close to midterms, Matt Bai writes. Ten years ago last month, I wrote a long cover story for the New York Times Magazine titled: “Is Obama the End of Black Politics?” The central point of the essay, which featured dozens of black leaders and provoked no shortage of debate, was that Barack Obama’s nomination in 2008 marked a turning point Trump’s aides say it’s their duty to protect the president from himself, even if that means stealing papers off his desk.

The condominium board of 120 Riverside Boulevard on Manhattan’s Upper West Side announced the move Thursday, The Washington Post reported, with just over half of condo owners voting in favor of tearing down the “Trump Place” sign above the front door. The Trump name has been removed from at least four other nearby buildings since the 2016 presidential campaign, according to The New York Times. In October, residents of one decided to remove the “Trump Place” exterior lettering in a rejection of the president by the city in which he launched his career as a high-profile real estate developer. Neither the president nor his real estate company own any of the properties. Though Trump planned to develop the neighborhood in the 1970s, he never followed through and sold his interest to other developers, according to the Times. His company still manages some of the buildings that had been given the Trump Place names. In addition to ditching the Trump signs, the buildings have trashed Trump-embossed lobby mats and Trump-branded attire for concierges and doormen. One last building in the neighborhood still bears a “Trump Place” sign, at 220 Riverside Boulevard. That building’s board rejected a name change in 2016, citing the potential for litigation and the cost of removing the sign, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.
---split---10.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-voters/ten-questions-we-hope-robert-mueller-will-answer-n974446---split---WASHINGTON — Mueller Time is getting near, with NBC News and other news organizations reporting that the special counsel is expected to submit his report soon. While the Russia probe has led to indictments against 34 different individuals and has produced six guilty pleas – hardly a witch hunt – there’s still so much we don’t know. So here’s a handy list of 10 questions we hope/think/expect Mueller to answer. And these are just the known unknowns. There also may be unknown unknowns. (Thank you, Donald Rumsfeld.) As Wired’s Garrett Graff recently wrote, “Let's remember that there have been two immutable truths thus far in the Mueller probe: First, every move has surprised us, both in timing and content; and second, every court filing has been more informed, detailed, and insightful than anyone imagined, and shown us that what we knew publicly was only the tip of the iceberg.” Well, it sure looks like 2019 will bring us a competitive congressional special election in a key 2020 Senate/presidential state. NBC’s Leigh Ann Caldwell and Dartunorro Clark: “The North Carolina Board of Elections on Thursday ordered a new election in the 9th Congressional District after allegations of illegal activity in the handling of mail-in ballots.” “The five-member board's unanimous action came after several days of hearings into Republican ballot-collecting practices in the 2018 general election.” Caldwell adds that the board of elections will be in charge of the upcoming special – contrasted with the governor’s office in charge of the open seat in NC-3 after Rep. Walter Jones died. (So North Carolina will have TWO specials this year, likely on the same day.) Will Republican Mark Harris run in the do-over? His attorney told Caldwell that the answer is “premature.” But Caldwell doesn’t expect him to run. Democrat Dan McCready, on the other hand, will absolutely run, Caldwell says. He’s already put out a fundraising appeal. Bottom line: This special election will be a big deal in a key battleground state. Fun Fact: The last redo congressional election appears to be in #LA06 in Jan 1975 after a voting machine malfunction. Henson Moore (R) led Jeff LaCaze (D) led by 44 votes on Election Night 1974. State court ordered a new election & Moore won easily #NC09https://t.co/6Dl3l7e5nG The governors are in DC, with the National Governors Association meetings this weekend. And guess which GOP governor is making some news: “Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday he expects to make a springtime trip to New Hampshire as he weighs a 2020 challenge to Donald Trump — and accused the Republican National Committee of going to extraordinary lengths to shield the president from a potentially draining primary,” Politico writes. “Typically they try to be fair arbiters of a process and I’ve never seen anything like it and I’ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life. It’s unprecedented. And in my opinion it’s not the way we should be going about our politics,” Hogan told Politico. Again, modern American history hasn’t been too kind to incumbent presidents who get a primary challenge – whether it’s a Larry Hogan or even a Bill Weld… On the campaign trail this Friday, per NBC’s Kyle Stewart: Kamala Harris is in New Orleans for “Power Rising 2019”… Elizabeth Warren stumps in New Hampshire… And Julian Castro and Michael Bennet are in Iowa. On Saturday, Harris, Castro, Bennet and John Hickenlooper are in the Hawkeye State… Warren remains in New Hampshire… And Sherrod Brown is in Nevada. And on Sunday, Harris stays in Iowa… While Cory Booker is in Nevada. The number of the day is… 3 percentage points — that’s the difference between the share of voters who say Donald Trump’s rhetoric is “mean-spirited and divisive” (46 percent) and the share who say Trump just “tells it like it is” (43 percent), per new polling conducted for the Dem group Priorities USA. And that’s … not a lot. For all the time Democrats have spent calling Trump out on his language and tweets, Priorities actually found a much bigger advantage for these Democratic messaging points: So “mean and divisive” isn’t the winning message for Dems. The one that might be? That Trump is ineffective and only out to enrich himself and his wealthy friends.

Those were the stories that dominated the week. But don’t miss these other stories that would have BIG news in other eras: (Under the Ralph Northam standard – that your early life/career is more than fair game – how is this story about the current Labor secretary not a huge deal?) In other news today… Sasha Issenberg has a deep look “inside the radical campaign strategy” of Beto O’Rourke. Elizabeth Warren backs reparations for black Americans. Kamala Harris is “disappointed” about the revelations in the Jussie Smollett case. Steve King says “I have nothing to apologize for” and plans to run again. And more news clips that should be on your radar… TRUMP AGENDA: Stone Cold Roger Stone faces a full gag order after posting an image appearing to show Judge Amy Berman Jackson in crosshairs. The U.S. will leave about 200 “peacekeeping” troops in Syria. Trump hasn’t weighed in yet on the Coast Guard officer who allegedly plotted attacks on Democratic politicians and journalists. House Dems are preparing a proposal to halt Trump’s emergency declaration. Democrats say that Trump isn’t keeping Congress in the loop on North Korea. Paul Kane has a smart look at why Democrats are looking to candidates other than popular but very familiar faces. Bernie Sanders seems to be edging Elizabeth Warren in the battle for the left.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-russia-probe-trump-wrap-up-scenarios/---split---The breaking news hit a snowy Washington, DC on Wednesday: Newly installed attorney general William Barr appears to be preparing to announce the end of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. But what would “Mueller wrapping up” actually mean? And does the rapid movement, soon after Barr was installed at the Justice Department, indicate that he shut down the Mueller probe prematurely? A recent New York Times article documenting Trump’s two-year-long campaign to obstruct and muddy the investigation exacerbated those fears, as did an ominous tweet by conservative commentator—and White House spouse—Matt Schlapp pronouncing that “Mueller will be gone soon.” The tea leaves around Mueller in recent weeks seem especially hard to read—and they’re conflicting at best. CNN’s special counsel stakeout has spotted prosecutors working long hours, through snow days and holidays—just as they were in the days before Michael Cohen’s surprise guilty plea last fall for lying to Congress—yet there’s also been no apparent grand jury movement since Roger Stone’s indictment. So even as CNN’s stakeout spotted DC prosecutors entering Mueller’s offices—the type of people who Mueller might hand off cases to as he winds down—and the special counsel’s staff carting out boxes, there’s also recent evidence that Mueller still has a longer game in mind. The Stone prosecution is just getting underway; Mueller is still litigating over a mystery foreign company. And he’s pushing forward trying to gain testimony from a Stone associate, Andrew Miller. What does “wrapping up” even look like? In fact, the list of loose threads at this point is, in some ways, longer than the list of what Mueller has done publicly. There’s conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi’s aborted plea deal; would-be Middle East power broker George Nader’s lengthy cooperation with Mueller, which has resulted in no public charges; the mysterious Seychelles meeting between Blackwater mercenary founder Erik Prince and a Russian businessman; and then, of course, the big question of obstruction of justice. Add to that the recent witness testimony from the House Intelligence Committee that Democratic representative Adam Schiff has turned over to Mueller’s office, in which other witnesses, according to Schiff, appear to have lied to Congress. Besides, there are a host of bread crumbs that Mueller left in the more than 500 pages of his court filings that would all prove superfluous if further action didn’t lie ahead. Open questions remain, too, about bit characters like Carter Page. The seemingly hapless, hat-wearing onetime foreign policy aide was one of the starting points of the entire Russia probe—and the controversial FISA warrant that targeted him was renewed twice, in 2016 and 2017, meaning that investigators found evidence at the time that he was still being targeted by foreign agents. And yet he’s nearly disappeared from the public radar of the Russia probe. Does he reemerge—or is Page merely destined to become the Rosencrantz or Guildenstern of the Russia investigation? Or what about the odd communications between a Trump organization computer server and a server belonging to Russia’s Alfa Bank, which The New Yorker’s Dexter Filkins dove into last October? There remain many open questions, even as the consensus around Washington appears to be zeroing in on Mueller “wrapping up.” But what would that actually entail? Are we just hours away from a sweeping indictment that makes public the pee tape and explains every intimate detail of a years-long plot to co-opt Donald Trump as a Russian intelligence asset dating all the way back to 1987, as Jonathan Chait has argued? Or are we heading to what the president’s lawyers have said all along—that, as awful as the unrelated criminalities of Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Michael Cohen were, none of that amounts to “collusion,” and this entire enterprise has been a worthless "witch hunt!" by 13 angry Democrats? Also, what does “wrapping up” even look like? Robert Mueller has written a “Mueller report” once before, examining the Ray Rice domestic violence incident for the NFL, one of his first projects after stepping down as FBI director. It was a 96-page report that overwhelmed with the tenacity and thoroughness of Mueller’s investigation. Five pages of the report focused on how packages were signed for in the NFL mailroom, and Mueller’s team tracked down all 1,583 telephone calls that went in or out of NFL headquarters during the period in question. Yet its conclusions were narrow, and left many critics of the league frustrated. Mueller stopped well short of the sweeping pronouncements and indictments that many had hoped he’d bring against the NFL’s culture of coddling alleged abusers. In some ways, that report helps illustrate just what we might expect in the hours, days, weeks, or months ahead as Mueller “wraps up.” In broad strokes, there are seven scenarios that “Mueller wrapping up” could really mean: 1. Mueller sends the attorney general a simple “declination letter,” telling Bill Barr that he’s concluded his work as special counsel; that the related grand jury has charged all identified crimes worthy of prosecution; and that there are no further cases to come. In some ways, a letter this simple—which itself would represent a stunning anticlimax to the most politically charged investigation in modern American history—would be the most “Mueller-like,” an understated and quiet end to the probe by a man who has always preferred to let his work speak for itself. If Mueller stops here, with no further meaty comment or additional charges, his probe will still rank as one of the most significant and eye-opening counterintelligence probes in our history, even though it would have failed to identify any direct “collusion” between Trump and Russia. 2. Mueller compiles a detailed “road map,” providing Congress with an annotated bibliography or an index of sorts, outlining impeachment-worthy presidential “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes and others pried out of the National Archives the analogous document that the Watergate special prosecutor created to help Congress charge President Nixon; it's a detailed guide to evidence and grand jury testimony that could inform an impeachment trial. This might be the most compelling conclusion for Mueller if he’s abiding by the Justice Department's policy that the sitting president can’t be indicted, but he has identified criminal behavior by the president himself. It may be similarly attractive if Mueller has found compromising actions by the president that fall short of a chargeable federal crime, but that nonetheless represent political behavior or collusion that a healthy democracy cannot abide in its leaders or candidates. 3. Mueller authors a detailed novelistic narrative, akin to what the 9/11 Commission wrote or what Ken Starr authored at the conclusion of his Whitewater hearing, a document that could stretch to hundreds of pages and provide in rich, narrative detail—with footnotes aplenty—the be-all and end-all story of the Russians' impact on the 2016 election and the role that Trump associates may or may not have played in that. While this document is most similar to what many Americans have long believed the “Mueller report” would look like, in some ways this seems the least likely outcome simply because it’s the most sweeping, which would go against Mueller’s inherent instincts. 4. He offers both a final round of “his” indictments, as well as a detailed report like in 2 or 3 above. Mueller’s existing court filings point to the idea that he’s considering or building toward a final overarching conspiracy indictment, one that connects Americans to the Russian attack on the election—either via WikiLeaks, Russian intelligence asset Konstantin Kilimnik, or other avenues. If this is the final outcome, it’s possible that Mueller already has told us precisely what he’s doing. After all, last summer’s GRU indictment began with the charge that “GRU officers … knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other, and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury (collectively the “Conspirators”), to gain unauthorized access (to “hack”) into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election.” That language could easily encompass Americans who participated, and since both the GRU indictment and the IRA indictment are “conspiracy” cases, Mueller could wrap up by simply filling in some more of those “persons known … to the Grand Jury,” e.g., Americans who participated in the plot. 5. He offers a report, but not the report, something more like a progress report rather than a single, definitive one. This scenario could also include multiple reports—concerning perhaps not just the Russian probe but broader investigations into foreign influence in Washington. The Daily Beast hinted in December that Mueller was preparing a special report on Middle Eastern influence in the 2016 election, which might or might not be separate from the question of Russian influence in the campaign. This progress report could also announce that’s he finished investigating the “Big Question” (the extent of Russia’s role in the 2016 election) but that he intends to continue sorting through ancillary matters—like, for instance, the Roger Stone case, the House witness transcripts, or the foreign mystery defendant—for perhaps months or even years. 6. He closes up shop but refers numerous active cases to other prosecutors—similarly ensuring that his probe lives on for years to come. Again, this could be because he feels like he’s answered his main charge—Russia—even though he’s uncovered much ancillary criminality. Schiff has begun hinting in recent weeks that he feels Mueller has been too narrow in his investigation, and that he intends to dive deep into Trump World’s money laundering and past business deals. The special counsel construct and mission was never perfect—and Mueller, if the Ray Rice case is a guide, may indeed have interpreted his charge narrowly, leaving big and worthy questions to be examined by prosecutors in DC, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and elsewhere. The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and counterparts in DC and Virginia, already have picked up at least half a dozen ancillary cases among them. 7. Mueller unseals one or more long-standing sealed indictments. The media and bloggers have regularly tracked the abnormally large number of sealed indictments filed over the last year in DC federal court, the jurisdiction where Mueller has been worked, including 14 added between August and November—a period where Mueller was theoretically “quiet” around the midterm election—and four recent sealed indictments that seemed to parallel the Stone indictment. Whether any relate to Mueller remains to be seen, but in some ways the idea of piling up sealed indictments would have been the smartest way for Mueller to ensure that if he was fired, his case lived on. While the seven scenarios above capture the broad outlines of what the end of his probe might look like, the truth is that he could choose some of one and a bit of another, meaning that there are almost infinite variations of how the case could unfold from him in the days ahead. It’s also worth noting that the Mueller probe—however it ends—represents a shrinking percentage of Trump’s potential legal troubles, as a total of at least 18 investigations surround Trump’s world, led by at least seven different prosecutors and investigators. (Since WIRED’s original tally of 17 distinct investigations in December, we’ve seen news of a state and federal probe looking at undocumented workers at Trump’s New Jersey golf club.) And all of that doesn’t count any of the work by the new Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s ongoing work, nor any of the other probes led by other House committees. Even a complete and total exoneration by Mueller on the Russia question would represent only a tiny ray of legal sunshine for the president. Nevertheless, there’s good reason to believe that Trump won’t get that total exoneration, as Mueller’s conspicuous silences in court filings on the collusion question seem to indicate he’s building toward something. Let's remember that there have been two immutable truths thus far in the Mueller probe: First, every move has surprised us, both in timing and content; and second, every court filing has been more informed, detailed, and insightful than anyone imagined, and shown us that what we knew publicly was only the tip of the iceberg. There's no reason to think that Mueller's denouement will be anything different. Garrett M.

---split---11.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/alabama-republicans-arent-stressing-roy-moore-redux-senate-primary-kicks-off---split---Alabama Rep. Bradley Byrne announced Wednesday that he was running for Senate. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Updated 9:21 p.m. | Alabama Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne launched his Senate campaign Wednesday, kicking off the contest to take on one of the most vulnerable senators in the country: Democrat Doug Jones. “The main reason I’m running is that we’ve got somebody in the United state Senate, Sen. Doug Jones, who does not reflect the values or policy positions of the state of Alabama,” Byrne said in a phone interview after announcing his Senate run in Mobile. Jones won a 2017 special election, upsetting former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore. After emerging from a contested GOP primary, Moore faced decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. A combination of increased Democratic turnout and Republicans who couldn’t stomach supporting Moore led to a narrow Jones victory, the first for a Democrat in the deep-red state in a quarter-century. Even though Republicans are once again expecting a competitive Senate primary, party operatives largely aren’t worried about history repeating itself. “If you have the ‘R’ by your name, you are going to beat Doug Jones, especially in a presidential year,” Alabama GOP strategist Brent Buchanan said. Byrne doesn’t agree. “If we just sit back and let it go we’ll end up with the wrong person again,” he said. “So this is a strong statement on my part that I want the right person. I think I’m the right person.” Also watch: First 2020 Senate race ratings are here Some Republicans in Alabama point to a unique set of circumstances that led to Moore defeating appointed Sen. Luther Strange in the 2017 GOP primary. Gov. Robert Bentley, who later resigned under a cloud of scandal, had picked Strange to fill the seat vacated by former Sen. Jeff Sessions when Sessions became attorney general. Strange was tainted by questions surrounding his appointment and lost a primary runoff to Moore, despite having President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, had blanketed the airwaves during the primary with ads to boost Strange and attack his opponents. SLF declined to comment on its approach to the 2020 Senate race in Alabama. “I think that the Washington involvement in that race caused the outcome as much as perhaps too many candidates in the race,” said Alabama state Sen. Del Marsh, who is also considering entering the GOP primary. “So I don’t see that happening this time.” It’s unclear if Moore is going to run again. He said last year he wasn’t considering running for office but “plans change.” Moore’s spokeswoman and former campaign manager did not respond to requests for comment, but some Alabama Republicans don’t expect him to run as he is still trying to clear his name. GOP candidates besides Moore wouldn’t likely turn off as many Republicans, whose crossover votes were key to Jones’ victory. Moore’s reputation as a controversial judge who was twice removed from the bench made him unpalatable to some GOP voters from the start of the Senate race. The allegations, first reported by The Washington Post less than five weeks before the general election, exacerbated that rejection. “There isn’t another Roy Moore out there,” one GOP consultant involved in Alabama races said. But Byrne called that line of thinking “dangerous,” saying some potential candidates would struggle in a general election, although he didn’t name names. “Don’t get me wrong, I think it would take some pretty extreme disabilities in order for … a Republican not to win next year,” the congressman said. “But it can happen.” “We need to be on our guard, have the best person we can put out there and go win this race. And go win it by a big margin so that we don’t have to deal with this again,” he added. Republicans see Alabama as a prime pickup opportunity. Trump carried the state by 28 points in 2016, and he’ll be on the ballot again in 2020. And Jones won by less than 2 points. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race Leans Republican. Jones is expected to put up a fight, leveraging his massive donor list from the special election and an effective turnout operation. Byrne said he expected the Democrat to outraise him. Jones’ campaign had $2.1 million on hand at the end of the year, while Byrne had nearly $1.1 million in the bank. Absent some of the 2017 circumstances, next year’s GOP primary could look more like a typical Republican contest. That means candidates will be battling over their conservative credentials and loyalty to Trump. Byrne enters the race with statewide campaign experience. The former state senator lost a 2010 gubernatorial primary to Bentley before winning a special election for the House in 2013. In 2016, Byrne called on Trump to step aside as the GOP nominee, following the revelation of the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women’s genitals. Byrne said Wednesday those comments would not be an issue in the primary. He ended up voting for Trump and has supported the president’s priorities 97 percent of the time, according to an analysis by CQ Vote Watch. Byrne said he has since occasionally spoken with Trump and has a “great” working relationship with him and his staff, if not a personal one with the president. He said he did not yet want to comment on whether he has spoken with Trump or his staff about running for Senate. Marsh, the president of the state Senate, said his business background and unwavering support for Trump would separate him from other primary candidates if he decides to run. Asked if he was referring to Byrne’s 2016 remarks, Marsh said, “I think that is important. It’s easy to listen to the political winds and attack people but … I think that somebody needs to have shown continued support.” Marsh said he would decide on running for Senate “sooner rather than later,” adding that he has discussed the race with Ward Baker, the former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Baker said he has not been hired by Marsh as a consultant. It’s not clear if national Republicans will have a preferred candidate in the race. Byrne said he has spoken with McConnell, but declined to comment on those conversations. GOP Rep. Gary Palmer is “definitely weighing a campaign for the Senate,” but he has not decided yet, a source close to the campaign with knowledge of internal deliberations said. The conservative Club for Growth released a poll a few hours ahead of Byrne’s announcement showing Palmer and Byrne tied at 27 percent in a hypothetical Republican primary, with 46 percent of respondents undecided. WPA Intelligence surveyed 500 likely GOP primary voters from Feb. 10-12. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Palmer and Marsh are two names that GOP strategists have mentioned as likely candidates in addition to Bryne. Alabama Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, who took office last month, has been mentioned as a potential Senate contender, but two GOP sources said he is unlikely to run. There’s been some speculation that Sessions might run for his old seat after he stepped down as attorney general amid a tense relationship with Trump. Asked if he discussed the Senate race with Sessions, Byrne said he has spoken with him two or three times but wanted to keep those conversations private. GOP Rep. Martha Roby is also not planning to run for Senate after fending off a primary challenger last year and facing criticism for not voting for Trump in 2016. (She has since worked to repair her relationship with the White House.) Roby’s spokeswoman said in an email that Roby was not going to run for Senate in 2020. One GOP source said Roby and other potential statewide contenders could be eyeing a run for governor, or Senate in 2022 should GOP Sen. Richard C. Shelby decide to retire.

President Trump will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next week in Vietnam. (Photo via Wikimedia Commons) Just days before President Donald Trump will be face-to-face again with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the two sides remain divided on one of the biggest issues at the heart of their second summit. Among the many unresolved issues as Trump and Kim prepare for another meeting Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam is a common definition of what “denuclearization” would mean for the reclusive Asian country. A senior Trump administration official told reporters on a call Thursday morning that one of the top agenda items for the leaders’ second meeting is trying to agree to a “shared understanding of what denuclearization is.” [After contentious border moves, stakes only get higher for Trump] “It is ultimately about the denuclearization of North Korea,” the senior official said. “That is what was agreed to [in their first summit last June]. That is the overriding goal that the president is seeking to achieve with this summit. … Eventually, we are going to need a full declaration in order to complete the process of denuclearization.” The senior official described the June summit in Singapore as Trump and Kim “really, in some respects, breaking the ice.” But this time, both sides plan for the duo to “talk in more depth about the kind of future that North Korea could enjoy if it follows through on its commitment to final and full denuclearization.” But Kim and his top lieutenants have not yet made it clear to their American counterparts that they define denuclearization as “final and full.” The dispute over just how much of its nuclear and missile programs Pyongyang would give up in return for things like major sanctions relief likely will not be decided next week, Trump and his top national security aides have made clear in recent weeks. “I have no pressing time schedule,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. But he again made clear he would “like to see, ultimately, [the] denuclearization of North Korea.” Like the commander in chief, the senior official on Thursday sought to tamp down expectations for the high-profile meeting, saying the White House hopes the two-day meeting will produce agreement on “an ongoing process of give-and-take.” Trump’s public schedules this week have not included any meetings or other prep work for the second meeting with Kim. But the senior official described him as “doing everything necessary to be fully prepared.” [Twitter taunts Rep. Eric Swalwell after Trump Tower selfie] The White House this week said Trump has had phone conversations with allies in the region — something GOP and Democratic lawmakers say will need to continue if he hopes to eventually reach a deal with Kim. “Adept and agile diplomacy is critically needed on the Korean Peninsula,” Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said in a Feb. 12 statement. “The United States must continue to support and bolster our engagement across the region, and work with Japan and [South] Korea to build a forward-looking partnership for the 21st century.” One House Democratic source said members will be pressing the president before he departs early next week to secure a firm commitment from Kim on returning the remains of U.S. troops killed there during the Korean war. The senior official told reporters that matter will be on the agenda next week. With unresolved matters like that key definition remaining, the senior Trump official contended there is no plan to strike a deal for the sake of doing so. The North must agree to a deal that meets “the international standard on how to go about addressing the issue of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in a country like North Korea” the official said. “Nothing will be agreed to until everything is agreed to.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/space-force-official-parody-already-here---split---President Donald Trump speaks to the media after signing the Space Policy Directive 4, during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) President Donald Trump made Space Force official, but that might have been hard to tell at first from Tuesday in the Oval Office, as the chief executive held court on several satellite issues. “During my administration, we’re doing so much in space. We need it,” Trump said, surrounded by military brass as he signed a directive establishing Space Force within the Air Force. But before the president even got to the reason for Tuesday’s event, he uttered nearly 400 words describing a constellation of diplomatic successes with North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un. “I had a great conversation this morning with President Moon of South Korea,” Trump said of South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. “And we obviously discussed the upcoming trip next week, where we’re going to Hanoi, in Vietnam. And I look forward to be with Chairman Kim, and I think a lot of things will come out of it.” It wasn’t just Trump who drifted off topic. Reporters peppered the president with questions about trade with China, Bernie Sanders’ presidential run, North Korea and what he might have discussed with his acting attorney general about the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “I wish Bernie well. It will be interesting to see how he does,” Trump said of his fellow New York native, before expounding on one of his favorite topics, the 2016 election. “I think what happened to Bernie maybe was not so nice. I think he was taken advantage of. He ran great four years ago, and he was not treated with respect by [Hillary Clinton.] And that was too bad. I thought what happened to Bernie Sanders four years ago was quite sad as it pertains to our country. So we’ll see how he does,” Trump said. “You’ve got a lot of people running, but only one person is going to win. I hope you know who that person is,” Trump said as he ended the event. At least one public official wanted to focus on space. Before Trump was done talking, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he would be asking the president to fill in blank space on the Space Coast, where Cape Canaveral is located. “Today, I am formally sending a request to @realDonaldTrump to place the headquarters for the Space Force Combatant Command here in Florida @NASAKennedy in Cape Canaveral,” DeSantis tweeted. “This is part of Florida’s history and is a logical fit for our state,” said the governor, a former Republican congressman. Today, I am formally sending a request to @realDonaldTrump to place the headquarters for the Space Force Combatant Command here in Florida @NASAKennedy in Cape Canaveral. This is part of Florida's history and is a logical fit for our state.  And Space Force, a familiar chant at Trump rallies, perhaps got the ultimate validation over the weekend, when a verified @realspaceforce ‏account appeared — to flog a parody story about the future star fleet. The account was created to preview a Netflix show from the creative team behind the U.S. version of “The Office,” star Steve Carell and showrunner Greg Daniels. The preview features the tune of “Thus Spake Zarathustra” (aka the “2001: A Space Odyssey” theme) while images and words are superimposed over an image of the sun rising over Earth (more lifting from “2001”). From the guys that brought you The Office. Welcome to Space Force. pic.twitter.com/cbPnDCVfCp  “On June 18, 2018, the federal government announced the creation of a sixth major division of the United States armed forces,” the words read. “The goal of the new branch is ‘to defend satellites from attack’ and ‘perform other space-related tasks.’ Or something.” the preview says. “This is the story of the men and women who have to figure it out.” Perhaps they could get their b-roll from C-SPAN.

---split---14.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/asia/south-korea-north-korea-trump-kim-summit.html---split---Supported by By Choe Sang-Hun SEOUL, South Korea — If there is anyone keeping his fingers crossed for President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to agree on how to denuclearize the North when they meet in Vietnam this month, it is President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. With no quick fix available for South Korea’s stubborn economic troubles, Mr. Moon’s best chance for reversing his falling approval ratings rests on whether he can jump-start his signature policy of helping advance the North’s denuclearization and improving inter-Korean ties. But that depends on Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim striking a denuclearization deal when they meet Feb. 27-28 in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, that is significant enough for Washington and the United Nations to ease sanctions and create room for Mr. Moon to push his ambitious plans for economic cooperation with North Korea. “But if the second U.S.-North Korea summit fails, there will be more criticism blaming President Moon,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “There will be more critics accusing him of having been too optimistic and naïve, misreading North Korea’s intentions and misrepresenting them to the Americans.” Since his election in 2017, Mr. Moon has dedicated himself to mediating between Washington and Pyongyang, tirelessly selling Mr. Trump on the merits of negotiating with Mr. Kim. In doing so, he has bet so heavily on Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim reaching a denuclearization deal that his own political fortunes at home have become increasingly tied to the whims of the two unpredictable leaders. Mr. Moon’s approval ratings soared higher than 80 percent last spring when he met Mr. Kim twice on the inter-Korean border to help defuse a possible military confrontation between the United States and North Korea. That set the stage for the historic June summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump in Singapore. But Mr. Moon’s ratings have since plummeted below 50 percent amid stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang over how to carry out the vague promise Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim made in Singapore to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and establish a permanent peace between their countries. Mr. Moon flew to Pyongyang in September to meet Mr. Kim again to break the logjam between Washington and Pyongyang. But the deadlock remains, prompting Mr. Moon’s critics to question whether he has oversold Mr. Kim’s willingness to denuclearize. When he met Mr. Moon in September, Mr. Kim promised to become the first North Korean leader to visit Seoul. But with his negotiations with Washington stalled, the year ended without Mr. Kim visiting as Mr. Moon said he would, further raising doubts about Mr. Moon’s influence over Mr. Kim. While Mr. Moon remained preoccupied with North Korea, domestic affairs turned against him. The popularity of his governing Democratic Party has plunged as its politicians have been tainted by #MeToo accusations and other scandals. South Koreans in their 20s, a traditional support base for progressives like Mr. Moon, have been fast losing faith in his government because of his inability to create more jobs, according to the polling company Realmeter. Older, more conservative South Koreans have rallied in central Seoul almost every weekend in recent months, criticizing as dangerous Mr. Moon’s economic policies and his rapprochement efforts with the North. But Mr. Moon remains convinced that Mr. Trump’s strong desire to achieve something none of his predecessors could accomplish — ending the North Korean nuclear crisis — and Mr. Kim’s desperate need to improve his country’s economy can create a singular opportunity for both Koreas. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, he says, can denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and end the tensions there, opening the way for economically integrating the impoverished North, with its cheap labor, and the South, whose slowing economy needs a new source of growth. “We have never had an opportunity like this since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, and we should not miss it because it will never come again,” Mr. Moon said last month. Longtime North Korea observers saw the current stalemate coming when Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim ended their Singapore meeting without sorting out key details, especially what is meant by the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” In the past, the North used that term when it argued that it would give up its nuclear weapons only when the United States ceased hostilities, including ending its military presence in South Korea. Mr. Moon says Mr. Kim has made a strategic decision to give up his nuclear weapons in a “verifiable and irreversible way” and focus on rebuilding his country’s economy should Washington take corresponding actions, like easing sanctions, to prove that it is no longer hostile. He also said last month that there was “no difference” between the United States and North Korean definitions of “complete denuclearization,” saying it meant dismantling all North Korean nuclear weapons and fissile materials and their production facilities. “First, we ought to take him at his word,” Gen. Vincent Brooks, who retired as commander of the American military in South Korea in November, told “PBS NewsHour” last month, referring to Mr. Kim. “And that’s not an easy thing to accept, especially given the track record of North Korea. But this is a new leader in North Korea.” Mr. Trump, who in 2017 threatened to unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea and derided Mr. Kim as “Little Rocket Man” because of his provocative missile tests, now promises to help rebuild the country’s economy if it denuclearizes. “North Korea will become a different kind of rocket — an economic one!” he said on Twitter this month. But last month, Mr. Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, told Congress that North Korea was “unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival.” Nevertheless, Washington’s special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, spent three days in Pyongyang this month exchanging “detailed and exhaustive” lists of what the two governments wanted from each other to make denuclearization possible, said Kim Eui-kyeom, Mr. Moon’s spokesman, after Mr. Biegun briefed South Korean officials on his trip. But with the Hanoi summit meeting less than a week away, South Korean officials said, the two sides are still bargaining to settle the hardest part of their negotiations: figuring out what specific actions they could take in order to start denuclearization. All this makes the Hanoi meeting as much a gamble for Mr. Moon as for Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. Unlike Mr. Kim, who has hedged his bets by improving ties with China, Mr. Moon has put all his eggs in Mr. Trump’s basket, analysts said. “Presidents Moon and Trump are in the same boat on this,” said Kim Sung-han, a former vice foreign minister of South Korea who teaches at Korea University in Seoul.

But what form that will take and how much the public will learn is unclear. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, is working on a report of his findings. But what form that will take and how much the public will learn is unclear. The Russia investigation could be on the verge of a spectacular finale — or it could be about to puff out like a damp firecracker. Or, as has been the case so often before, Washington could be gearing itself up for a fireworks display that doesn't even happen. Despite some indications that special counsel Robert Mueller could be wrapping up, there has been no official word from the Justice Department confirming that's so. But the prospect for the end of the Russia investigation, or at least the end of this phase, has resurrected many questions about where the story stands and what could happen next. Here's what you need to know. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in the spring of 2017 to establish whether there were any links or coordination between President Trump's campaign and the Russians who attacked the 2016 presidential election. That there was an attack is no longer in dispute, and Mueller has shed a great deal of light upon it. The Justice Department has charged Russian intelligence officers with allegedly launching cyberattacks against U.S. political targets and stealing embarrassing material and then releasing it to cause havoc. Other Russians have been charged with using social media agitation to amplify controversy inside the United States and to pit Americans against one another. Investigators also appear to have established that Russians or their intermediaries were in contact with a number of Americans in Trump's orbit. Some of them offered help or to build backchannel relationships. The president goes back and forth about what he accepts about Russia's election interference, but he has been consistent about calling the Mueller investigation a "hoax" or a "witch hunt," part of a conspiracy by disgruntled Justice Department insiders who are out to get him. Trump says he didn't know in 2016, for example, that Russians were making overtures to people on his campaign, including one that resulted in a delegation meeting at Trump Tower with Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Skeptics argue it's implausible that Trump couldn't have known about the Russian outreach, including that meeting, and have pointed to the fact that one month after it took place, Trump asked Russia — "if you're listening" — to try to locate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Mueller's investigators have since established that Russian hackers redoubled their cyberattacks against Clinton that very day. So far it isn't clear whether there was any connection to Trump's comments or whether there were other ties with Trump. There's no official word as to when the special counsel's office may conclude its work and, if it does, whether it might release findings other than those that have been included in the public court cases. Correct — and there might not even be a "report." The Justice Department's regulations call for Mueller's office to give the attorney general a "confidential" report when he completes his work, but new Attorney General William Barr doesn't have to release it. Other regulations call upon Barr to make certain notices to the House and Senate judiciary committees, but not for Barr to give them, or the public, the work product from Mueller. Barr has said he supports the idea of making public a report from Mueller's office, consistent with regulations and the law. Democrats say they worry about Barr not making an unconditional commitment to release something. There are proposals for Congress to pass legislation that would mandate that something goes out from the special counsel's office, but they haven't become law. He may not view that as his job — he's a former FBI director and a prosecutor. Mueller wasn't asked to write a narrative about the events of 2016 in the way that the 9/11 Commission was, for example. Mueller has a law enforcement perspective: He looks for whether there's evidence that a law was broken. Along the way, he has also revealed a great deal about Russia's influence campaigns against the United States, although not in a very user-friendly way: Everything has been in wooden indictments or court documents, with no easy-to-follow storyline from start to finish or aids such as charts or graphics. All the same, the court documents are public, and Mueller and the Justice Department may feel they're sufficient to get out the information they believe should be public. Barr hasn't scheduled one, but he could. He and other leaders in the Justice Department are sensitive, however, about the criticism that was leveled against then-FBI Director James Comey and the FBI in 2016 when Comey announced he would not recommend charges against Clinton. "If you're not going to indict someone, then you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person," Barr said in January. "That's not the way the Department of Justice does business." That may mean that Barr could simply announce that Mueller's work is complete but not entertain questions as to why Mueller decided not to charge certain people who've apparently been part of the Russia imbroglio. One aspect of the investigation that regulations specifically call for Barr to address with Congress is whether he, or potentially, one of his predecessors, turned down a request from Mueller for something. If the special counsel's office asked for authorization to try to subpoena someone, for example, and the leadership said no, Barr could communicate that to the House and Senate judiciary committees. No. The special counsel's office has partnered with other important parts of the Justice Department, including the U.S. Attorney's offices in Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Va. Cases underway could go forward under the auspices of those prosecutors. The prosecution of political consultant Roger Stone, for example, is being handled by the Washington, D.C., office. An investigation into Trump's inaugural committee is underway in the Southern and Eastern districts of New York. Former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who has been cooperating with the government, may serve as a witness for the prosecution in a case against his former business partners in Alexandria. Members of Congress also are continuing their investigations of Trump. The House and Senate intelligence committees are working on their own Russia investigations — although they likely do not have access to the same wealth of witnesses or material as Mueller does — and other panels, including the House oversight committee, also want to look into Trump's finances and other matters. If Barr or Mueller announce an end to the special counsel investigation, the next venue in this drama could be in Capitol Hill, but it's difficult to know what might happen without knowing what Mueller plans to do. In an extreme scenario, Mueller could write that he has uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing that includes Trump, setting the table for a debate over impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. Mueller also could give the president an important shot in the arm if the special counsel's findings dissipate the Russia cloud that has been looming over the White House. Or if Mueller does something in between — or he or the Justice Department complete a document they want to keep from becoming public — that could set up a political battle. If members of Congress get a classified report that they're asked to keep secret, for example, they might duel over whether to release it. Or if the Justice Department completes something it doesn't even want to give to Congress, lawmakers might vie over whether to compel Barr to reveal it. Mueller and his staff members also might become the most sought-after witnesses for a congressional hearing since Comey. There could be a separate disagreement about whether they actually appear. The political stakes, as they have been since the beginning of the Russia investigation, couldn't be higher. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor
---split---14.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/trump-mueller-report---split---President Donald Trump at the Capitol on the night of his State of the Union address earlier this month. Is Trump the political equivalent of Harry Houdini? Shapiro is skeptical. (Doug Mills/The New York Times POOL PHOTO) OPINION — Both CNN and The Washington Post ran stories Wednesday stating that Robert Mueller will deliver his secret report to the Justice Department next week or soon thereafter. While prior predictions of Mueller’s schedule have had the accuracy of a Revolutionary War blunderbuss, the latest timetable makes intuitive sense. Mueller must be keenly aware of the errors that James Comey made with his interventions during the 2016 campaign — and March 2019 is far from the 2020 Democratic primaries, let alone the presidential election. William Barr, whose work with Mueller dates back to the late 1980s, is now installed as attorney general. And, of course, Democrats are wielding the gavels in all House committees. As Garrett Graff points out in Wired, the form that the Mueller report could take ranges from a rich novelistic narrative like the Starr Report to a simple letter to the attorney general stating that the investigation is completed and no further charges will be filed. In truth, the more likely outcome is a legalistic middle ground that explains Mueller’s prosecutorial decisions and offers a roadmap for future proceedings against the president and his closest advisers, including family members. Even though Barr during his confirmation hearings consistently balked at promising that he would release the full Mueller report, efforts to shroud it in bubble wrap will probably fail. Whether the report is successfully subpoenaed by House Democrats, leaked to the press, emerges from unsealed court documents or is summarized by Mueller himself in congressional testimony, voters will almost certainly know the hidden secrets of the investigation sometime this year. Then what? It would be one thing if Mueller has unearthed a contract and a photograph of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, surrounded by 2013 Miss Universe contestants in Moscow, celebrating their agreement to collude to elect a reality-show host as president. While both Mueller and Trump have — in distinctly different ways — displayed an endless capacity to surprise, it strains credulity to believe that anything that overt exists in the files of the independent counsel. More likely, but far from certain, is that Mueller has assembled a complex daisy chain of evidence that points to the conclusion that Trump or his immediate family played Russian Roulette during the 2016 campaign. And Mueller may have unearthed major new evidence about Trump’s efforts to thwart the Russia investigation beyond his known threats, tweets and Oval Office bluster. Watch: 18 times Trump mentioned WikiLeaks Would such findings move the needle? Commentators such as CNN’s Chris Cillizza argue, “No matter what is in the Mueller report — literally, NO MATTER WHAT — it won’t change the minds of most people following the story.” (The Trumpian capital letters are Cillizza’s.) This can be summarized as the “even nuclear war with Denmark won’t change Trump’s numbers” theory. The idea is that the president’s nonstop attacks on Mueller, the FBI and virtually every law enforcement official this side of sheriff of Mayberry, North Carolina, have taken their toll. Everything in the Mueller report would be seen through a partisan lens. But I am skeptical that Trump is the political equivalent of Harry Houdini, an escape artist who would emerge snarling even if Mueller chained him in a cage under water. I prefer to believe that there are Republicans who will abandon Trump much as their predecessors bailed on Richard Nixon. When the Mueller report comes out, I will be watching orthodox Republicans like Lamar Alexander, who has announced that he will not be running for re-election to the Senate in 2020. Already, Alexander is taking advantage of his political independence with a statement describing Trump’s trumped-up declaration of national emergency as “unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution.” Alexander also has a unique perspective on presidential misconduct as the last veteran of the Nixon White House holding major political office. Lamar! — as he called himself during his two failed presidential bids — prudently resigned as a youthful Nixon aide to return to his native Tennessee before Watergate. Watergate also carries historical resonance for Larry Hogan, Maryland’s moderate GOP governor. The governor’s father, Larry Hogan Sr., was among the six Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who in 1974 voted for Nixon’s impeachment. As Hogan contemplates a primary challenge to Trump in 2020, the governor’s decision may be shaped by the tenor of the Mueller report. A strong case by the special counsel may prompt Hogan to uphold family tradition by challenging a badly tarnished president of his own party. Democrats will also face a choice if the Mueller report offers many troubling and tantalizing revelations but (to stick with the Watergate argot) no “smoking gun.” Obviously, there will be strong pressure from within the party — especially from the presidential contenders — to begin immediate impeachment proceedings. But enough congressional Democrats — particularly those who are not making weekend trips to Iowa and New Hampshire — remember the political folly of the GOP’s heedless vote to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998. Unless Mueller’s findings are unequivocal, prudence may call for House Democrats to hold lengthy investigative hearings to build an ironclad case for removing the president from office. If Mueller’s from-Russia-with-love report is indeed being written at this moment, we know what the dominant political questions will be all through 2019. “What did the president do and when did he do it?” Walter Shapiro has covered the last 10 presidential campaigns.

Mueller has a law enforcement perspective: He looks for whether there's evidence that a law was broken. Along the way, he has also revealed a great deal about Russia's influence campaigns against the United States, although not in a very user-friendly way: Everything has been in wooden indictments or court documents, with no easy-to-follow storyline from start to finish or aids such as charts or graphics. All the same, the court documents are public, and Mueller and the Justice Department may feel they're sufficient to get out the information they believe should be public. Barr hasn't scheduled one, but he could. He and other leaders in the Justice Department are sensitive, however, about the criticism that was leveled against then-FBI Director James Comey and the FBI in 2016 when Comey announced he would not recommend charges against Clinton. "If you're not going to indict someone, then you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person," Barr said in January. "That's not the way the Department of Justice does business." That may mean that Barr could simply announce that Mueller's work is complete but not entertain questions as to why Mueller decided not to charge certain people who've apparently been part of the Russia imbroglio. One aspect of the investigation that regulations specifically call for Barr to address with Congress is whether he, or potentially, one of his predecessors, turned down a request from Mueller for something. If the special counsel's office asked for authorization to try to subpoena someone, for example, and the leadership said no, Barr could communicate that to the House and Senate judiciary committees. No. The special counsel's office has partnered with other important parts of the Justice Department, including the U.S. Attorney's offices in Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Va. Cases underway could go forward under the auspices of those prosecutors. The prosecution of political consultant Roger Stone, for example, is being handled by the Washington, D.C., office. An investigation into Trump's inaugural committee is underway in the Southern and Eastern districts of New York. Former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who has been cooperating with the government, may serve as a witness for the prosecution in a case against his former business partners in Alexandria. Members of Congress also are continuing their investigations of Trump. The House and Senate intelligence committees are working on their own Russia investigations — although they likely do not have access to the same wealth of witnesses or material as Mueller does — and other panels, including the House oversight committee, also want to look into Trump's finances and other matters. If Barr or Mueller announce an end to the special counsel investigation, the next venue in this drama could be in Capitol Hill, but it's difficult to know what might happen without knowing what Mueller plans to do. In an extreme scenario, Mueller could write that he has uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing that includes Trump, setting the table for a debate over impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. Mueller also could give the president an important shot in the arm if the special counsel's findings dissipate the Russia cloud that has been looming over the White House. Or if Mueller does something in between — or he or the Justice Department complete a document they want to keep from becoming public — that could set up a political battle. If members of Congress get a classified report that they're asked to keep secret, for example, they might duel over whether to release it. Or if the Justice Department completes something it doesn't even want to give to Congress, lawmakers might vie over whether to compel Barr to reveal it. Mueller and his staff members also might become the most sought-after witnesses for a congressional hearing since Comey. There could be a separate disagreement about whether they actually appear. The political stakes, as they have been since the beginning of the Russia investigation, couldn't be higher. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

He vowed during his speech that "America will never be a socialist country." (Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks via Flickr) ANALYSIS | President Donald Trump is vowing to rid the Western Hemisphere of socialist governments, but the early days of his push appear as much about his own re-election fight than anything happening in Central and South America. “The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere,” Trump said to applause from an audience of Venezuelan-Americans Monday in Miami. “And, frankly, in many, many places around the world. The days of socialism and communism are numbered - not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and in Cuba, as well.” Trump was at Florida International University to try and pressure Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro to give up his grip on the country, and to give a boost to Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader that the United States and other world powers have recognized as the country’s interim president. Trump also warned Venezuelan military leaders he is poised to cut off access to funds they have stashed around the world unless they drop support for Maduro. [After contentious border moves, stakes only get higher for Trump] But the more Trump spoke Monday, the more he made clear his audience was not just governments and peoples in Central and South America, but audiences at home, as well. Here are three takeaways from the White House’s anti-socialism push, which began in earnest with Trump’s Feb. 5 State of the Union address. Familiar themes “The tyrannical socialist government nationalized private industries and took over private businesses,” Trump said of the Maduro government. “They engaged in massive wealth confiscation, shut down free markets, suppressed free speech, and set up a relentless propaganda machine, rigged elections, used the government to persecute their political opponents, and destroyed the impartial rule of law. “Socialism, by its very nature, does not respect borders. It does not respect boundaries or the sovereign rights of its citizens or its neighbors,” he said. “It's always seeking to expand, to encroach, and to subjugate others to its will.” Borders. Free markets. Rigged elections. Wealth confiscation. All are issues the president has used to attack Democrats at home and fire up his conservative base. “There are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States,” Trump said during a Feb. 11 campaign rally in El Paso, Texas. “So I again say to you — and I say it for the world to hear — America will never be a socialist country,” he said to applause.” Watch: Trump and Beto O'Rourke strike contrasting messages in dueling Texas rallies Republican reinforcements Three days after Trump’s warning about a perceived push for socialism at home and four days before he vowed to end it across the Western Hemisphere, the Republican National Committee provided some help in the messaging realm. The organization, which coordinates closely with the White House, blasted out an email with this subject line: “The Democrat’s Burgeoning Love Affair With Socialism”. Several of the bullet points below showed just how Trump and the RNC intend to fire up the conservative base by warning of Democratic plans to turn America socialist. [Trump says Mueller report release timing ‘totally’ up to Barr] “In just the last few years, Washington Democrats have developed a passionate love affair with socialism, highlighted by their adoration of the Green New Deal and single-payer health care,” the RNC wrote. It added, “2020 presidential candidates and prominent Democrats have cosponsored the resolution or expressed their love for the plan.” The deal proposes sweeping changes to the U.S. economy to — in large part — combat climate change. Democratic distancing The RNC also pounced on self-described “democratic socialist” Sen. Bernie Sanders’ announcement he is running for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination for a second time. “Bernie Sanders is going to force Democrats to lurch further to the left,” RNC President Ronna McDaniel told Fox News this week. “You’re already trying to see candidates out-Bernie Bernie. And the American people have to look at these radical ideas that they’re proposing.” White House and RNC officials are eager to try tying the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to Sanders and his far-left proposals. But some are not taking the bait. Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!  “I am not a democratic socialist,” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has distanced herself from the party’s progressive wing and its calls for a “Medicare for all” healthcare system. “It could be a possibility in the future,” she said recently. “I’m just looking at something that will work now.” But warnings about a perceived push for socialist policies at home already is a major part of the Trump team’s and RNC’s 2020 messaging plans. “Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it delivers division,” Trump said Monday. “Socialism is a sad and discredited ideology rooted in the total ignorance of history and human nature, which is why socialism, eventually, must always give rise to tyranny, which it does.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---18.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/politics/trump-kim-north-korea.html---split---Supported by By Mark Landler WASHINGTON — When President Trump meets North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, next week in Vietnam, his advisers hope to hammer out a road map for ridding the reclusive state of its nuclear weapons. But Mr. Trump appears more tantalized, at least for now, by declaring an end to seven decades of war on the Korean Peninsula. Those two goals, while not at odds, could result in a summit meeting that produces historic headlines but does little to advance the core American objective of eliminating North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Administration officials insisted Wednesday that disarmament remains Mr. Trump’s “overriding goal.” An American delegation recently visited Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, for preparatory talks with North Korean officials before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim sit down for their second summit meeting, on Feb. 27 and 28, and the officials said they were pushing for concrete steps by the North. But the president said recently that he was in no hurry to force North Korea to give up all of its weapons. Among the potential outcomes in Hanoi, according to experts briefed by the Trump administration, is an agreement that would trade a peace declaration for a North Korean commitment to open up and dismantle a handful of nuclear or missile facilities. Ending the war is a cherished goal of North Korea’s leaders because it would reduce their isolation and increase pressure to lift sanctions against the regime. But it raises troublesome issues for the United States, including whether it would hasten the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, a prospect that appeals to Mr. Trump. “What I worry about is the president may want the peace most — more than the denuclearization,” said Scott A. Snyder, the senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “I think we can see that tension; it’s on display in the senior administration comments.” The Trump administration has not discussed with Pyongyang pulling out the roughly 28,500 troops stationed in the South, according to two senior officials, and Mr. Trump’s top advisers uniformly oppose it. The president said this month that he had no plans to do so, though he noted that the troops were costly, and added, “Maybe someday — I mean, who knows?” As Mr. Trump meets again with Mr. Kim, his role as a peacemaker is clearly weighing heavily on his mind. The president has made no secret that he believes that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic outreach to Mr. Kim. He said it had halted the North’s nuclear and missile tests for more than a year, easing a deadly threat to neighboring Japan. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, nominated him for the prize, Mr. Trump said, though he added, “I’ll probably never get it.” Mr. Trump also claimed that his most recent predecessor, President Barack Obama, told him that he was on the verge of a military strike on North Korea, a claim that Mr. Obama’s former advisers have dismissed. Since Mr. Trump’s first meeting with Mr. Kim last June in Singapore — which produced extravagant claims of progress by the president but no evidence of disarmament — the administration has emphasized peace on the Korean Peninsula as a key goal of its diplomacy. It is one of four pillars of the administration’s engagement with the North, along with denuclearization, transforming relations between Pyongyang and Washington and obtaining the return of the remains of American service members killed in the war. “In President Trump, the United States has a leader who, more so than any previous president, is deeply and personally committed to once and for all bringing an end to 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula,” Stephen E. Biegun, the president’s special representative for North Korea, said last month in a speech at Stanford University. The thaw between North and South Korea has already eased tensions on the peninsula. On a visit to the Demilitarized Zone before Christmas, Mr. Biegun said, he was struck by how quiet and peaceful it was. “Not a weapon was to be seen,” he said. “Not even a sidearm.” Still, a formal peace treaty would raise complicated legal issues. For one, the Senate might assert its prerogative to ratify it. But the White House counsel’s office has told senators it does not believe a treaty would have to be ratified, according to a person briefed by the lawmakers. China is a signatory to the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement — along with North Korea and an American general, who was representing the United Nations Command — and it would presumably have to sign a successor treaty. The Chinese favor this course, in part, analysts warn, because they view it as a pretext to reduce the United States’ military presence in Asia. A peace declaration would also be attractive to South Korea’s progressive government, which is eager to expand its business ties with the North and increasingly views the war as a relic. “From the person on the street to the highest level of government, there is sort of this mood now that the war is basically over, so let’s just say it’s over,” said Victor D. Cha, an expert on Korea at Georgetown University who just returned from a visit to Seoul, the South’s capital. For Mr. Trump, he said, the question is: What can he get from Mr. Kim in return for such a declaration? North Korea could pledge to halt further nuclear testing and production, analysts said. But that would essentially preserve its nuclear capacity — and would look little different from the freeze-for-freeze arrangements that the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations negotiated with Pyongyang in previous rounds of diplomacy. It could also agree to open facilities to nuclear inspectors, and to dismantle some of them. South Korean officials point to the Sohae missile launching site, which is the near the North’s western border with China. A missile fired from that site in April 2012 scuttled the Obama administration’s “Leap Day” agreement with Pyongyang. These would be piecemeal gestures, far short of the comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization that administration officials demanded in the days leading up to the Singapore summit meeting. But they would keep Mr. Trump’s diplomatic efforts alive. “If you don’t want the negotiations to fail, you start to lower your standards,” said Mr. Cha, who negotiated with North Korea during the Bush administration. “You start to lower the bar.” North Korea has yet to provide the United States an inventory of its nuclear facilities, a prerequisite for any disarmament plan. Experts said they doubted that Mr. Kim would produce such a list in Hanoi, and said this was the most accurate gauge of the North’s intentions. “There is absolutely zero indication — none — that North Korea has any intention of being anything other than it has been, which is a nuclear-weapons state,” said Michael J. Green, the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Relations. Administration officials said they would push North Korea to take bold steps in Vietnam. And they noted that punishing sanctions remained in place on Pyongyang, even if analysts said China and Russia had relaxed their economic pressure since Mr. Trump’s diplomatic efforts had begun. The president may offer other enticements in Hanoi, like the opening in Pyongyang of a United States Interests Section, a shadow embassy that would symbolize a more normal relationship with North Korea. Even critics of the Trump administration said that, with Mr. Biegun negotiating with a newly appointed North Korean counterpart, Kim Hyok-chol, the United States was raising the right issues. The wild card is Mr. Trump — and his penchant for seat-of-the-pants negotiations. “One of the big worries that people have is that somehow the president is going to trade the alliance for the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize,” Mr. Snyder said. But he added that “by putting on the table the prospect of peace, we’re actually putting on the table a very significant lure.”   Advertisement

Yet opinions about the nation’s economy continue to be positive – and Trump’s handling of the economy remains a relative strength. Trump begins his third year with a 37% job approval rating; 59% disapprove of his job performance. Of five previous presidents, only Ronald Reagan had as low a job approval mark at this point in his presidency. (Reagan’s disapproval – 54% – was lower than Trump’s.) The new Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,505 adults, finds that a growing share of Americans say they trust what Trump says less than what previous presidents said while they were in office. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) say they trust what Trump says less than previous presidents, up from 54% last June and 51% in February 2017, shortly after he took office. The public also continues to fault the ethical standards of top administration officials. Just 39% rate their ethical standards as excellent or good, while 59% say they are not good or poor. While these opinions are little changed from last year, they are lower than evaluations of ethics of top officials for presidents dating back to Reagan. However, more Americans say Trump’s economic policies have made conditions better (40%) than worse (28%), while 29% say they have not had much of an effect. In January 2011, a comparable point in Barack Obama’s presidency, the public expressed mixed views of the impact of his economic policies, with about as many saying his policies made things worse (31%) as better (28%). And Trump engenders more confidence for his ability to make good decisions on trade and the economy than in other areas, especially working with Congress. About half say they are very or somewhat confident in Trump’s ability to negotiate favorable trade deals (51%) and make good decisions about economic policy (49%). By contrast, 40% have confidence in Trump on immigration policy and 35% are confident he can work effectively with Congress. (For more on views of Trump’s handling of the government shutdown, see “Most Border Wall Opponents, Supporters Say Shutdown Concessions Are Unacceptable.”) Trump’s presidency has been characterized by a favorable economic climate and that remains the case today. Currently, 51% say economic conditions are either excellent or good – among the highest ratings in nearly two decades. The surge in positive economic views has been driven by Republicans. Three-quarters of Republicans rate the economy as excellent or good, up from just 14% in December 2016, at the end of Obama’s presidency. By contrast, just 32% of Democrats offer positive ratings; Democrats are now less likely to rate the economy as either excellent or good than they were in December of 2016 (46%). The public’s perceptions of the availability of jobs have undergone a similar transformation. For the first time in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2001, a clear majority of Americans (60%) say there are plenty of jobs in their communities. And while these perceptions also are divided along partisan lines, majorities of Republicans (71%) and Democrats (53%) say there are plenty of jobs available locally. Yet favorable opinions about the economy and jobs have not been accompanied by a rise in public satisfaction with national conditions. For longer than a decade, no more than about a third of Americans have expressed with the way things are going in the country. Today, that figure stands at just 26%, down from 33% in September, with the decline coming among members of both parties. Among the survey’s other major findings: Low expectations for Trump’s legacy. About half (47%) think Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, compared with fewer (29%) who think he will be a successful president; 23% say it’s too early to tell. Ratings for Trump are more negative, on balance, than for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their administrations; in February 1995, more said Bill Clinton would be unsuccessful (34%) than successful (18%). Compared with his three most recent predecessors, far fewer say it is “too early to tell” whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful. Most Democrats want party leaders to “stand up” to Trump. As was the case a year ago, a majority of Democrats (70%) want their party’s leaders to “stand up” to Trump this year, even if it means less gets done in Washington; just 26% want them to try as best they can to work with Trump, even if it means disappointing some groups of Democratic supporters. A year ago, 63% of Democrats wanted their party’s leaders to stand up to the president. Among Republicans, the share saying Trump should stand up to Democrats has increased from 40% a year ago to 51% currently. Majority continues to say Trump has responsibility to release tax returns. As in the past, a majority (64%) says Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns; just 32% say he does not have a responsibility to do this. Nearly all Democrats (91%) – and 32% of Republicans – say Trump should release his tax returns. Public confidence in Mueller investigation steady. A majority (55%) remains confident that special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a fair investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. Confidence in Mueller has held steady over the course of the past year, and there remains more confidence in Mueller to conduct a fair investigation than in Trump to handle matters related to the inquiry appropriately.

---split---33.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/#interactive---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Most still want U.S. as top global power, but see China on the rise By Richard Wike, Bruce Stokes, Jacob Poushter, Laura Silver, Janell Fetterolf and Kat Devlin America’s global image plummeted following the election of President Donald Trump, amid widespread opposition to his administration’s policies and a widely shared lack of confidence in his leadership. Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election approaches, a new 25-nation Pew Research Center survey finds that Trump’s international image remains poor, while ratings for the United States are much lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency. The poll also finds that international publics express significant concerns about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it used to. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well, including the fact that, while the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago. Even though America’s image has declined since Trump’s election, on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% offer an unfavorable rating. However, a median of only 27% say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs; 70% lack confidence in him. Frustrations with the U.S. in the Trump era are particularly common among some of America’s closest allies and partners. In Germany, where just 10% have confidence in Trump, three-in-four people say the U.S. is doing less these days to address global problems, and the share of the public who believe the U.S. respects personal freedoms is down 35 percentage points since 2008. In France, only 9% have confidence in Trump, while 81% think the U.S. doesn’t consider the interests of countries like France when making foreign policy decisions. Critical views are also widespread among America’s closest neighbors. Only 25% of Canadians rate Trump positively, more than six-in-ten (63%) say the U.S. is doing less than in the past to address global problems, and 82% think the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making policy. Meanwhile, Trump’s lowest ratings on the survey are found in Mexico, where just 6% express confidence in his leadership. One exception to this pattern is Israel. After a year in which the Trump administration generated international controversy by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, his positive rating jumped to 69%, up from 56% in 2017. Around the world, publics are divided about the direction of American power: Across the 25 nations surveyed, a median of 31% say the U.S. plays a more important role in the world today than it did ten years ago; 25% say it plays a less important role; and 35% believe the U.S. is as important as it was a decade ago. In contrast, views about Chinese power are clear: A median of 70% say China’s role on the world stage has grown over the past 10 years. Still, by a slim margin, more people name the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power (a median of 39% say the U.S., 34% say China). And despite the unease many feel about the U.S. at the moment, the idea of a U.S.-led world order is still attractive to most. When asked which would be better for the world, having China or the U.S. as the top global power, people in nearly every country tend to select the U.S., and this is particularly common among some of China’s Asia-Pacific neighbors, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Australia. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to Aug. 12, 2018. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 use additional data from a Pew Research Center survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted from May 14 to June 15, 2018. Although perceptions of the U.S. are on balance positive, they vary considerably among the nations surveyed. Ten of the 25 countries in this year’s survey are European Union member states, and across these EU nations a median of just 43% offer a favorable opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, half or more in four of the five Asia-Pacific nations polled give the U.S. a positive rating, including 83% in the Philippines, one of the highest ratings in the survey. The U.S. also gets high marks in South Korea, where 80% have a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in President Trump has increased over the past year from 17% to 44%. As has largely been the case since Pew Research Center’s first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, attitudes toward the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa are largely positive, with Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans expressing mostly favorable opinions in this year’s poll. The three Latin American nations polled offer differing views about the U.S., with Brazilians voicing mostly favorable reviews, while Argentines and Mexicans are mostly negative. And the two Middle Eastern nations in the study – Israel and Tunisia – offer strikingly different assessments. The country giving the U.S. its lowest rating in the survey, and the place where the biggest drop in U.S. favorability has taken place over the past year, is Russia. Just 26% of Russians have a favorable opinion of the U.S., compared with 41% in 2017. A 55% majority of Russians say relations have gotten worse in the past year, and the share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53% to 19%. The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders, and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five. A median of 70% across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews. In contrast, opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive. Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU, although there are regional divides within Europe, with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe. European attitudes toward Trump are strikingly negative, especially when compared with the ratings his predecessor received while in office. Looking at four European nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently since 2003 reveals a clear pattern regarding perceptions of American presidents. George W. Bush, whose foreign policies were broadly unpopular in Europe, got low ratings during his presidency, while the opposite was true for Barack Obama, who enjoyed strong approval in these four nations during his time in office. Following the 2016 election, confidence in the president plunged, with Trump’s ratings resembling what Bush received near the end of his second term (although Trump’s numbers are up slightly in the United Kingdom this year). In several European nations, Trump receives higher ratings from supporters of right-wing populist parties. For example, among people in the UK who have a favorable view of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), 53% express confidence in Trump, compared with only 21% among those with an unfavorable view of UKIP. Similar divides exist among supporters and detractors of right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. However, it is worth noting that, other than in the UK, there is no European country in which more than half of right-wing populist party supporters say they have confidence in Trump. A common criticism about American foreign policy over the past decade and a half has been that the U.S. only looks after its own interests in world affairs, ignoring the interests of other nations. As Pew Research Center surveys showed, this belief was especially prevalent during George W. Bush’s presidency, when many around the world thought the U.S. was pursuing unilateralist, and unpopular, policies. Strong opposition to the Iraq War and other elements of Bush’s foreign policy led to rising complaints about the U.S. acting alone and ignoring the interests and concerns of other nations. Opinions shifted following Barack Obama’s election, with more people saying the U.S. considers their country’s interest, although even during the Obama years the prevailing global sentiment was that the U.S. doesn’t necessarily consider other countries. Now, the Trump presidency has brought an increase in the number of people in many nations saying the U.S. essentially doesn’t listen to countries like theirs when making foreign policy. This pattern is especially pronounced among some of America’s top allies and partners. For instance, while the share of the French public who believe the U.S. considers their national interest has not been very high at any point over the past decade and a half, it reached a low point near the end of Bush’s second term (11% in 2007), rose somewhat during Obama’s presidency (35% in 2013) and has declined once more under Trump. Today, just 18% in France say the U.S. considers the interests of countries like theirs when making policy. America’s reputation as a defender of individual liberty has generally been strong in Pew Research Center surveys since we first started asking about it in 2008. The prevailing view among the publics surveyed has typically been that the U.S. government respects the personal liberties of its people, and that is true again in this year’s poll. However, this opinion has become less common over time, and the decline has been particularly sharp among key U.S. partners in Europe, North America and Asia. The decline began during the Obama administration following revelations about the National Security Agency’s electronic eavesdropping on communications around the world, and it has continued during the first two years of the Trump presidency. The drop is especially prominent in Western Europe, where the share of the public saying Washington respects personal freedom has declined sharply since 2013. The same pattern is found among several other U.S. allies as well, including Canada, where the percentage saying the U.S. respects individual freedom has dropped from 75% to 38% since 2013, and Australia, where it has gone from 72% to 45%. Respondents to the survey were read a list of seven major nations, and for each one, were asked whether they think it is playing a more important, less important, or as important of a role in the world compared with 10 years ago. Among the seven countries tested, China stands apart: A median of 70% across the nations polled say Beijing plays a more important role today than a decade ago. Half or more in 23 of 25 countries express this view. Many also say this about Russia. A median of 42% believe Moscow’s role on the world stage has grown over the past decade, and majorities hold this view in Greece, Israel, Tunisia and Russia itself. Overall, people are split on whether Germany’s role is greater than it was 10 years ago or about the same, but many in Europe see Germany’s role as more influential. On the other hand, Europeans are particularly likely to think the UK is less important now. There is no real consensus in views of America’s prominence in world affairs. A median of 35% believe it is as important as it was 10 years ago, while 31% say it is more important and 25% say less. Japan is the only country with a majority saying that Washington plays a less important role. Meanwhile, Israelis, Nigerians and Kenyans are particularly likely to think the U.S. is more important than it used to be. In addition to being asked about whether major powers are rising, falling or staying about the same, respondents were asked the following question about whether they would prefer the U.S. or China to be the top global power: “Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world: the U.S. is the world’s leading power or China is the world’s leading power?” Results show that the U.S. is overwhelmingly the top choice. The U.S. is named more often than China in every country surveyed except three: Argentina, Tunisia and Russia, although in many nations significant numbers volunteer that it would be good for the world if both or neither were the leading power. Some of America’s allies in Asia and elsewhere are particularly likely to prefer a future in which the U.S. is the top global power. Two-thirds or more hold this opinion in Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK.  Findings from Germany, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Israel illustrate key patterns and major differences in how foreign publics view the U.S. in 2018. Germany stands out as a country where America’s image is considerably more negative today than during the Barack Obama era. Whereas Obama was extremely popular in Germany (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA scandal), only around one-in-ten Germans have voiced confidence in Trump in each of the past two years, ratings similar to those registered for George W. Bush at the end of his second term. Germany stands out on other measures as well. It is the country with the highest percentage (80%) saying relations with the U.S. have deteriorated over the past year, and it is tied with Sweden for the largest share of the public (75%) saying the U.S. is doing less to confront global problems. Germany is also where the biggest declines have taken place in recent years regarding the belief that the U.S. respects personal freedom and that Washington listens to other countries in international affairs. Mexico is where Trump gets his lowest ratings on the survey: Just 6% in the United States’ southern neighbor have confidence in him. Last year, more than nine-in-ten Mexicans opposed Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year, 66% in Mexico say relations have gotten worse over the past 12 months. Just 39% of Canadians express a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2018, the lowest percentage since Pew Research Center began polling in Canada in 2002. Only 25% have confidence in Trump, although he gets more positive ratings among those who feel closest to the Conservative Party (44%) than among those who identify with the New Democratic Party (17%) or the ruling Liberal Party (10%). Fully 82% say the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making foreign policy. Japanese trust in the U.S. president has also suffered under Donald Trump, but America’s overall image has not. In 2018, just three-in-ten Japanese say they have confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs, a slight improvement over their view in 2017, but significantly lower than their views of the U.S. president throughout the Obama administration. Opinion of Trump is comparable to sentiment about George W. Bush during his time in office. Fully 67% of Japanese, however, have a favorable view of the U.S., up 10 percentage points from last year. Despite the high ratings for the U.S., there are concerns in Japan about the trajectory of American power – it is the only country where a majority (55%) believes the U.S. is less powerful than 10 years ago. Confidence in President Trump has increased significantly in Israel since 2017. Trump also receives substantially higher ratings than Obama got near the end of his second term, although they are very similar to the high ratings for Obama in 2014, before tensions rose between his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. As has been the case in recent years, around eight-in-ten Israelis express a favorable opinion about the U.S. At 52%, Israelis are more likely than any other public surveyed to say the U.S. is doing more to address global problems than a few years ago. Israel also tops the list in terms of the share of the public (79%) saying that relations with the U.S. have improved in the past year. The rest of the report delves into these and other findings in more detail. Chapter 1 explores overall attitudes toward the U.S., America’s approach to foreign policy, whether the U.S. government respects individual liberty, and relations between survey countries and the U.S. Chapter 2 examines ratings for President Trump and other world leaders. Chapter 3 looks at opinions regarding whether specific major nations are playing a more or less important role in world affairs than in the past. Chapter 4 explores views about the balance of power between the U.S. and China, while Chapter 5 examines China’s global image.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we.
