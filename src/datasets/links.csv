---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/esquire-american-boy-cancel-culture.html---split---Supported by I’m a trans woman living in Brooklyn. And I have tremendous empathy for the conservative teen in Wisconsin. By Robyn Kanner Ms. Kanner is a writer and designer living in Brooklyn. I have an embarrassing secret. One I have long feared the internet would out for me. So allow me to out myself: In 2004, I campaigned for George W. Bush. To see me now — a trans woman living in Brooklyn, with “Infinite Jest” on my nightstand and “This Is America” on repeat — it’s hard to imagine me campaigning for Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney. But growing up, it could not have been a more natural choice. I grew up in Fairfield, Maine. My hometown has a population of 6,563. It is 97.5 percent white. I drank coffee out of plastic foam cups before school, and in the summer all the teens in my neighborhood would meet down at the Kennebec River and go fishing, even though the river was too polluted for us to eat what we caught. In a town that tiny you don’t pick your friends based on interests. It’s about who’s around. So when a fervent conservative friend asked if I wanted to campaign for Bush after cross-country practice I said of course. Standing on the sidewalk at the only intersection with a red light, we divvied up our signs and began to shout. “Bush for President! He’ll keep us safe!” I may have lacked a nuanced worldview, but I knew 9/11 wasn’t good. A man in a truck honked his horn in support. A woman rolled down her window and shouted: “No more war! Bring our troops home!” I was a naïve kid, happy to hang out with a friend. Fifteen years later, my views have changed dramatically. I voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and for Hillary Clinton in 2016. I believe that every person in America deserves health care. I don’t think we’re paying enough attention to the destructive damages of addiction. I’m terrified of climate change and believe we should end the use of fossil fuels. All my friends are gay. Still, I harbor an intense fear that part of my past will be used to invalidate the person I am now. I’m afraid of what my friends would think of my campaigning for Mr. Bush. Would I lose their trust? Would they fear that I secretly support war or xenophobic views? Would they believe me if I told them that campaigning for Mr. Bush was one impolitic moment on a long journey of understanding who I am? Things are far worse for Americans younger than me — those who don’t know a world without the internet. The one on my mind this week is Ryan Morgan, a 17-year-old from West Bend, Wis. He’s the cover boy of the latest issue of Esquire — the subject of a story called “An American Boy” by Jennifer Percy. Morgan is a white, middle-class teenager growing up in a conservative home with parents who support President Trump. He’s a sneakerhead who loves video games and the Green Bay Packers. He hates how politics are dividing his friendships. “Last year was really bad.” he tells Esquire. “I couldn’t say anything without pissing someone off.” In Wisconsin, white people account for 87.3 percent of the population. In the 2016 election, President Trump took all of the state’s 10 electoral votes. Ryan Morgan may not be the American boy some want, but he is the American boy who is. Still, his presence in Esquire sparked rage online. Zara Rahim, a spokeswoman for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, called out Esquire for running the story during Black History Month. “Imagine this same ‘American Boy’ headline with someone who looks like Trayvon talking about what it’s like to have your mother sit you down to tell you how to stay alive,” she wrote on Twitter. Others echoed the complaint. One can debate whether the article should have run a month earlier or later, or whether Esquire runs enough stories about teenage boys of color. But few if any of those criticisms actually engaged with the story itself: Was the portrait wrong? Did it add value to our understanding of America in this moment? While many in the press attacked Esquire, others went for Ryan Morgan. Some suggested he needed to be punched. Some suggested sending him hate mail. Others just swore. If in 2020, he chooses to go to college, the Esquire story and the reaction to it will come up during his interview. If in 2025 he finds himself online dating, it will be right there, on Google, for any potential dates to find. People change, pictures don’t. Katie Herzog is a gay journalist who knows exactly what it feels like to wear a digital scarlet letter. In 2017 she wrote an article called “The Detransitioners” for the independent Seattle newspaper The Stranger. In the piece, she reports on people who’ve transitioned to a different gender and then transitioned back. The piece was met with visceral hatred. Ms. Herzog received hate mail, including videos of people lighting her article on fire. I was part of the pile on. In a now deleted tweet, I called her “trash.” I feared that her piece somehow discredited my own identity. In fact, it was just adding nuance to a debate in queer culture. She agreed to get on a call with me after I apologized. “I don’t go to queer spaces anymore,” she told me. “My ex-girlfriend publicly called me out, and then when I saw her in public she just turned her back on me.” The reaction shook her. Everything in her life has changed since that article. “If I go out and order food, I’ll lie about my name.” And Katie Herzog is an adult with strong views about the world. Like myself at 17, the teenager on Esquire’s cover clearly doesn’t have strong political values or ideas; he seems to have adopted those of the people around him, maybe simply because he wants to fit in. Indeed, he talks about softening his positions to avoid being ostracized: “It’s better to be a moderate, because then you don’t get heat.” He is currently being shamed for being uninformed, for being a normal teenager. Digital shaming is arguably the only punishment that does not have a statute of limitations. Do we really want to live in a culture like this? Where no one has the room to grow or change or become a new version of him or herself? I’d like to think that the differences between me in 2019 and me in 2004 is a sign that we all can. The question is whether we can give one another the generosity to do so. Ms. Kanner (@robynkanner) is a writer and designer living in Brooklyn.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/magazine/north-korea-black-market-economy.html---split---Feature Far from the stereotype of total economic isolation, the black market has brought a surprising degree of modernity and consumerism — for some. CreditCreditIllustration by Sally Deng Supported by By Travis Jeppesen One Night in Pyongyang, around 9 p.m., my North Korean minder, S., and I pulled into the empty parking lot of the Chongryu Restaurant on the quiet banks of the Potong River. It was the spring of 2017, and, though I didn’t know it at the time, I was among the last Americans to visit North Korea before a travel ban took effect. It was my fifth trip in five years to the country, whose supposed impenetrability to American visitors had spurred me to visit as often as possible. On my first three visits, I traveled as an ordinary tourist, which was surprisingly easy to do (albeit in a highly monitored, regimented fashion); then, in the summer of 2016, I enrolled in a monthlong immersive Korean-language program at Kim Hyong-jik University of Education. Now I was back in the country to take an additional two weeks of language classes by day while covertly making further notes for a book in my hotel room at night. This was the second time that S., who was 26, had been assigned to look after me in less than a year; she had become something like a friend. Over the course of my visits, I learned that young couples often met for night strolls along this stretch of the Potong. “Are we here for a date?” I joked. S. laughed. “Yeah, sure,” she said. “We have a date tonight with Comrade K.!” K. — I refer to several key people in this article by their first initials to protect them and their relatives from reprisal — was the director of the state-owned travel company that arranged my visit. He had offered to take me out for a drink at his favorite gastro pub, in east Pyongyang near the Juche Tower, a 560-foot candle with a cherry-red flame kept constantly lit throughout the night. (The tower was built in 1982 on the orders of Kim Jong-il as a 70th-birthday present to his father, the North Korean founding leader Kim Il-sung.) In Pyongyang, a city that requires drivers to hold a special permit to be out past 11, 9 p.m. felt decidedly late. We climbed out of the car to take in the late spring nocturne. In addition to S. and I, there was our required second guide, P., as well as our driver. Usually, the tour guides are tasked with looking after large groups, but with all the bad publicity — North Korea’s relations with the West were at their worst, with missile launches and the imprisonment of an American college student named Otto Warmbier (who would later die after falling into a coma during his 17 months in North Korean custody) dominating the news cycle — tourism numbers, already low, had been plummeting. For the next two weeks, I would be the sole foreigner in their charge. Across the otherwise vacant parking lot, about a dozen figures were shuttling between the back of an open truck and the river, removing what appeared to be solar panels and carrying them to float upon the placid waters. I had begun to notice solar panels on apartment balconies throughout the city — a convenient solution to the country’s electricity shortages for those who can afford it — and knew that placing them in water was a way to cool them off. But owing to the great quantity here, it almost seemed as if the panels were being set afloat as a form of display, as if they were merchandise for sale. As I wondered what exactly it was I was seeing, P. shrieked out to her fellow Koreans: “Jangmadang! Jangmadang!” “Jangmadang! Jangmadang!” I echoed playfully. My minders ceased their laughter and looked down at the ground. They had forgotten for a moment that I was a language student; jangmadang was one word I was not supposed to know. Usually translated as “market grounds,” jangmadang is the word for the unofficial markets that emerged during the Arduous March, which is the regime’s official name for the famine that blighted the country throughout the middle and late 1990s. These were illegal markets, to begin with, that sprang up as a result of the collapse of the public food-distribution system that all North Koreans had previously relied on for their monthly rations. During the later years of Kim Jong-il’s reign, the government began to grudgingly accept their existence and took steps toward regulating them: charging rent for stalls, controlling prices and monitoring what goods were for sale. Under Kim Jong-un, the restrictions against this form of private enterprise have been all but lifted, and jangmadang has transcended the cramped market stalls of its birth to refer to the vast array of legal, illegal and semi-legal markets that exist for all sorts of goods in North Korea. Among recent defectors and expat residents, it is said that now, as long as you have money, you can buy anything you want in North Korea. But since the government still hasn’t figured out a way of publicly reconciling with this nascent form of capitalism, it was considered taboo to discuss the jangmadang with foreigners. Which is a shame, because the rise of the jangmadang is arguably the most significant milestone in North Korea’s recent history. It lies at the root of all the country’s economic development over the past few years. They might not be permitted to speak about it with outsiders, but North Koreans are no longer shy about flaunting their consumption habits, as anyone who has witnessed the displays on the streets of Pyongyang in recent years can attest. Montblanc watches, Ray-Ban sunglasses and Burberry couture hardly fit the stereotype of a half-starved populace completely cut off from the outside world. And while extreme poverty continues to afflict large swaths of the population, North Korean society no longer conforms to a simplistic picture of haves and have-nots, but is home to an increasingly diverse and complex array of socioeconomic classes. While the presence of a rising upper middle class is most apparent in Pyongyang, a nouveau riche strata has been observed in other parts of the country, such as the port city of Chongjin and in many places along the border with China, where licit and illicit trade continues to flourish. Stewing in awkward silence with my guides, I struggled to reignite the conversation but couldn’t come up with anything witty on the topic of solar panels. I was relieved from this lonely task by the appearance of a figure approaching the parking lot on foot, a 37-year-old man sporting a Dolce & Gabbana flannel shirt and a pair of neon Nikes. Were it not for the red pin bearing the smiling faces of Kims Il-sung and Jong-il installed dutifully over the heart — a pin that all North Korean adults are required to wear in public — he could, I realized, easily be mistaken for one of his compatriots from the South. “Comrade K. is here,” S. announced with a sigh. “Finally.” The Arduous March had many causes, but probably the main one was the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. During the decades following the Korean War, the Soviets provided North Korea with regime-sustaining aid, such as selling oil at artificially deflated prices in exchange for shoddily made North Korean goods. It made no sense politically, let alone commercially, for the Russian Federation to continue this form of aid-as-trade with North Korea. Between 1990 and 1994, annual trade between North Korea and Russia plummeted to $140 million from $2.56 billion, according to one estimate. In the following years, with flooding exacerbating the crisis, North Korea would experience a devastating famine that killed anywhere from 600,000 to more than a million people. With food scarce and the government unable to provide through its rationing program, North Koreans began turning away from the official, centrally planned economy. Markets sprang up all over the country, selling everything from food, cigarettes and household goods to illegal foreign media. According to Daniel Tudor and James Pearson’s book “North Korea Confidential,” the stalls were generally operated by middle-aged married women who were compelled to pay a “stall tax” to their local party cadre, “making the state complicit in marketization” — uncomfortably so. In 2009, under Kim Jong-il, the government implemented a disastrous currency reform, tried to close down the markets and forbade market activity within the country. This resulted in wide public discontent, and a high-ranking Workers’ Party official was executed as a scapegoat for the government’s decision. Still, the regime had failed in its promise to feed its citizens, and the gray markets of the jangmadang had, to some extent, filled in the gaps. Today there are more than 400 sanctioned markets in the country, representing about 600,000 vendors. After the currency reform wiped out the wealth and savings of a number of merchants, the preferred currencies in business became the United States dollar and the Chinese renminbi. According to one survey, some 90 percent of all household expenditures are said to take place in these markets; they are so pervasive that people speak of a Jangmadang Generation that grew up knowing nothing else. Under Kim Jong-un, market activities have not only been tolerated; they have slowly crept into the official sector, as I witnessed firsthand in my visits to the country. Among close observers, there is a growing consensus that the economy has been undergoing a quiet revolution. The South Korean economist Byung-Yeon Kim is among the first to offer hard data about what this transformation looks like, in his 2017 book, “Unveiling the North Korean Economy.” The average worker in North Korea’s informal economy, Kim reports, earns 80 times more than at an official job. Approximately 23 percent of employees at state-run enterprises are simultaneously involved with some unofficial form of business. At least 58 percent of all companies in North Korea employ so-called 8/3 workers, who pay a fee in order to be absent from work and engage in unofficial market activities; these funds are an important form of revenue for these companies, helping them to continue paying the salaries of their regular employees. This level of systemic corruption gets expensive: From 1996 to 2007, spending on bribes is estimated to have made up between 5.2 and 10.7 percent of total household expenditures. In spite of this endemic corruption, the North Korean economy was growing, by some estimates, at more than 4 percent annually before the latest round of sanctions went into effect in the fall of 2017. “The socialist economic system of North Korea has virtually collapsed,” Byung-Yeon Kim wrote. [Read more about North Korea’s growing economy in 2017] But this is a shift that has been hard to reconcile with the state’s self-image as a socialist paradise, which it continues to project to the outside world and its own people. Peter Ward, a Seoul National University master’s graduate whose research focuses on the North Korean economy, spent nearly a month traveling in North Korea last summer, perusing official government publications and academic journals. In the course of his research, he discovered that the state had issued new rules, lifting restrictions on the utilization of “order contracts,” so long as it agrees with the state’s objectives. Order contracts, Ward explained on a recent podcast, involve state-owned enterprises setting their own prices in consultation with customers. They are, in other words, market forces, but by another name. This change was not confined to any one sector, he explained; rather, supply-and-demand economics can be employed by management and staff members of state-owned enterprises in nearly every sector of the economy. At birth, every North Korean citizen is assigned a classification that is kept secret from them. This system is called songbun, and within it, there are three main categories — loyal, wavering and hostile — and 51 subcategories that serve as qualifiers. The assignation of songbun is meant to be the chief factor in determining the extent of a citizen’s lifelong opportunity. It is familial, based on what your parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were up to during the years of the country’s foundation — or even earlier. Those whose predecessors fought alongside Kim Il-sung in the guerrilla struggles against the Japanese occupiers of Korea before its 1945 liberation are endowed with the highest level of songbun; many of their descendants today occupy the highest echelons in the government. Those branded “hostile” might be the descendants of former landowners or of people who collaborated with the Japanese colonialists, those with relatives in South Korea or Christians; they are largely consigned to the mountainous, inhospitable regions of the country, forbidden to enter Pyongyang or other major cities and forced to eke out a meager living as farmers or manual toilers, with almost zero opportunity for further advancement. Even if most North Koreans don’t explicitly know what their songbun categorization is, everyone can generally intuit it, based on where they live, what their ancestors were known to have done, the degree of opportunities open to them and the level of discrimination to which they are regularly subjected from school age onward. Songbun, while a clear component of the police-state apparatus, has historically been tethered to the North’s traditional centrally planned economy. And there is evidence that as North Korea goes further in the direction of the free market, this political class system is eroding. Before my last trip to North Korea in 2017, I spent three months in Seoul interviewing North Korean defectors. One of them, Bomhee Kim, now 30, left the country in 2006. Throughout her childhood, which coincided with the famine years, she was able to observe firsthand how the songbun system began to unravel as the country did. It all began, she told me, with the death of Kim Il-sung on July 8, 1994 — as though, with the death of the Great Leader, a catastrophe of such cosmological proportions was inevitable. To Bomhee, a child of 5 at the time, this made perfect sense. People were taken to cry in mass displays of mourning before statues of the leader throughout the country. As if the gods were responding in kind, the skies opened and poured torrential rains across the land, ruining the year’s harvest. By 1997, the end of the three-year state-sanctioned mourning period for the eldest Kim, the tone of the propaganda under his son and successor, Kim Jong-il, had shifted to a message of struggle and endurance. In North Korea, salaried wages have always been so low as to be almost meaningless; all essential goods, including food, were meant to be provided by the state’s public rationing system. With Russia’s withdrawal of support, the rations quickly dried up. “My parents told me one day we would no longer be receiving food from the government,” Bomhee recalls. “We would have to struggle on our own from now on.” Bomhee remembers growing accustomed to the sight of corpses scattered along the ground in her hometown and the mountains, where people would go to forage for anything they could find to eat, including rats and tree bark. When the public distribution system broke down, the starving populace had no choice but to violate the constitution and go into business for themselves. With access to South Korea blocked by the heavily mined Demilitarized Zone, countless northerners fled over the border to China. The border also became a gateway to survival for those who stayed, with traders regularly crossing back and forth with food, goods and cash, as well as more illicit goods such as DVDs, effectively exposing North Koreans to the wider, wealthier world. Bomhee’s family lived close to a gold mine, and the country was corrupt enough by this point that if you knew the right people, you could buy directly from the miners. Her parents got unrefined gold at black-market rates, refined it at home, then sold the pure gold to Chinese investors over the border at the official rate, yielding a profit. Her father eventually started paying his boss a bribe rather than show up for work — with the economy broken, all industry had ground to a halt, so there wasn’t much to do anyway. Bomhee’s mother, meanwhile, began selling homemade food in the jangmadang. Video footage smuggled out of the North reveals these early markets as primitive gatherings on the muddy outskirts of large cities or else down discreet alleyways, merchants squatting or standing above their wares spread over tarps on the ground or gathered in homely sacks that could be readily snatched up should an official arrive. Kotjebi, homeless children whose parents had either died or abandoned them, self-organized into Dickensian gangs. They would stalk the market grounds, pickpocketing choice wares from shoppers’ knapsacks and distracting vendors while their comrades stole food, and they were often severely beaten or even killed in battles with warring gangs. Other lone children, some as young as toddlers, could be seen picking kernels of undigested corn out of piles of animal excrement to eat on the spot. When she was 11, Bomhee would ride her bike after school to a wholesale market and buy 100 pieces of candy for 1,000 won (around 12 cents, according to today’s unofficial but universally employed exchange rate), then join her mother in the jangmadang in the deep recesses of the countryside, where she would sell the candy and earn a 10 percent profit. North Korean socialism would never recover from this intrusion of market-based economics. While songbun has never gone away — a severely bad rating is still a huge hurdle to socioeconomic advancement — it is now becoming possible to work out from under it. Another young defector I spoke with, who asked not to be identified, was able to buy a permit required to stay in Pyongyang — certainly not thanks to her parents’ songbun, which was good but not great, but to their money and business connections. She grew up in a city on the Chinese border. Throughout the 2000s, when the border was much more porous than it is today, the markets there were thriving. The defector, who plays piano, dreamed of studying music in the capital. While her mother was doing very well in the markets, she couldn’t quite afford the $10,000 bribe that would place her daughter in the country’s top music conservatory. Instead, she negotiated a second-best deal directly with one of the professors, who, rather than show up for work, had begun teaching the children of elites privately. For a monthly boarding-and-tuition fee, she could live in the professor’s spare room and study piano in Pyongyang. According to a survey conducted by Byung-Yeon Kim among recent defectors, the average monthly salary for a state employee is a little under 2,200 North Korean won, around 26 cents; people working in the jangmadang, on the other hand, earned on average 172,750 won, about $21. (To help put those figures in perspective, the current price in Pyongyang for a kilo of rice is 4,200 won, or 51 cents.) And while it has traditionally been the case that defectors in the South send money home to their poor relatives still living in North Korea — a situation that mirrors that of Cuban émigrés living in the United States — I have heard from several defectors of a new phenomenon in recent years: wealthy North Koreans sending thousands of dollars each month to their defector children studying in the South. These people belong to the ranks of the upper-middle and upper classes, who aren’t merely selling goods in the jangmadang but conducting trade at globally competitive prices in industries like textiles and seafood. An individual employed in a managerial position at a state-owned company can, these days, engage in practically any profit-making endeavor he or she wants. These activities are “approved” by an official in one of the government ministries, essentially a business partner who takes kickbacks and who in turn pays kickbacks to one of his superiors, in a line that extends all the way up to the ruling family and their associates. Some journalists covering North Korea have compared the regime to a mafia protection racket. As our car crossed the bridge across the wide Taedong River into east Pyongyang, we stopped at a red light in front of a long building with a swerving rooftop. “This is the Ryugyong Health Complex, right?” I asked Comrade K. in the front seat. “Yes, yes,” he nodded. “But what about the one across the street?” I pointed to a newer building with a shiny blue-mirrored-window facade. “Is that also the Ryugyong? Or does it have a different name?” K. turned around to face me. “You’ve been there?” he asked incredulously. It is not a normal stop on the tours his company operates. In fact, he wasn’t aware that foreigners were allowed to visit. Indeed I had been there, on an earlier visit arranged by one of Comrade K.’s competitors. The amenities of the new health club were impressive. On the ground floor, a shop sold luxury goods: tailored suits, silk ties, fine leather wallets, glittering Rolex watches. A snack bar vended an array of imported soft drinks, including a range of Coca-Cola products with Vietnamese packaging. Contrary to the notion spread by some commentators that such sites are merely stage sets to impress foreign visitors, the two dozen customers in the men’s locker room that day appeared genuinely startled by the sudden appearance of me and the other male foreigner in my group who chose to partake of the facilities, which included a traditional Korean jjimjilbang, or sauna, far more luxurious than any I had chanced to visit in Seoul, and an indoor swimming pool replete with artificial waterfall. K. nodded pensively. “That is ... an extension of the Ryugyong Health Complex.” He chose his words carefully. “But the main building here with the sloping roof and indoor skating rink ... have you been there, as well? That one is for ordinary people.” I had begun to hear this term “ordinary people” with increasing frequency on my last two visits. Usually deployed with a twinge of derogation, it clearly connoted the underclass: the working poor, farmers and laborers, those not fortunate enough to be employed in an arena that would otherwise be considered gainful and prestigious, that might allow them entry into a place like the one across the street; people lacking the savvy and connections that might help them make it big in the gray-market world of the jangmadang or the managerial gentry of the state-owned enterprises. We pulled into a parking lot. A staircase between a shop selling imported prescription medicines and another offering a mishmash of clothing, furniture and household goods led up to our destination, Comrade K.’s favorite gastro pub, Taedonggang Beer Bar. It’s all polished wood, brass and chrome fixtures, tastefully dim lighting, bartenders in tuxedos. Were it not for the concert by Moranbong Band being broadcast on the flat-screen television in lieu of a ballgame, I might have imagined myself to be in an upmarket sports bar somewhere in Chicago or Boston. The reasonably robust crowd consisted of North Korean yuppies, their ties and Mao collars loosened after a long day at work. There is a local name for these people: the donju, or money masters. These are certainly not “ordinary” people, though they represent an increasingly sizable segment of the Pyongyang populace, on a tier just below the elites: the nouveau riche. They are not likely to be manning market stalls but collecting rent from them, as well as engaging in other jangmadang economic activity while nominally employed in the official sector: from overseeing the logistics of transporting goods smuggled in from China to running shops and businesses through which such goods might be distributed at a profit. My minders and I commandeered a table while Comrade K. went to the bar to order beers and a kimchi pancake. Though still nominally a tour guide, S. was recently promoted to a managerial position. I asked her what she did all day when there were no tours to lead, which, these days, was pretty much always. S. smiled coyly and said: “Oh, sit around, figure out new ways to kill time. Some of the guys in the office are becoming very skilled at World of Warcraft.” Like most North Koreans I met, she didn’t want to go into too much detail about what she did at work all day, but I had patched together my own hazy picture based on what she let slip on my previous visit to the country, as well as her endlessly buzzing smartphone. S.’s family was far from ordinary. Her father, whom she described as a “businessman,” had spent many years living abroad at a North Korean Embassy (as had Comrade K.). Both she and her father made occasional trips abroad to China, Africa and Latin America (as did Comrade K.). Her mother, a chef, ran her own restaurant, specializing in European and American cuisines, and offered catering services. At one point, S. asked me flat-out if I knew any businesspeople in Germany, where I currently live, of a riskier disposition who might not totally mind violating sanctions. I asked her what line of business she was interested in pursuing. Off the top of her head, she mentioned French cosmetics, I.T. services (her brother, she told me, was a genius programmer), human hair for wigs. “Anything, really,” she said. After Kim Jong-un inherited the throne in 2011, the central policy of his government was the so-called byungjin line: the simultaneous development of both the economy and the military (i.e. nuclear weapons). This was in many ways a continuation of his father’s military-first policy, which not only increased the size of the country’s standing army but elevated its top brass to a position of unprecedented power. But in April of last year, at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, Kim made a startling announcement: The byungjin line was officially dead. The development of nuclear weapons was complete and had been “victorious.” While outsiders continue to debate to what extent Kim intends to denuclearize, it’s notable that his spring announcement was followed by a reshuffling of military personnel at the top, implying a certain discord within the ranks around Kim’s decision, as well as a general downgrading of the military apparatus. Kim went on to declare that the sole focus, moving forward, would be the development of the economy, while engaging in a diplomatic process to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Besides his brief meeting in Singapore with Donald Trump, Kim has to date met three times for lengthy meetings with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. Moon has stated, repeatedly, that he believes Kim’s intentions to be sincere. [A guide to Trump and Kim’s next summit meeting.] It is notoriously difficult to know what the regime wants, but between the economic liberalization and the shifts in foreign policy, the upbeat interpretation is that Kim wants to open up North Korea. Bruce Cumings, a professor at the University of Chicago who has written a number of books on modern Korean history, is particularly sunny on the matter. “For the first time in North Korean history, I’m starting to believe that Kim Jong-un is moving in the direction of what Deng Xiaoping did in 1979 in China,” he told me. “I think his aspiration is create a secure environment in which North Korea can open up to the world economy in the way that China and Vietnam have. That’s very much behind the diplomacy with South Korea that’s been going on since January and the diplomacy with the U.S. I think this has actually been the North Korean goal for the last 25 years, but they found it very difficult to articulate it: some way to bring the U.S. in to solve their strategic problem after the Soviet Union collapsed.” For the economy to grow meaningfully, the North Koreans would need the United States and the United Nations to lift economic sanctions, allowing the country to access goods and, crucially, capital. But for this very reason, many are deeply skeptical of Kim’s motives, with hawkish North Korea watchers believing the United States is being suckered into lifting sanctions in exchange for nothing. The question remains whether the monolithic North Korean political system can survive the disruptive force that a market economy poses. The key to the equation might be the donju, who have made themselves an integral part of a complex financial system. Given the paucity of hard data released by North Korea, it is difficult to gauge just how many belong to this rising economic class. One thing is clear, however: Just as Kim has come to rely on the donju, the donju rely on the survival of Kim’s regime. The Russian-born North Korean-studies scholar Andrei Lankov believes that, unlike the upper-middle classes whose discontent with the system played such a pivotal role in the Soviet Union’s downfall, the donju fear that the collapse of the North Korean government and subsequent reunification of the Korean Peninsula would mean having to compete with the global economic behemoths of South Korea, leaving the Northerners with second-class status, or worse. Fully cognizant of the poverty that surrounds them — and the fact that many of them started off as “ordinary” people — it is in their interest that the current status quo be maintained. In this situation, the donju can hardly be thought of as a dissident class; they just want the state to lay off them so that they can get rich. After a round of beers, Comrade K. apologized and said he had to cut the night short. He had to leave the next morning on a business trip to Nampo. Before we all got up to leave, he presented me with a gift: an expensive lighter emblazoned with the Chollima, a winged horse from Asian mythology renowned for its amazing speed of flight. It was invoked by Kim Il-sung in the Chollima Movement of the late 1950s. Similar to the Great Leap Forward in China and the Stakhanovite Movement in the Soviet Union, the Chollima Movement was a mass labor campaign meant to spur rapid economic advancement via “ideological incentives,” such as Chollima Rider titles bestowed on those who exceeded their quotas. Among other tactics, the government encouraged workers to drink less soup so as to take fewer bathroom breaks. The Chollima Movement was lauded as a historical milestone in North Korea, but some outside observers have claimed that it resulted in little more than an exhausted, undernourished populace and an array of shoddy, inferior products and that it was yet another example of the government’s legacy of economic ineptitude. K. also handed me a green carton of cigarettes. “This is the new trend brand here in Pyongyang,” he said with a smile, then, lowering his voice: “The brand that the elites smoke.” I read the name of the company that makes them aloud: “Naegohyang.” My hometown. At the cash register, I tried to pay, but Comrade K. waved his hand, removed a thick wad of $50 bills from the breast pocket of his Dolce & Gabbana shirt, peeled one off and slapped it down. The hostess’s fingers danced across her pocket calculator, and she returned his change in a combination of dollars and a few thousand worth of won notes featuring Kim Il-sung’s smiling face. With a scowl, Comrade K. pocketed the dollars, slid the won across the table back to the hostess and sauntered out to the parking lot, where our driver was waiting.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/beto-orourke-take-wall-el-paso-mexico---split---Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, said that if it were up to him, he would tear down the border fence separating his hometown of El Paso, Texas, from Mexico. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Potential 2020 presidential candidate and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke said Thursday that if it were up to him, the border barrier separating his old El Paso, Texas, district from Mexico would come down. “Yes, absolutely. I’d take the wall down,” the Texas Democrats said in an interview on MSNBC, on the American side of the border wall with a view into Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. In his State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump touted the border barrier in El Paso for making the city safer. “Walls work,” the president claimed, invoking El Paso, though he did not cite any statistics to support his theory that the barrier in El Paso had an impact on crime rates. Crime rates in El Paso since 1985 have been well below the national average for large American cities, FBI statistics show. The violent crime rate in the Texas border city has been steadily decreasing since the early 1990s, with no discernible difference in the rate dropping since the 57-mile border fence went up in 2008. In fact, violent crime slightly increased between 2007 and 2010 but has mostly been on the decline since, statistics show. Watch: Trump and Beto O’Rourke strike contrasting messages in dueling Texas rallies O’Rourke said that crossings at the southern border with Mexico become a hot political issue for the wrong reasons when people feel national and homeland security threats. Since the 9/11 attacks, politicians have fanned those fears with measures to turbocharge border security, O’Rourke suggested. “We do this, whether it is the war on terror, the war on drugs — we project our fears and anxieties to places like El Paso, to the U.S.-Mexico border, and punish the people who live here,” O’Rourke said. “There’s no reason to do that. But it is the fear and the anxiety that is stoked by people who should and frankly do know better that results in these policies,” he said. O’Rourke has not announced whether he will run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. He lost his challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms by 3 points.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/database-leak-details-chinas-oppressive-tracking-of-muslims-security-roundup/---split---The US government averted another shutdown when Donald Trump instead opted to declare a national emergency to fund his border wall dreams—a wall which raises huge privacy and security concerns and will cause more problems than it solves. As the country digested the national emergency, cybersecurity workers were still scrambling to clean up the security nightmare wrought by the longest shutdown in history. Amid all the border wall news this week, you’d be forgiven for missing that the president also signed an executive order creating the American AI Initiative. In an op-ed for WIRED, White House deputy assistant to the president for technology policy Michale Kratsios explained why AI strategy is a security issue. Speaking of AI, to combat the growing threat of deep fakes, a new tool uses the blockchain to monitor video for tampering and manipulation. A popular electric scooter can be hacked to speed up and stop. One in three Americans has been the victim of severe online harassment. A US Air Force defector allegedly helped Iranians hack America. If Russia really cuts itself off from the internet, as it has threatened, the unintended consequences would be far reaching. Oh, and it was also Valentine’s Day this week. We hope you didn’t buy an internet-connected sex toy—unless it was one of the few that meets basic privacy and security standards, or you’re really into exhibitionism. Likewise, if you use OKCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, or Jack'd, look out for some security lapses this months. And make sure you're staying safe on dating apps in general. The Uyghur Muslim population in China’s Xinjiang providence is under constant surveillance from the Chinese government. Uyghurs are forced to install spyware on their mobile devices, and accept Chinese officials invading their homes to live and observe their families. Hundreds of thousands have reportedly been sent to “re-education camps.” And those who are not interned are being tracked via facial recognition technology by cameras and GPS all over Xinjiang. This week, a security researcher found that Chinese company SenseNets, which allegedly facilitates that facial recognition tracking, had left a database containing the associated data completely exposed online. The researcher was able to watch as “6.7 million GPS coordinates were recorded,” according to ZDNet, which broke the news. The database revealed how the government tracks Uyghurs throughout their day, noting the names of locations they frequent, as well as GPS coordinates, all matched to highly personal information like name, date of birth, sex, home address, official identification card number, and more. Before realizing what he had stumbled across, the researcher alerted SenseNets that its server was exposed. The company then locked it down. “He now regrets helping the company secure its oppression tool,” ZDNet reports. According to former employees, Facebook tracks users it worries pose a threat to the company via their mobile apps. CNBC reports that the program is known as BOLO, short for “Be on the look out.” BOLO is a list of Facebook account holders who have made threats against the company or its employees. Security guards at Facebook offices are informed to watch out for these individuals, and other security personnel are, according to what the former employees told CNBC, empowered to monitor their location using the GPS tracking on their Facebook apps. That latter fact is what security consultants said sets Facebook apart from other companies that maintain similar threat lists. One of the former employees called the program “very Big Brother-esque." A Texas man who had been banned from owning guns for a period of two years, owing to a history of domestic violence, was found by police with a partially printed 3-D AR-15 rifle and a list of politicians he allegedly planned to kill. The cops arrested him. It was a clear example, authorities said, of criminals attempting to circumvent the law and legal background checks by building weapons rather than buying them—a potential popularized by gun-rights activist Cody Wilson, who WIRED has been following for years, and who was arrested on charges of child sexual assault last year. After the 2015 passage of the Iranian nuclear deal, under which Iran promised to destroy much of its nuclear program, president Barack Obama’s White House and the rest of the world were hopeful that Iran’s nuclear ambitions would be kept in check. Then last year president Trump backed the US out of the deal, and now The New York Times reports that his administration is “reviving” a secretive program to sabotage Iran’s weapons. Those efforts began under the presidency of George W Bush, and was continued by Obama until Iran’s nuclear activity severely waned after the 2015 nuclear accord. With the accord abandoned, the US is apparently accelerating its sabotage. The Times reports that in the last two months, “two Iranian attempts to launch satellites have failed within minutes.” Ever wonder, sitting in a college class as someone asks a less-than-brilliant question, how some of the students around you managed to get in? A current student at Stanford recently figured out that since 2015 any Stanford student who has requested to access their own admissions information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) could, if they tweaked the URL on their own data, view that of other admitted students. This error would let students reach each other’s admissions essays, see their test scores, ethnicity, and even whether they had applied for financial aid. The security flaw, as reported by Stanford’s student newspaper The Stanford Daily, was found in the third-party system the school uses to host scanned admissions documents. The school has now closed the breach, and will be telling 93 students that their information was compromised. It seems like every time you turn around there's a new breach of personal information.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/amazon-democrats-2020.html---split---Supported by By Trip Gabriel and Peter Eavis The decision by Amazon this week to abandon its planned headquarters in New York City tapped into one of the major themes of left-wing Democrats: that giant corporations — and in some cases the billionaires who run them — must be held to account for wage inequality, corporate greed and middle-class stagnation. And some contenders and would-be contenders for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination were quick to take a victory lap over the retailer’s sudden reversal. The economic incentives offered the company amounted to no more than “taxpayer bribes,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who accused Amazon of holding American democracy “hostage.” .@Amazon – one of the wealthiest companies on the planet – just walked away from billions in taxpayer bribes, all because some elected officials in New York aren't sucking up to them enough. How long will we allow giant corporations to hold our democracy hostage? https://t.co/O9pz7en43B Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has introduced the “Stop BEZOS Act” to tax companies that he says underpay employees, congratulated New Yorkers “for standing up to the power of Amazon.” Their blunt condemnation of Amazon underscores the extent to which this has become an animating issue for the far left. And their reaction is one act in a broader set of 2020 issues for progressive Democrats that includes the Green New Deal, which proposes far-reaching federal intervention in the economy to tackle climate change, and the determination to rein in leviathan tech companies, whose founders have lost their luster as heroes of a new economy. Candidates and potential candidates perceived as more centrist did not immediately weigh in, reflecting one of the fault lines in a Democratic Party wrestling over who is the best standard-bearer to suit up for a coming titanic struggle with President Trump. Some candidates, like Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have deeper connections to tech companies. The views of centrists may have been channeled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who slammed fellow Democrats for putting “their own narrow political interests above their community.” [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] The sudden unraveling of the Amazon deal on Thursday meant the company’s promise of 25,000 jobs in New York City would be unfulfilled over opposition to the city and state’s offer of $3 billion in tax incentives, which highlighted the practice of luring businesses to states and cities with promises of big tax breaks. “There are large questions philosophically about whether taxpayers should give billions of dollars to billionaires,” said Gordon Hintz, the Democratic minority leader of the Wisconsin State Assembly, who is a critic of a state deal in 2017 to lure the electronics giant Foxconn with $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies. “There’s frustration in the public right now where wealth is being concentrated, the opportunities for economic mobility are lower, and they see the people who receive these deals seemingly unconcerned with their reality,” he added. Wisconsin, a battleground state that Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016 as part of his appeal to white blue-collar voters, is certain to be a crossroads of national Democratic contenders ahead of 2020, as they try to win back some of those voters and excite others who stayed home. That Mr. Trump played a role in the Foxconn deal — and jumped in again recently when the Taiwan-based company wavered — is a ready-made target for Democrats inclined to criticize corporate giveaways. Mr. Hintz said the issue played a role in the re-election loss last year of Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. Even as New York sent Amazon packing, other cities and regions renewed their courtship of the company. On Thursday, Newark officials sent a courier in red to deliver a giant heart-shaped card to the company bearing the Valentine’s Day message that the city and New Jersey “still love u, Amazon!” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Mr. Booker, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, has made no comment on the deal. A Democratic county chairman in Iowa, Kurt Meyer, who put Mr. Booker up overnight on a recent swing through the state, predicted that criticisms of large corporations would feature in appeals to the party base there, which is more progressive than in many states. Iowa’s $208 million in incentives for an Apple data center near Des Moines with just 50 jobs was debated in last year’s midterm elections. “I suspect the issue will be exploited extensively in Iowa, due in part to our vague but distinct sense of economic insecurity, which, while unrelated to Amazon and Apple, is pretty dry tinder,” Mr. Meyer said. At a CNN town hall in Iowa last month, Ms. Harris was asked if the existence of multibillionaires was “morally defensible.” She replied that the 2017 Republican tax cut bill was “unconscionable” for giving breaks to corporations and those in the top 1 percent but excluding working families. Amazon’s decision to cancel its deal with New York also comes at a time when prominent Democratic lawmakers in Washington are crafting legislation and advocating policies that could constrain or even break up large technology companies. In the past two years, big scandals in the technology sector have made privacy and the security of social media networks hotly debated issues. Russian entities used Facebook’s network to try and influence the 2016 presidential election. The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Facebook users’ data had been misused. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and candidate for president, is sponsoring a bill that would require disclosure about who is paying for online political advertising. Ms. Warren supports antitrust policies. Mr. Sanders’s Stop BEZOS Act, named for the chief executive of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, would tax corporations whose low-wage workers find it necessary to rely on food stamps and government health care benefits. The push to step up regulation may have support among the public. In a Pew Research poll last year, 55 percent of the respondents said technology companies had too much power and influence, compared with 37 percent who said the firms had the right amount. But not every party official believes in shaming corporate chieftains and corporations. In northeast Ohio, Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat whose district recently lost 1,600 jobs with the shutdown of a plant making the Chevrolet Cruze, wrote a letter on Friday imploring Amazon to build a second headquarters there. Mr. Ryan, in an interview, predicted that everyone at the basketball game he planned to attend Friday night at Howland High School, where his daughter is a cheerleader, would be talking about how to lure Amazon and its jobs to the area. Ohio is a swing state that Democrats, including Senator Sherrod Brown, who is weighing a presidential bid, would like to win back in 2020. “It doesn’t serve us well to be hostile to business in general,” Mr. Ryan said. “We need them. We can’t reverse climate change. We can’t rebuild manufacturing. We can’t retool work force development without a partnership with the free enterprise system.” OpinionAmy Liu    Advertisement

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/republicans-have-concerns-about-trumps-executive-action-too---split---Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement Friday that the president's national emergency declaration defies the Founders. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Some in the president’s party are wringing their hands about how the emergency declaration for a border wall might set a reckless precedent. While Congressional Republicans have raised concerns, most held off on denouncing the president’s radical maneuver to circumvent Article I of the Constitution and devote federal funds to a border wall without their approval. They wonder how a future Democratic president could circumvent Congress on liberal spending priorities like the Green New Deal — the sprawling plan supported by Democratic progressives to address climate change by restructuring the economy and phasing out fossil fuels. Among the most stinging criticisms came from Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers. The Tennessee Republican said Trump's national emergency declaration is, "is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution" and the congressional power of the purse. In a statement, Alexander also called the declaration both "unnecessary" and "unwise." “It is unwise because if this president can declare a national emergency to build a wall, the next president can declare a national emergency to tear it down; or declare a climate change emergency to close coal plants and build wind turbines; or a health care emergency and force into Medicare the 180 million Americans with health insurance on the job," Alexander said. “It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses," said Alexander, the Energy-Water chairman. "The Constitution gives that authority exclusively to a Congress elected by the people.” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., former Republican conference chair, said the declaration could subvert the balance of powers between branches of government. She said she worries it could open the door to passing a Green New Deal by fiat. “If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?” McMorris Rodgers said in a statement. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., echoed that concern. “Today’s national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal,” Rubio said in a statement. Rubio did not say whether he supported or opposed an emergency declaration, but instead said he would “wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also held off on staking a position on the national emergency declaration, but underscored his support for the president’s wall push. “The Constitution grants Congress the authority to appropriate federal dollars, so I’m sure such action will be litigated in the courts,” Grassley said in a statement. “What’s clear, however, is that the president takes the situation at our border seriously and that Democrats do not.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in a Thursday statement that the president will sign a budget deal to avert a government shutdown. In the same statement, she announced the president would “take other executive action — including a national emergency.” According to White House aides, a national emergency declaration would grant Trump broad authority to redirect money appropriated to the Pentagon and U.S. Treasury in order to construct a border wall. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was concerned about how an emergency declaration would weaken the power of Congress to appropriate federal funds. It “strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the will of Congress and of being of dubious constitutionality,” Collins said in an interview with USA Today. Here are some of the other Republicans who have raised concerns about an emergency declaration for a border wall: Rep. Chris Stewart Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said a Democratic president could deem climate change or gun violence a national emergency in order to outmaneuver Congress on appropriating tax dollars. “Whether the president has the authority or not, it sets a dangerous precedent and places America on a path that we will regret,” he said. “It deeply worries me that a future Democratic president may consider gun violence or climate change a ‘national emergency’ and what actions they may then take.” Sen. Mitt Romney Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, supported the budget deal but said an emergency declaration is not the “right approach.” I'll reserve judgment on any potential executive action by the President until I'm able to fully evaluate it, but as I’ve said, I don't believe declaring a national emergency is the right approach. I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limits.  Sen. Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., supports a border wall, but the libertarian senator said he opposes the emergency declaration, which he described as “extraconstitutional.” “I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them,” Paul said. Rep. Will Hurd The Texas congressman and only Republican to represent a district along the southern border, said in an appearance on The View that about “1,000 landowners are going to be impacted. And guess what? They're going to sue.” Rep. Will Hurd on how landowners in his district along the border will react to the wall: "They're going to sue because in the great state of Texas, we care about a little thing called 'private property rights.'" https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/5811OdClp4  Rep. Mike Turner “I supported this funding deal as a step towards securing our border, which we absolutely must do. However, I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the President to be forced to declare a national emergency because Congress refuses to provide necessary funding to protect our country," the Ohio Republican said in a statement. "As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects.” Sen. Mike Lee The Utah Republican, who supports an originalist view of the U.S. Constitution, issued a gentle criticism of the president's Article I workaround on Twitter Friday afternoon. "My initial assessment is that what Pres. Trump announced is legal. Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter," Lee said. "Congress has been ceding far too much power to the exec. branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back."

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/they-think-northam-should-get-another-chance-its-complicated---split---Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has been doing a lot of learning this month — about blackface, apologies and redemption. African-Americans who believe he should stay in his post are used to making political compromises to survive, Curtis writes. (Alex Edelman/Getty Images) OPINION — The lessons of this February’s Black History Month commemorations have already veered far beyond the usual ones that begin and end by quoting a snippet of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech — the part about judging folks not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. A new curriculum is being written in real time, affecting real-life politicians and their constituents. And Virginia is hardly the only state not ready for the big exam. Of course, the politician in question, Gov. Ralph Northam, has been learning as he goes — about blackface, about apologies and about redemption. It is no surprise that those most qualified to teach forgiveness have been the African-American citizens of his state. They have had lots of practice since the first enslaved people were brought to Virginia 400 years ago. A Washington Post poll shows that most believe he should stay in his post and do the job he was elected to do. Part of that may be “better the devil you know.” But it is also clear in several stories published about his own history that the motivation of those who think Northam has made the right decision in choosing not to exit quietly is more complicated than that. Friends of every race who have known Northam since he grew up on Virginia’s Eastern shore paint the picture of a man who was a good, fair and friendly classmate in a high school that changed from white to majority black after desegregation was finally implemented years and lawsuits after 1954’s Brown v. Board of Education. That decision led to massive official resistance to integration. Virginia closed its public schools rather than comply, leaving white students to enter segregated academies and black student to fend for themselves. Also watch: Trump calls on Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign The personal and public kindnesses of Northam through high school and then college at Virginia Military Institute stood out for many who spoke with reporters. They are saddened by the caricature that has spawned outrage and Saturday Night Live skits. Reverend King also once said, “It is appalling that the most segregated hour of Christian America is 11 o’clock on Sunday morning.” Though that still holds true in many communities, Northam and his wife attend a church congregation with mostly black worshippers, led by a black pastor. That’s not saying the embattled governor deserves a medal for acting like a human being. It is understandable that some of those voters who supported him feel betrayed. When Northam said he did not become aware until a few years ago of the pain of blackface — and when Attorney General Mark Herring confessed to his own moment imitating rap artists all too authentically — it was difficult to believe that they reached adulthood that clueless. But then it wasn’t. Teachers, schools and parents are still letting children of all races down when they skip over inconvenient history, when textbooks call enslaved people “workers,” “immigrants” and “indentured servants,” as Northam himself did on CBS and was quickly corrected by Gayle King. The morning anchor, who is African-American, would not have ascended to her prestigious job with so many blank spaces where knowledge should be. But it is still possible for white Americans to become a governor or attorney general or a CEO and have no idea about African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans and Native Americans, their histories, contributions and struggles, and the advantage that gave white citizens. It helps explain the inequities in wealth, housing, education and job opportunities whose effects persist long after slavery and Jim Crow. There is a reason some die-hard Cleveland Indians fans cling to the grinning Chief Wahoo and Covington Catholic school boys and their teachers thought war whoops and tomahawk chops were harmless fun. Which brings me, and all of us, to the president of the United States and Republican politicians in Virginia and beyond, who are enjoying the spectacle — popcorn in hand — of Democrats imploding in a state that had been trending blue. While Northam, however clumsily, is calling for learning and healing, the GOP looks eager to shut it and the governor down. It’s not that they are champions of liberty, justice and equal opportunity for all. In fact, when Donald Trump, looking to take advantage, took to Twitter to sow racial division by exploiting the scandals — and to compare the Democratic Party’s treatment of Northam, Herring and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who has denied sexual assault charges by two women — Twitter roared back, reminding the president of his own road to the White House, paved with birtherism and racist insults. There is plenty of evidence, from housing discrimination lawsuits that padded the Trump fortune, to administration policy that separated parents from children and then lost track of them, to a recent possible reference to the Trail of Tears to score points on an opponent (and the current president’s worship of that policy’s father, President Andrew Jackson, for whom the removal of Native Americans from their land was a priority). Republicans may pull Iowa Rep. Steve King from committees as payment for his vocal support of white nationalist ideals, but the congressman remains in his U.S. House seat. The African-Americans who want to give Northam another chance are used to the compromise needed to survive. In this case, a governor who champions voting rights and Medicaid expansion looks pretty good compared with a GOP moving in the other direction. And most Virginians of any race realize that Republicans, like Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, managing editor of a 1968 VMI yearbook sprinkled with blackface photos and racist slurs, have less than pristine racial pasts. Every February, someone asks why we need a Black History Month. And every February, and the rest of the year, comes the proof of the price each American pays for playing politics instead of putting aside the inconvenient conversations that may cause pain, but ultimately will keep the country from making the same costly mistakes over and over again.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/italy-five-star-movement-techno-utopians/---split---On the night of Italy’s 2013 parliamentary elections, Paola Nugnes decided to stay late at her office and catch up on work. She skipped the rolling election coverage on TV. And by the time she finally left her architecture studio to go out, it was well past dark. When she arrived at Mumble Rumble, a nightclub in western Naples, at around 9 pm, Nugnes still hadn’t checked the news. The club was hosting a party for activists in a political movement Nugnes had been part of for the past six years. And as she walked in, the crowd erupted. Nugnes asked if her friend Roberto Fico, the most famous local figure in the group, had won his race for a seat in Parliament. But before anyone could answer, a pack of journalists pounced, thrusting microphones in her face: “How do you feel about being elected?” Nugnes stared at them, dumbfounded. That’s how she found out she was now a senator. Along with hundreds of other political rookies, Nugnes had run for office under the banner of something called Five Star, an online phenomenon whose explosive, organic rise was shocking even to those it had just swept into power. Just a few years before, in the mid-2000s, the movement had been little more than the fan base of a blog fronted by a foulmouthed comedian, Beppe Grillo; from there it became an earnest protest movement organized around Meetup.com groups called Friends of Grillo; then it had unified under the name Five Star in 2009. The movement tapped deeply into one of the most powerful forces in Italian politics: disgust with Italian politics. Rather than offer an ideology or platform, Five Star offered a wholesale rebuke of the country’s entrenched, highly paid, careerist political class—left, right, and center. And it married that disdain to a grand techno-utopian project: Through an online voting and debate portal, Five Star was building a direct democracy on the internet. The long-term goal was to replace Parliament altogether—to automate it out of existence. But in the meantime, Five Star had also decided to displace the establishment seat by seat. How Trump Could Wind up Making Globalism Great Again The Political Education of Silicon Valley Why Tech Worker Dissent Is Going Viral The 2013 election was Five Star’s first foray into national politics. While a handful of its candidates were expected to win their races, Nugnes highly doubted she would be one of them; she barely gave it a thought, in fact. So Nugnes had worked through the evening, while the rest of the country reeled from the news that Five Star was now Italy’s second-biggest party, having swept 25 percent of the vote, upending the political establishment in a single stroke. Amid the whirl of embraces and congratulations at the election night party, Nugnes struggled to think through the ramifications. “We were all very excited—and frightened,” she says. She would have to quit her architecture studio. “It was very traumatic,” she says. A couple hours’ drive up the coast, near Rome, Elena Fattori, a molecular biologist who was also active in Five Star, faced a similar bout of disbelief that night. “I had taken it all very lightly,” she says of her run for the senate—so much so that she volunteered to help supervise the vote count that day. As she watched the running tally, Fattori could see firsthand that Five Star was far exceeding expectations and, eventually, that she herself had been elected. “It was a shock,” Fattori tells me. “I took a couple of days to accept it.” All told, some 160 Five Star candidates with virtually no experience in politics became members of Parliament that day. This put the movement in an awkward position. Governments in Italy are normally formed via alliances between two or more parties that can command a majority of seats in Parliament; Five Star had won so many seats that it had the option of going straight into a governing coalition with the first-placed bloc, led by the center-left Democratic Party. But that was out of the question: One of Five Star’s founding principles was “no alliances.” And besides, the movement saw the Democratic Party as central to the corrupt establishment it had sworn to fight. So Five Star went into opposition. While Five Star sees itself as neither right- nor left-wing, much of the party’s base is left-leaning. Many of its voters and activists, including Fattori and Nugnes, were drawn to the movement after becoming disenchanted with the Democrats and other parties on the left. Nugnes, a woman with Marxist sympathies, had grown alienated from Italy’s communist parties, which she viewed as ailing, top-down institutions. “I felt like an orphan,” she recalls. Five Star, by contrast, was a “cultural revolution,” a horizontal movement that put governing directly in the hands of anyone who cared to log on. To the extent that Five Star did have a political platform, it vaguely resembled that of a Green Party. The movement’s name ostensibly refers to its first five policy priorities: sustainable transportation, sustainable development, public water, universal internet access, and environmentalism. Nugnes was particularly attracted to the movement’s more recent flagship policy, a universal basic income that proposed a monthly stipend of 780 euros (a bit less than $900) for Italy’s poorest citizens. In short: While the movement had always included people across the political spectrum, it was easily taken for a progressive popular front. Members of Five Star reeled at where their movement had ended up: tied to a party led by a man many of them regarded as a fascist. But if Nugnes and Fattori were shocked to become elected members of government, the next few years would be even more vertiginous. As the movement’s fledgling nonpoliticians found their feet in Parliament, they realized that dealing with other parties was unavoidable. At times, in opposing the Democratic Party–led government, Five Star found itself siding with another faction defined by antiestablishment roots—a right-wing populist party called Lega, or the League. Lega’s nativist leader, Matteo Salvini, had long campaigned on an “Italians first” platform. He has said that his country needs a “mass cleansing” of illegal immigrants, “street by street, district by district, piazza by piazza.” When Italy’s 2018 national elections came around, Five Star—whose emphasis on popular sovereignty had, at times, come to sound sympatico with anti-EU, anti-immigrant sentiment—won so many seats that it became the largest party in Italy. This time, the movement didn’t shy from stepping up to run the country. And it chose to do so in partnership with Salvini’s Lega. Last September, Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump and would-be pied piper to Europe’s ethno-nationalists, visited Rome to celebrate the alliance. Of all the countries he had visited in his recent travels, he singled out Italy as “the center of the political universe.” The new government there was a Bannonite dream come true: a left-right, antiestablishment coalition. “A populist party with nationalist tendencies like the Five Stars, and a nationalist party with populist tendencies like the League,” he enthused to Politico’s European edition. “It’s imperative that this works, because this shows a model for industrial democracies from the US to Asia.” While Bannon gushed, members of Five Star like Nugnes and Fattori reeled at where their movement had ended up: tied to a party led by a man many of them regarded as a fascist. They were also beginning to realize that Five Star’s evolution had never been as organic as it seemed. At every step along the way—from the creation of Grillo’s blog and the organization of the movement’s first mass protests to the construction of its direct-democracy platform, all the way to its recent turn toward nativist politics—Five Star’s course had been meticulously directed by a camera-shy cyber-utopian named Gianroberto Casaleggio, the movement’s cofounder. Casaleggio, who died of brain cancer in 2016, was, in some ways, a familiar type. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he and a slew of other Internet Age prophets—many of them writing in this magazine—foretold a digital revolution that would flatten the priesthoods of politics, government, and journalism, and replace them with decentralized webs of direct participation. But Casaleggio, unlike his fellow pundits, actually went on to mount a revolutionary force that took over a country. Not only that, he directed this supposedly leaderless movement while drawing barely any attention to himself. So here’s the mystery at the heart of Five Star: Who the hell was Gianroberto Casaleggio—and how did he do it? Gianroberto Casaleggio: Cofounder and intellectual father of the movement. Beppe Grillo: The movement’s cofounder and front man. Luigi Di Maio: A Casaleggio protégé, elected the leader of Five Star in 2017. Alessandro Di Battista: Another Casaleggio protégé and one of the movement’s most visible members. Roberto Fico: Unofficial leader of Five Star’s left wing. Paola Nugnes: Left-wing Five Star senator who has been critical of the movement’s rightward turn. The small city of Ivrea sits cradled in the foothills of the Italian Alps, 30 miles south of the Swiss border. An 18th-century bridge over the Dora Baltea river leads to a quaint historic downtown of cobbled streets and pastel-colored buildings. But in the 1970s, Ivrea was Italy’s answer to Silicon Valley. It was the hometown of Olivetti, an icon of postwar European design, electronics, and manufacturing. The company’s most famous devices—its portable typewriters—were the Apple products of their day, technological fetish objects that were coveted around the world. In the early days of the computer industry, Olivetti was one of the few European contenders for market dominance; in 1965, it released the world’s first device marketed commercially as a “desktop computer.” The young Gianroberto Casaleggio was one of Olivetti’s software designers. A local with a long mane of frizzy hair, he had studied physics in college before dropping out and turning to computers. He ended up in a small office on a quiet lane developing Olivetti’s operating systems. Enrica Zublena, an engineer who worked next to Casaleggio for many years, remembers their early days at the company as an exciting time. “We thought we could become a reference point for the evolution of basic IT around the world,” Zublena says. Olivetti was a heady place to work in other ways as well, especially for anyone prone to utopian thinking. Adriano Olivetti, the late owner and general manager of the firm, had run his company as a kind of philosopher-CEO. He built futuristic factories and living complexes for his workers in Ivrea and advocated a “third way” between right and left sociopolitical thinking; he started his own political movement—a fusion of liberalism, socialism, and local self-determinism—which took him all the way to Parliament. He also wrote books expounding on his views. In one, Democracy Without Political Parties, he argued that technology should be used to hand the mechanics of politics back to citizens. Casaleggio shared Olivetti’s interest in the transformative potential of computing. “We saw the birth of the client-server model in IT,” Zublena says—the emergence of systems that distribute tasks among many computers in a network, allowing distant nodes to cooperate. “It brought a level of decisionmaking freedom to the periphery.” It seemed inevitable to Casaleggio that such architectures would change everything in society. By the 1990s, Casaleggio was running his own company, and it was his turn to play philosopher-CEO. The firm, which was eventually called Webegg, quickly became one of the leading internet consulting outfits in Italy, doing a brisk business helping older firms to find “web-based solutions” and otherwise navigate the bewildering world of bits, messaging software, and online marketing. “It was the time of the first call centers, the first internet banking,” says Zublena, who followed her colleague to Webegg. But Casaleggio was impatient to explore the grander implications of the internet. In a monthly column for a magazine called Web Marketing Tools, he inveighed against the drabness of most thinking about the web. “The net has been reduced to an instrument of financial speculation and marketing,” he wrote, but its true significance was as a force for “radical social and revolutionary change.” Perhaps most of all, Casaleggio was interested in how the internet would transform organizations from the inside. Accordingly, he turned Webegg into a laboratory for sometimes bizarre social experimentation. Throughout his career, Casaleggio liked to give extraordinary responsibilities to his youngest, most talented, and most impressionable recruits. One such hire at Webegg was a Bolognese engineer named Carlo Baffè. When he arrived fresh out of school in 1997, Baffè was promptly handed the reins to one of the company’s biggest projects. “Don’t worry,” Casaleggio reassured him. “Napoleon invaded Italy when he was 26.” About a year later, Baffè got another call. “I have this new special project in mind,” Casaleggio told him. “Would you like to join?” Baffè accepted eagerly. He went to the company’s Milan headquarters and, in a meeting room near Casaleggio’s office, sat at a circular table with the CEO and four other young, excited employees, all from different parts of the firm. Casaleggio explained that the aim of this new project was to experiment with communication dynamics on the company’s intranet. Casaleggio would select topics from the firm’s internal forum and assign members of the group specific roles to play in each discussion. Say he wanted a forum debate to reach conclusion X: One member of the restricted group would suggest X, a second would argue for contradictory conclusion Y, and over time a third would post a variation on X—and so on, subtly driving the rest of the unwitting employees toward the preordained conclusion. Baffè and the other experimenters worked a few hours a week on the project and met with Casaleggio once a month to evaluate progress. The original stated aim of the project was to observe how internal electronic communications worked, and then to sell the findings as a consulting service. But the experiment also had more far-reaching implications, Baffè realized. Casaleggio was interested in learning how consensus—on, say, whether people should be happy to work long hours—could be manufactured in a way that looked organic. Twenty years before trolls working for Russia’s Internet Research Agency would use similar techniques to steer debate on Facebook and other online forums, Casaleggio seemed to be using his own company as a laboratory to figure out how online discourse could be guided from above. “I’d just started working and was excited to be part of a project like that,” Baffè says. It wasn’t until years later, he says, that he “realized it was the beginning of a long-term experiment.” The intranet study group was only one such special project. Baffè was also invited to join another select group of about 20 employees who were given advanced communications training, grounded in something called neuro-linguistic programming. A new-age therapeutic phenomenon, NLP purportedly offers a means to influence people by surreptitiously tapping into the unconscious patterns that guide their behavior. Practitioners are taught that people can be “reprogrammed” —to shed a phobia, say, or desire a product—with relative ease. “It taught us how to classify people,” Baffè says: By identifying which kinds of metaphors a client favored, employees at Webegg could aim to “mirror” that client, making them more susceptible to the company’s message. The sessions also focused on the teachings of an American hypnotherapist named Milton H. Erickson, who likewise made extraordinary claims about the suggestibility of the unconscious mind. By subtly confusing and unsettling his patients, Erickson claimed that he could induce them into trance states that made them more pliable. (NLP is popular among sales gurus and with the modern pickup artist community, but psychologists tend to regard it as a pseudoscience.) The monthly sessions were led by two psychologists, a man and a woman, and they were a bit like “group therapy,” Baffè says. Employees were encouraged to air their feelings. At first, Baffè was thrilled to take part. But gradually his enthusiasm waned as he began to wonder who, exactly, was being influenced. The psychologists were seemingly omnipresent in the Webegg offices, where they appeared to be keeping tabs on staff for Casaleggio. “I’m sure he controlled every single detail of their activity,” Baffè says. (WIRED spoke to one of the psychologists, who confirmed that she had worked with Webegg and called Casaleggio a “true visionary” but declined to be interviewed.) In practice, Casaleggio’s intranet discussions, group sessions, and psychological interventions often seemed to be a means of bypassing directors and team leaders—the firm’s middlemen—to exert maximal influence over his staff. “The channel is direct between the boss and every employee,” Baffè says. Increasingly, the young engineer started to see Casaleggio as an “evil scientist.” This impression was reinforced by his boss’s increasingly eccentric behavior. During the Y2K panic, Casaleggio printed out a “decalogue”—a set of 10 commandments—telling employees what to do if civilization collapsed. He wrote a magazine column praising Genghis Khan’s (apocryphal) practice of murdering his generals at random as an effective means of keeping subordinates and intermediaries on their toes. Khan, he wrote, “became the greatest conqueror in history with the application of techniques and principles that are necessary today to compete on the web.” “The interactive leader will then be the new politician,” Casaleggio wrote, “someone who continually transforms the wishes of public opinion into reality.” But even as he praised Khan’s absolute rule, Casaleggio also extolled the absolute power that masses of people would have over their leaders in the internet era. In a 2001 book entitled The Web Is Dead, Long Live the Web, Casaleggio described how technology would force governments to become completely transparent and accountable to the will of the people. “Referenda on topics of national importance will become as routine as reading the papers or the evening news,” he wrote. “The interactive leader will then be the new politician, someone who continually transforms the wishes of public opinion into reality. This new politician will not need interpretation by today’s media, which will thus lose their importance.” Like any number of cyber-utopians writing in places like WIRED—several of whose writers he cited in his work—Casaleggio repeatedly predicted the imminent demise of journalism. He held that in a few years, information would become a utility, like electricity or water, pervading people’s daily lives; it would replace the current “virtual reality” that the press had constructed for them, “the Matrix that surrounds us.” To his point, the media Matrix in Italy was exceptionally claustrophobic: In 2001, the scandal-prone media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi had just begun his second term as prime minister; not only did he own the biggest commercial television network, he also dominated the state broadcaster, RAI. While Casaleggio was busy peering into the future, he was neglecting more run-of-the-mill sources of revenue that Webegg needed to turn a profit. “He put all the best people on the new stuff that was very sexy for him,” Baffè says. But the company’s core business foundered. “At some point,” Baffè says, “his ego took over.” Amid mounting financial losses, Casaleggio was forced out in 2003 by the company’s main shareholder, Telecom Italia. Webegg closed shortly thereafter. Casaleggio had the contacts and experience to remain a player in the Italian tech industry, but by then his interest in the early internet was pivoting from business to another arena: politics. Even those who knew Casaleggio well (but who perhaps didn’t read his books closely) were surprised by the sudden turn. Zublena remembers telling him, “But Gianroberto, you’ve never been remotely interested in politics!” In response, the usually taciturn Casaleggio burst out laughing, exposing the boyish gap between his front two teeth. “Come on,” she persisted, “with all the things in the world, you’re going into politics?” But Casaleggio only laughed and kept his reasons to himself. Edoardo Narduzzi, who had known Casaleggio since 1998 and served as a Webegg board member, thinks Casaleggio saw “an interesting space” in Italian politics, ripe for testing out his ideas for a web-based, bottom-up movement—“a political startup.” It all began with a simple punt. In 2004, Casaleggio ran as an independent candidate in his home village, near Ivrea. Out of 294 votes cast for a seat on a local council, Casaleggio won just six. That didn’t mean he would give up. All he needed was a front man. As Italy’s top barnstorming comedian, Beppe Grillo was accustomed to overzealous fans. But none made an impression like the visitor who came to see him one night in April 2004. After a show in the coastal city of Livorno, Gianroberto Casaleggio appeared at Grillo’s dressing room door and introduced himself as a web entrepreneur. But with his shock of wild gray hair, John Lennon glasses, and quiet intensity, Grillo recalls, he seemed more like an “evil genius.” Grillo recounts this first meeting in a preface he wrote for Casaleggio’s next book, Web Ergo Sum. “He explained webcasting to me, direct democracy, chatterbots, wiki, downshifting, usability, objects of digital interaction, social networks, Reed’s law, intranets, and copyleft,” Grillo recalled. He likened Casaleggio to the medieval radical Saint Francis of Assisi, but “instead of talking to wolves and to the birds, he spoke to the internet.” The comedian was initially wary: “Everything was clear,” Grillo wrote, “he was a madman.” But Casaleggio’s madness was one that envisioned a better future thanks to the web: companies made democratic, the end of political intermediation, and the devolution of power down to the individual. Before long, Grillo fell under Casaleggio’s spell—which was remarkable, given that Grillo had famously long been a technophobe. For a time, he had been known for smashing computers with a sledgehammer during his act. Casaleggio offered to build Grillo a blog. The comedian was a household name in Italy, but he’d been sacked from state television in the 1980s after making an off-color joke about corruption in the then-Socialist government. Now Casaleggio was offering him a new route to a mass audience and a way out of endless theater tours: the internet. “We’re going to become one of the three top blogs in the world,” Casaleggio promised. And so began a partnership that would transform Italian politics. On January 26, 2005, nine months after Casaleggio’s visit to Grillo’s dressing room in Livorno, the blog, beppegrillo.it, went live. It was, at the start, a simple black and white affair, firing out a post or two a day. The few tabs listed tour dates, information on Grillo’s latest show—fairly typical elements of a fan page. But another tab, labeled “How to Use the Blog,” gestured at something more grand and open-ended. “Beppe Grillo’s blog is an open space at your disposal,” the page explained. “Its usefulness depends on your collaboration; for this reason, you are the real and only person responsible for the content and its fate.” Grillo’s first posts were short and snappy. “Is there any sense in still speaking of right, or left, or center?” ranted one. “We don’t need a leader, we are adults!” Within months, the number of commenters on any given post had mushroomed into the hundreds, and soon thousands. Posts became ever more detailed and elaborate, with embedded video, images, and cartoons. Video and phone interviews with intellectuals brought in the likes of economist Joseph Stiglitz, Italian playwright Dario Fo, and Noam Chomsky. The blog hosted articles and letters by other writers; it started to seem more like a cultural institution than a comedian’s promo page. Today, when the most prominent members of Five Star think back to what got them hooked on beppegrillo.it, most of them describe how it provided a compelling source of alternative information: a rival to the traditional, Berlusconi-dominated media. Alessandro Di Battista was a young university graduate in music and performing arts when he started frequenting the site. “I read in Beppe’s blog what I’d always wanted to read in the newspapers, but that you could never find,” Di Battista says. Grillo’s blog dealt in “counterinformation,” as Di Battista calls it, “taking political positions that seemed to me fundamental but that no one else had the courage to take.” A blog post announced a new Meetup group called Friends of Beppe Grillo, through which readers could “transform a virtual debate into a moment of change.” Beginning that first year, Grillo and Casaleggio also used the blog to push their readers toward political action. They launched initiatives like Parlamento Pulito, or “Clean Parliament,” an email-writing campaign to protest the number of elected officials in Italy with criminal convictions. And in July 2005, six months after the website’s launch, a blog post announced a new group on Meetup called Friends of Beppe Grillo, through which readers could arrange to meet, discuss, and “transform a virtual debate into a moment of change.” Several such groups instantly popped up around the country, including one in Naples started by a recent communications graduate named Roberto Fico. “Within two months, there were almost 300 members,” Fico says. The young Fico poured all of his spare time into the burgeoning Friends of Grillo movement as he cycled through jobs in PR, tourism, and at a call center. “As soon as I finished work, I’d go to the meetings, the demonstrations,” he says. Thanks in part to his group’s activism, in 2006 a local Democratic Party water privatization scheme was successfully blocked. “The point,” Fico says, “was that it was political, but outside the institutions.” In addition to commenting on posts and joining Meetup groups, beppegrillo.it also urged its readers to start their own blogs. One such fan turned blogger was a young college dropout named Marco Canestrari. In September 2006, the unemployed Canestrari happened to meet Casaleggio at an event; he had no idea who the older man was. But Casaleggio told him, “I know you who you are; I follow your blog.” Shortly thereafter, Casaleggio offered Canestrari a job at his new internet consulting firm, Casaleggio Associates. Canestrari, 23, could hardly believe his luck: “That was my first job, actually.” Based in an exclusive neighborhood in Milan, Casaleggio Associates employed about 10 people at the time—most of them former employees of Webegg. The young Canestrari found his new boss “very clever, interesting, and exciting,” an avid reader of history, comics, and science fiction, particularly the novels of Isaac Asimov. Despite their age gap, Canestrari and Casaleggio, then in his fifties, formed a close rapport, with Casaleggio often expounding on his views about the web and the future. “He basically talked about that all day, all the time,” says Canestrari, one of the few people Casaleggio took into confidence. Within a short time, Casaleggio—in keeping with his habit of delegating large tasks to unformed young men—made Canestrari a manager of beppegrillo.it. After just three years, Grillo’s page was already the most popular site on the Italian internet and one of the 10 most-read blogs in the world. But the fact that most astounded Canestrari as he took up his new position was this: “Grillo never wrote a single word on the blog,” he says. Grillo and Casaleggio would speak several times a day to discuss the contents of the daily posts, and Casaleggio might read out the final draft to Grillo over the phone, says Filippo Pittarello, another employee who helped to produce the site. But according to multiple sources, it was Casaleggio, not Grillo, who actually wrote the hottest blog in Italy. Just like the page’s millions of readers, Canestrari had no inkling of this before coming to work for Casaleggio. Far from feeling hoodwinked, he was thrilled to see behind the curtain. At Casaleggio’s side, he would get to play a vital role in a political revolution. In 2007, the staff at Casaleggio Associates celebrated the millionth comment on beppegrillo.it. Casaleggio spent whole days reading the comments, according to Canestrari and Pittarello, and he recognized a lot of the commenters, especially the more active ones. He thought that, through the blog, he was seeing into the belly of Italy—what its people really thought and felt. And what he noticed was anger. Casaleggio had recently watched V for Vendetta, a 2005 dystopian futuristic thriller. (Tagline: “People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.”) In the film, Britain is ruled by a fascist dictatorship; one night, a lone insurgent wearing a Guy Fawkes mask hacks into a state-controlled news broadcast and tells the people of Britain to meet him outside Parliament in exactly one year, setting in motion the end of the regime. Inspired by the movie, Casaleggio wrote a late-night post, published under Grillo’s name, on June 14, 2007. Beneath a picture of a Guy Fawkes mask, Casaleggio summoned all of Grillo’s readers to gather in person for something called Vaffanculo Day, or “Fuck Off Day,” in three months’ time—a mass collective middle finger to the political establishment. The morning after writing the post, on his way to the office, Casaleggio reportedly called and told his son, Davide—who was also a young employee at Casaleggio Associates—to gather the rest of the staff for a breakfast meeting downstairs. “We have to do something big,” Casaleggio told the group, according to a book that Canestrari later cowrote about the origins of Five Star, called Supernova. “The anger is rising, and if we don’t let it vent in some way, it’ll die out.” The ostensible purpose of V Day would be to ratchet up the Parlamento Pulito campaign. The goal: to collect signatures to force a law that would limit elected representatives to two terms and ban candidates with criminal convictions. But the deeper purpose was to muster a show of force—to demonstrate that the movement wasn’t just a virtual phenomenon. Canestrari worked day and night over the next three months, coordinating with Friends of Grillo Meetup groups to mobilize them. Casaleggio called every contact he had. The Italian web fizzed with anticipation; the national press was silent. The day before V Day, Canestrari and Pittarello drove down from Milan to Bologna, where a giant stage was being set up in the city’s main plaza. By the afternoon of V Day, September 8, 2007, the square had swollen with a crowd of about 50,000 people. All around Italy, in some 200 squares, other crowds were massing too. In Naples, people started lining up at 9 am to sign petitions, says Fico, who ran the signature-collecting campaign in his home city. “We couldn’t believe our eyes.” When Grillo got to the microphone in Bologna at around 4:30 pm, he took in the crowd, visibly shaken. It was enormous. “Boh … what have we done?” he finally said, teetering around the stage and shaking his head in disbelief. Gathering himself, he launched into a typically throat-tearing tirade against Italy’s ruling elite. The success of V Day was thrilling. Two million people had turned out across the country; 350,000 signatures were gathered for the Parlamento Pulito. And it had all been meticulously planned by Casaleggio Associates. “The entire company was there that day,” Canestrari says. Yes, the grassroots Meetup groups had been in charge of collecting signatures, “but everything else—everything else—was organized by us.” And if anyone asked who Canestrari and his colleagues were? “We called ourselves the ‘Beppe Grillo staff,’ so nobody knew.” The vast majority of people in the movement had no idea that Casaleggio or his consulting firm even existed. “Grillo has always been the front man, and he knew that,” Canestrari says. “And it was fun for him. But he never made a real decision about anything.” Hoping to channel the energy of V Day, Friends of Grillo groups around the country started to talk about putting some of their members forward as independent candidates in local elections. Paola Nugnes ran for a seat in the regional senate of Campania. Roberto Fico ran for the presidency of the same region. Alessandro Di Battista ran in municipal elections in his native Rome. The idea was that, even with just a few elected officials at the lowest levels, the movement’s “counterinformation” would inexorably seep into town and regional governments. With this turn toward electoral politics, Casaleggio told Canestrari to start developing an online platform to unify the disparate Meetup groups: a single web portal with a forum. Casaleggio also wanted to give some shape to the movement’s politics. “Let’s set some rules,” he said. Friends of Grillo members elected to office would have to observe a two-term limit. No candidates with criminal convictions were allowed, nor were those who had ever sought election under another party. Just a few fixed principles, Casaleggio said, like Asimov’s three laws of robotics. The rules offered insurance that the movement’s politicians would be amateurs, not careerists. They also ensured that Grillo could never run for office in his own movement: He had been convicted of manslaughter in 1981 after a tragic car accident. The Friends of Grillo barely made a showing in those early local elections; many candidates, including Fico and Di Battista, failed to get more than 1 or 2 percent of the vote. But their careers in politics were far from over. On October 4, 2009—as the global economic crisis began to pummel Italy, setting off a decade of malaise and widespread youth unemployment—the Five Star Movement was officially launched in a packed theater in Milan. From the stage, Grillo said they were starting the party because no one was listening to them, but he admitted that he wasn’t sure what they were doing or where they were going. Casaleggio, however, knew exactly where they were headed: Rome. A Five Star demonstration in Rome in 2013, shortly after the movement sent 163 of its members to serve in Italy’s Parliament. Five Star’s attempts at competing in local and regional politics in the next few years were fairly undistinguished. The party did well in Sicily’s regional vote in October 2012, after Grillo, 64, swam to the island from mainland Italy in a media stunt. (A life-jacketed Casaleggio followed by boat.) But ahead of 2013’s general election, the movement’s huge slate of candidates was barely polling in the double digits. No one was prepared, in other words, when Five Star stormed into Italy’s Parliament with 25 percent of the vote in February 2013. Casaleggio suddenly found himself an object of morbid public fascination. The Italian press was relentless in its scrutiny—and its derision—of the bizarre-looking web entrepreneur turning Italian politics on its head. The papers often described Casaleggio as Grillo’s “guru.” The business daily Il Sole 24 Ore wrote that Casaleggio ran Five Star “like the cult of Genghis Khan.” Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by the Berlusconi family, mocked a 2008 video that Casaleggio had made as the ravings of a crank. (The short animated film, which refers darkly to the Masons and the Bilderberg Group, envisions an apocalyptic world war that will usher in a single, global direct democracy, administered by Google.) “I will never forget how they treated him,” says Alessandro Di Battista, who’d just been elected to the lower house. At the same time, 163 brand-new, almost wholly inexperienced Five Star MPs also came under the media’s klieg lights. Unsurprisingly for a movement with no ideological consistency or message discipline, the MPs offered plenty of fodder. The new leader of the lower house, Five Star’s Roberta Lombardi, made front-page news when it came out that she had once written a blog post that seemed to defend fascism and its original “socialist-inspired sense of national community.” And a live feed in which the new MPs earnestly introduced themselves to the public was met with widespread mockery. “Hi, I’m Simona,” went one parody. “I have a degree and I’m unemployed. I bend over backwards to manage my monthly budget and I want to be economy minister.” Casaleggio came to Rome to try to reassure the new MPs, many of whom had never met their party’s cofounder. “If we stay united,” he told them, “there’s no obstacle we can’t overcome.” Suffice it to say, they didn’t stay united. Several paradoxes were quickly emerging at the heart of the Five Star project. On the one hand, Casaleggio was busy developing the technology that would evenly distribute power across the breadth of the movement. By mid 2013, users of beppegrillo.it, still Five Star’s central website, could click through to a web portal where they could sign up as Five Star members, log in, and access a basic direct democracy platform—for the moment, a glorified web forum that let members review laws proposed by Five Star MPs, debate their content, and suggest wiki-style edits. Even still, users felt the thrill of direct participation in policymaking. But at the same time, Casaleggio was anxious to mold and prop up a few key leaders. Shortly after the elections, he invited a select group of the most telegenic young MPs to Milan for media and communications training. Di Battista, who had won a seat in the lower house, was one of them. So was Fico. They were joined by a young college dropout named Luigi Di Maio and a few others. The meetings were led by a TV coach who was skilled in, among other things, neuro-linguistic programming. Casaleggio began using the blog and, increasingly, social media to elevate this handpicked group to become the biggest political stars in Italy. They had little in common with each other, save that they had almost all been near-penniless young men before Casaleggio picked them up and mentored them. “Gianroberto was a second father to me,” Di Battista says. “He was the man who gave me the biggest opportunity of my life ... I have never known a person who knew how to listen like him.” Casaleggio maintained an arm’s-length relationship with the rest of Five Star’s parliamentary caucus. He hired a former journalist named Nicola Biondo to help run the movement’s press office in Rome and to run herd on the other new members of Parliament. Biondo regretted taking on the role after just a few weeks on the job. The Five Star MPs were difficult to manage. They often ignored his advice; they tried to make TV appearances that hadn’t been sanctioned by Casaleggio or Grillo. Time and again, Biondo would get a call from Casaleggio saying: “Why are they saying that?” Casaleggio was building an army of “digital soldiers” that could be steered against political adversaries, establishment figures, and internal dissenters alike. Things got worse when Casaleggio fell ill and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. “Some MPs tried to profit by his absence,” Biondo says. The web entrepreneur was desperate to stay in control of his wildly successful project, but he felt his grip weakening. Biondo recalls sitting in Casaleggio’s office one day; the older man placed a hand on Biondo’s leg and confided in him. “I’ve realized that in my political activity there are many people who wish me ill, who attack me with negative energy,” Casaleggio said. “I sense that so many people hate me.” Casaleggio seemed increasingly obsessed with the idea that people were out to get him. “He was constantly searching for people who would adore him, who would never question his intelligence,” says Biondo, who would go on to coauthor the book Supernova with Canestrari. Meanwhile, dissenters began to be expelled from the movement—one for going on TV without permission, another for criticizing the running of the party as a “feudal system of loyalty.” One MP was kicked out for calling Five Star a “cult of fanatics” in which criticism was not permitted. The movement was streamlining. MPs were reportedly told to hand over the usernames and passwords to their email accounts; some gave Casaleggio Associates access to their social media accounts as well. Rising stars like Di Battista and Di Maio were constantly posting on Facebook to their hundreds of thousands of followers, and Casaleggio appointed employees at his firm to study Google Analytics and Facebook Insights to monitor which social media posts went viral, so their success could be replicated. According to Biondo, Casaleggio was also building his online movement into an army of “digital soldiers” that could be steered against political adversaries, establishment figures, and internal dissenters alike. “He did the same on the blog as he did at Webegg,” Biondo says. “This is called social engineering.” Although Grillo’s blog had supposedly been founded to combat the virtual reality—the “Matrix”—of traditional media, Casaleggio’s employees at times peddled dubious information themselves. Some posts on the blog attacked obligatory vaccination in Italy, regurgitating unfounded claims that vaccines were linked to autism. The site also began to lead its readers toward political conclusions that strayed somewhat from Five Star’s origins. Despite the movement’s vaguely progressive cast of mind, Casaleggio himself had long harbored certain right-wing sympathies. He thought the rights of citizens should not become subservient to international bodies like the European Union, and he respected that populist parties like Lega often called for referenda in the name of self-determination. (As it happens, Casaleggio and the founders of Lega both share a common inspiration: the political philosophy of Adriano Olivetti.) And as Five Star attained real political power, Casaleggio set about steering it to the right. In 2014, Italian voters sent 17 members of Five Star to serve in the European Parliament, the body that oversees the European Union. According to one of the movement’s young delegates to Brussels, Marco Zanni, Casaleggio quickly made it clear that he wanted Five Star to ally with the UK Independence Party—the party led by far-right British provocateur Nigel Farage, whose lifelong mission was to get Britain to leave the European Union—in the EU Parliament. Five Star’s web portal now included a tool for subjecting important decisions to an online vote, and so the decision on whether to ally with UKIP was put to the movement: direct democracy in action. But in the days and weeks before the vote, Casaleggio published articles on the blog hailing Farage as a democratic crusader against a monolithic EU. “Farage Defends the Sovereignty of the Italian People,” read one headline. Another article, entitled “Nigel Farage, The Truth,” listed UKIP’s supposedly progressive credentials, such as being an “antiwar … democratic organization” where “no form of racism, sexism, or xenophobia is tolerated,” and which believes in “direct democracy.” The post that finally teed up the online vote made it very clear that the proposed alliance with UKIP was the best and only solution. According to Zanni, this was Casaleggio Associates’ modus operandi when it came to online votes: Provide a “cosmetic” appearance of choice while pushing for a particular option. In the end, 78 percent of the members who voted opted to join Farage. After years of studying how to shape online consensus, Casaleggio had mastered the art. The alliance with UKIP was just the beginning. On a crisp morning in January 2015, Casaleggio Associates received some unusual visitors: Farage, Raheem Kassam—then a UKIP strategist, later a Breitbart London editor and aide to Steve Bannon on his European missions—and Liz Bilney, the future CEO of pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU. The group wanted to learn how Five Star had pulled off its stunning political rise, and to grasp how it used technology—“to understand the mechanics of it all,” Bilney says. Casaleggio and his son, Davide, gave them a briefing that offered a timeline of important events in web-based politics and the development of Five Star. Then father and son explained the new and improved direct democracy platform they were developing for the movement. Soon, they said, registered members would be able to propose laws and debate and edit them, as well as use the portal to put themselves forward and select candidates in online ballots. As an engine for user engagement—a crucial metric in social media as in politics—the platform seemed formidable. Farage “thought it was fascinating,” Bilney says, “because UKIP were keen to build their membership.” Kassam agrees that Farage was “very excited” by the meeting. “He wanted me to go and look into the systems that they used,” Kassam says, “and how UKIP might implement them.” The Casaleggios didn’t share much technical know-how with the group, but Kassam was impressed by how many resources they were dedicating to Five Star’s digital operations and data analysis. Bilney, for her part, left the meeting buzzing with ideas about the way Five Star used social media. It was this meeting, she says, that “planted the seed of ideas” that would lead to the success of Brexit. Leave.EU was founded six months after the Milan meeting, and a year after that the UK voted to leave the EU. (Bilney is now under criminal investigation for allegedly breaking spending rules.) A few months after the meeting, a post on Grillo’s blog announced that the new version of Five Star’s online direct democracy platform was almost ready. It would be called Rousseau, and it would serve as the Five Star Movement’s mobile-friendly “operating system.” After users logged in, they would land on a homepage with different primary-colored windows for voting on candidates and party decisions, as well as for proposing and debating laws, participating in fund-raising, and more. Beppe Grillo had known that Rousseau—the long-awaited, all-singing, all-dancing version of the direct democracy web portal—was on its way. What he hadn’t been told was that Casaleggio Associates was also building a new website that would supplant beppegrillo.it as the online home of Five Star. Fearing he was being squeezed out, Grillo confronted Casaleggio. As recounted in the book Supernova, the phone call quickly turned sour: “Vaffanculo!” Casaleggio yelled down the line. “I never want to hear from you again.” “Vaffanculo!  ” Casaleggio yelled down the line. I never want to hear from you again.” Those were the last words Grillo would ever hear from Five Star’s cofounder. Those were the last words Grillo would ever hear from Casaleggio. Grillo initially agreed to a written interview for this article, only to later demand 1,000 euros per question, with a minimum of eight questions. I wondered if it was a weird joke—Grillo is famous for his offbeat humor—but a few days later a post appeared on his blog detailing his new tariff for conversations with the press. WIRED does not pay for interviews. Despite Grillo’s vital role in the rise of Five Star, Casaleggio arranged, from his deathbed, for the ascension of his son, Davide, to a position of great power within the movement. Legal documents signed just before Casaleggio’s death state that Rousseau was to be managed by a new organization, the Rousseau Association. The documents also set up Davide Casaleggio, the new CEO of Casaleggio Associates, to be the Rousseau Association’s president and treasurer. He is, in short, the absolute ruler of Five Star’s data. (Casaleggio declined to speak with WIRED.) Five Star’s MPs are forced by new rules to pay 300 euros a month toward the running of the platform. Grillo, for his part, retained the rights to Five Star’s name and logo. On April 12, 2016, Gianroberto Casaleggio died in Milan at the age of 61. As his coffin was carried out of the church that houses Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, a throng of Five Star supporters chanted “Onesta!” (“Honesty!”)—a party slogan. Di Maio and a tearful Di Battista led the chorus. Also in attendance was Umberto Bossi, the founder of Lega. Outside the funeral, a banner read: “We will realize your dream.” The day after Casaleggio died, Rousseau went live. As the 2018 national elections approached, Five Star took one more step away from its original conception as a horizontal, leaderless movement: Via an online ballot on Rousseau, it set about choosing an official party chief. Once again, the contest offered a somewhat cosmetic appearance of choice. Of the best-known, highly groomed members of Five Star, only Luigi Di Maio ran for the job. Fico and Di Battista kept their heads down. So Di Maio was pitted against a slate of relative unknowns, including Elena Fattori. To no one’s surprise, Di Maio won, becoming Five Star’s leader at 31 years old in the fall of 2017. Only about 30 percent of Rousseau’s members voted. Afterward, Grillo began to distance himself from the movement. In January 2018, when Grillo relaunched his blog, there wasn’t a Five Star logo in sight. Steve Bannon—the former White House chief strategist and far-right impresario—has been trying to unify Europe’s most strident populists into a supergroup called the Movement. Some nationalists have been receptive; others see him as an unwelcome foreign influence. (Go figure.) Five Star has held off on joining. Here’s how Bannon has fared elsewhere. —Graham Hacia BELGIUM - Mischaël Modrikamen: Cofounder of the Belgian People’s Party. Helped establish the Movement. ITALY - Matteo Salvini: Interior minister and leader of the anti-immigrant party Lega. Said his party would join. UK - Jacob Rees-Mogg: Pro-Brexit conservative parliamentarian. Said he has no interest. FRANCE - Marine Le Pen: Leader of France’s far-right National Rally. Met with Bannon but distanced herself. GERMANY - Alice Weidel: Cofounder of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Called the project “exciting” but then backed away. HUNGARY - Viktor Orbán: Prime minister and leader of the nationalist Fidesz party. Praised the idea but hasn’t committed. SPAIN - Santiago Abascal: Leader of Spain’s ultraconservative VOX party. Said to count his party in. CZECH REPUBLIC - Milos Zeman: President of the Republic. Said “I absolutely disagree with his views.” NETHERLANDS - Geert Wilders: Parliamentary leader of the anti-Islam Party for Freedom. Likes Bannon but hasn’t joined. On March 4, 2018, Five Star participated in its second national election. This time, Nugnes, the architect turned parliamentarian, watched the coverage on TV alongside activists and representatives in a hotel in central Naples. Unlike in 2013, everyone knew Five Star would do well. But the final results were nevertheless stunning—with 33 percent of the vote, and after just five years in parliament, Five Star had become the largest party in Italy. While her colleagues celebrated, Nugnes worried. “I just saw right away that the overall picture was very disquieting,” she says. Right-wing parties—particularly Lega—had performed well too, off the back of a fiercely anti-immigrant campaign. Nugnes watched uneasily as Five Star tried to form a government, seeming to go against the movement’s original “no alliances” principle. From the start, it was clear that Di Maio—who had criticized the previous, centrist government for presiding over a corrupt, NGO-run “sea taxi” service for migrants to Italy—favored a deal with Lega. Nugnes, who had made a name during the previous five years as an outspoken senator, wrote a scathing post on Facebook about the prospect of an alliance with “he who wants to end immigration,” referring to Lega’s leader, Salvini. “I wouldn’t get into the same elevator,” she went on, “or breathe the same air.” After nearly 90 days of talks, Five Star and Lega came to an agreement; Di Maio and Salvini would share power as deputy prime ministers. When the agreement went up for a vote before Five Star’s members via Rousseau, an astounding 94 percent approved the deal. Movement heavyweights insist that the agreement isn’t an alliance. “If it were an alliance, it would be completely different,” Fico says, explaining that the two parties had instead arrived at a “contract” on a specific program of legislation—a contract that included, crucially, Five Star’s cherished plan for a universal basic income. The new Italian government was hailed by populists around the world. “What is happening here is extraordinary. There has never been a truly populist government in modern times,” Bannon told La Repubblica. “I want to be a part of it.” Bannon gloated that he had advised Salvini to make the deal with Five Star, and he claimed that he had advised Five Star as well. A source close to Bannon confirmed to WIRED that when he was in Rome in June, Bannon met with Davide Casaleggio. Days after the new government took power, Salvini—assuming a dual role as both interior minister and deputy PM—closed Italy’s ports to migrant rescue boats and proposed a census of the country’s Roma community ahead of possible expulsions. Some four months later, Five Star’s universal basic income was approved by Parliament in the government’s annual budget. Di Maio promptly took to the balcony of the parliamentary palace to punch the air in celebration. “We’re going to end up with machines replacing many of today’s jobs,” he tells me later, echoing a common argument in Silicon Valley. “The basic income can be a tool not just to help struggling families but one that allows us to face the fourth industrial revolution.” “If they expel me, it will mean that this is no longer the right place for me,” says Paola Nugnes, a left-wing Five Star senator. “There are so many like me in the movement.” The EU has denounced Italy’s universal basic income as profligate. The country’s public debt stands at 2.3 trillion euros, or 130 percent of the country’s GDP, which far exceeds EU limits; authorities in Brussels fear that Italy’s spendthrift budget will cause the country to default on its loans. Salvini quickly seized on Europe’s rejection of the policy to drum up anti-EU support. As his rants against immigration and the EU continue, Lega is soaring past Five Star in opinion polls. Di Maio has done little to push back against the government’s rightward turn, even as the rebels in his party are growing more defiant. Nugnes and Fattori have both courted expulsion from Five Star over the past year, after refusing to vote with the party at times. They have been subjects of internal investigation, severe criticism by Di Maio, and storms of online abuse. “If they expel me, it will mean that this is no longer the right place for me,” Nugnes says. But she adds: “There are so many like me in the movement. No one can know the future of the movement.” Many believe that the future of the movement is Alessandro Di Battista. The popular former MP decided not to run for election in 2018, despite being omnipresent during the campaign; he says he wanted to get back to the “real world” outside Parliament for a while. Insiders speculate that the real aim of his political hiatus is to avoid hitting his mandatory two-term limit. Once his ally Di Maio’s time is up, many figure, Di Battista will take over the party’s leadership. Of all the movement’s leaders, Di Battista is Five Star’s unabashed Casaleggian radical. On a scratchy WhatsApp line from Guatemala, where he has passed much of his time out of power, Di Battista comes out swinging when I ask about Five Star’s apparent rightward slide: “Today, whoever wants to take back sovereignty is considered a fascist, a nationalist, a populist, a demagogue,” he says. Such allegations, he says, are just another case of media elites missing the point. “The world can’t be judged from an attic in Manhattan. They don’t understand anything—just as they understood nothing of Trump and Brexit, just as they’ve understood nothing about the Five Star Movement.” For Di Battista, Five Star’s grand techno-utopian project is never far from sight. “Representative democracy is obsolete,” he tells me. It will soon be as old hat as absolute monarchy seems to us today. “The future is inevitably direct democracy,” he says. But who knows if that future will be quite as inevitable without a hidden hand to steer it. Darren Loucaides (@DarrenLoucaides) is a British writer who covers politics, populism, and identity.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-census-citizenship-question_n_5c634dd7e4b03de94296978b---split---The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would hear an expedited appeal in a case seeking to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The justices’ decision to take up the case of Department of Commerce v. New York was largely expected and marks the latest step in a closely watched legal battle over next year’s census. Critics contend that adding the citizenship question would discourage people, particularly people of color, from responding to the survey. An inaccurate census would have drastic consequences, they warn, because its results are used to allocate congressional seats and hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds. In January, a federal judge in Manhattan blocked the Trump administration from adding the question. Normally, the case would then go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit before heading to the Supreme Court. But with the Census Bureau facing a fast-approaching June deadline for finalizing census questions, the high court has agreed to hear argument in the appeal in late April. Both the plaintiffs in the suit ― 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant rights groups ― and the Trump administration argued in court filings that if the justices were going to take the case, they should do so quickly and bypass the 2nd Circuit. In a 277-page opinion last month, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman held that the way the Trump administration added the question ran afoul of a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. He found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had ignored analyses from experts on how damaging the question would be and cherry-picked evidence to support his desire to add the question. Ross publicly claimed that he began considering the question only after the Justice Department requested it and that the Justice Department wanted the question in order to obtain better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. But Furman, who was appointed to the federal bench by then-President Barack Obama, said the voting rights rationale was “pretextual,” a “sham justification” concealing the true reason for Ross’ decision. The decennial census ― which goes out to every American household ― hasn’t asked about citizenship since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. And a top Justice Department official was unable to explain in a sworn deposition how adding the citizenship question would get the department better citizenship data than it already had available. In total, seven different lawsuits have been filed challenging the addition of the citizenship question. This story has been updated to note that the Supreme Court will hear argument in the case in late April. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/supreme-court-will-decide-census-citizenship-question---split---The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the citizenship question case the second week of April. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The Supreme Court will decide by the end of June whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a quick schedule so questionnaires can be printed on time. In a one-line order Friday, the justices agreed to hear oral arguments in the case the second week of April. The Justice Department asked for the rapid review because the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June, which is also when the Supreme Court term ends. The high court’s decision ultimately could affect congressional delegations and appropriations. The census is used to determine the total population of the United States, regardless of immigration status, to fairly distribute federal funds to states and localities, and to reapportion congressional seats and districts, among other things. A federal judge in New York this month stopped Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from adding the question to the census, ruling that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court action Friday means the dispute leapfrogs over the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. The Trump administration argued in a petition that Ross followed the proper decision-making process to add the question, which has been used in previous censuses. Challengers argued that the question would deter immigrants from participating and ultimately benefit Republicans. The American Civil Liberties Union said the lower court found that a citizenship question would stop about 6.5 million people from participating. That would cause California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, New York and Illinois to face a “certainly impending” or “substantial risk of losing a seat” in Congress and numerous states to “lose funds from several federal programs.” Also watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

The president’s son intended to pay a visit to the office of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy but was headed to that of Speaker Nancy Pelosi before he reversed course. Heard on the Hill suspects that route was out of habit for Trump Jr., given that Paul Ryan inhabited that office when Republicans controlled the House.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/jargon-watch-rising-danger-stochastic-terrorism/---split---n. Acts of violence by random extremists, triggered by political demagoguery. When President Trump tweeted a video of himself body-slamming the CNN logo in 2017, most people took it as a stupid joke. For Cesar Sayoc, it may have been a call to arms: Last October the avowed Trump fan allegedly mailed a pipe bomb to CNN headquarters. No one told Sayoc to do it, but the fact that it happened was really no surprise. In 2011, after the shooting of US representative Gabby Giffords, a Daily Kos blog warned of a new threat the writer called stochastic terrorism: the use of mass media to incite attacks by random nut jobs—acts that are “statistically predictable but individually unpredictable.” The writer had in mind right-wing radio and TV agitators, but in 2016, Rolling Stone accused then-candidate Trump of using the same playbook when he joked that “Second Amendment people” might “do” something if Hillary Clinton won the election. Of course, Trump’s people later said he meant they might … “vote.” That’s how it works: Stochastic terrorism lets bullies operate in the open with full deniability, since the random element erases any provable causation. Tellingly, the word stochastic comes from the Greek stochastikos, meaning “proceeding by guesswork” and “skillful in aiming.” Both are apt here. It takes a master demagogue to weaponize unstable individuals and aim them at political enemies. This article appears in the February issue. Subscribe now.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Abigail Geiger, Kristen Bialik and John Gramlich The 116th U.S. Congress took office in January, with Democrats taking control of the House while Republicans maintain an edge in the Senate. Apart from its political makeup, the new Congress differs from prior ones in other ways, including its demographics. Here are six charts that show how Congress has changed over time, using historical data from CQ Roll Call, the Brookings Institution, the Congressional Research Service and other sources. 1The current Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nonwhites – including blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – now account for 22% of Congress, including a quarter of the House and 9% of the Senate. By comparison, when the 79th Congress took office in 1945, nonwhites represented just 1% of the House and Senate. Despite this growing racial and ethnic diversity, Congress still lags the nation as a whole: The share of nonwhites in the United States is nearly double that of the country’s legislative body (39% vs. 22%). Read More → Topics: Congress, Federal Government, Demographics By John Gramlich and Kat Devlin A growing share of people around the world see U.S. power and influence as a “major threat” to their country, and these views are linked with attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the United States as a whole, according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 22 nations since 2013. A median of 45% across the surveyed nations see U.S. power and influence as a major threat, up from 38% in the same countries during Trump’s first year as president in 2017 and 25% in 2013, during the administration of Barack Obama. The long-term increase in the share of people who see American power as a threat has occurred alongside declines in the shares of people who say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs and who have a favorable view of the United States. (For more about global views toward the U.S. president and the country he leads, see “Trump’s International Ratings Remain Low, Especially Among Key Allies.”) Despite these changes, U.S. power and influence still ranks below other perceived threats around the world. Considerably larger shares of people point to global climate change (seen as a major threat by a median of 67%), the Islamic militant group known as ISIS (cited by 62%) and cyberattacks (cited by 61%). U.S. power and influence, in fact, is not seen as the top threat in any of the countries surveyed. Read More → Topics: U.S. Global Image and Anti-Americanism, Country Image, Donald Trump By Abigail Geiger and Gretchen Livingston The landscape of relationships in America has shifted dramatically in recent decades. From cohabitation to same-sex marriage to interracial and interethnic marriage, here are eight facts about love and marriage in the United States. 1Half of Americans ages 18 and older were married in 2017, a share that has remained relatively stable in recent years but is down 8 percentage points since 1990. One factor driving this change is that Americans are staying single longer. The median age at first marriage had reached its highest point on record: 30 years for men and 28 years for women in 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As the U.S. marriage rate has declined, divorce rates have increased among older Americans. In 2015, for every 1,000 married adults ages 50 and older, 10 had divorced – up from five in 1990. Among those ages 65 and older, the divorce rate roughly tripled since 1990. Read More → Category: 5 Facts Topics: Lifestyle, Family and Relationships, Marriage and Divorce By Aaron Smith Algorithms are all around us, using massive stores of data and complex analytics to make decisions with often significant impacts on humans – from choosing the content people see on social media to judging whether a person is a good credit risk or job candidate. Pew Research Center released several reports in 2018 that explored the role and meaning of algorithms in people’s lives today. Here are some of the key themes that emerged from that research. 1Algorithmically generated content platforms play a prominent role in Americans’ information diets. Sizable shares of U.S. adults now get news on sites like Facebook or YouTube that use algorithms to curate the content they show to their users. A study by the Center found that 81% of YouTube users say they at least occasionally watch the videos suggested by the platform’s recommendation algorithm, and that these recommendations encourage users to watch progressively longer content as they click through the videos suggested by the site. 2The inner workings of even the most common algorithms can be confusing to users. Facebook is among the most popular social media platforms, but roughly half of Facebook users – including six-in-ten users ages 50 and older – say they do not understand how the site’s algorithmically generated news feed selects which posts to show them. And around three-quarters of Facebook users are not aware that the site automatically estimates their interests and preferences based on their online behaviors in order to deliver them targeted advertisements and other content. Read More → Topics: Emerging Technology Impacts, Science and Innovation, Future of the Internet By Christine Tamir Nigeria will be holding presidential and parliamentary elections against a backdrop of negative sentiment in the country about the state of the economy and political system. These attitudes were evident in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the summer of 2018. Nigeria is home to the largest population in Africa, which is almost evenly split between Muslims and Christians. Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be running against multiple candidates including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), John Gbor of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Usman Muhammed of the Labour Party (LP) and others. Tensions in the country have grown in the final weeks before elections because of Buhari’s controversial decision to suspend the country’s chief justice. These five charts capture the Nigerian public’s mood about the state of their nation and the differing attitudes of the Muslim and Christian populations. Read More → Topics: International Governments and Institutions, Sub-Saharan Africa, Political Attitudes and Values By Jonathan Evans Germany is the birthplace of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, but since the middle of the 20th century, the country has seen a dramatic shift away from Protestantism – one that has greatly outpaced a decline in the share of Germans who are Catholic. Protestants represented a majority (59%) of Germany’s population in 1950, with Catholics as a sizable minority (37%), according to research by Detlef Pollack and Olaf Müller, scholars of religion and sociology at the University of Münster in Germany. These shares are largely based on church membership rolls that include both children and adults. Over the next 60 years, the share of Protestants fell 30 percentage points, while the share of Catholics dropped 7 points. Each group now includes roughly three-in-ten Germans, based on 2010 membership data. Declines in the shares of Protestants and Catholics have been accompanied by a rising share of the religiously unaffiliated, who accounted for 30% of Germans in 2010, up from fewer than 4% in 1950. And recent research indicates that the share of Muslims in Germany also has been growing in recent years, due in large part to immigration. Read More → Topics: Western Europe, Catholics and Catholicism, Christians and Christianity, Religious Affiliation, Europe By David Masci Tuesday is the 210th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth, a day now celebrated by some as Darwin Day. Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution through natural selection. When Darwin’s work was first made public in 1859, it shocked Britain’s religious establishment. And while today it is accepted by virtually all scientists, evolutionary theory still is rejected by many Americans, often because it conflicts with their religious beliefs about divine creation. While not an official holiday, Darwin Day has been adopted by scientific and humanist groups to promote everything from scientific literacy to secularism. This year, dozens of events have been planned worldwide, many of them anchored by scientific talks or symposiums. To mark the occasion, here are six facts about the public’s views on evolution, as well as other aspects of the debate in the U.S. and elsewhere: 1Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults (81%) say humans have evolved over time, according to data from a new Pew Research Center study. This includes one-third of all Americans (33%) who say that humans evolved due to processes like natural selection with no involvement by God or a higher power, along with 48% who believe human evolution occurred through processes guided or allowed by God or a higher power. The same survey found that 18% of Americans reject evolution entirely, saying humans have always existed in their present form. (See the full report for a deeper look at the ways question wording and format can affect survey results on evolution.) Read More → Category: 5 Facts Topics: Religion and Society, Evolution, Religious Beliefs and Practices, Science and Innovation By Anna Brown A slight majority of Americans (53%) think it is generally unacceptable for a white person to use makeup to darken their skin to appear to be a different race as part of a Halloween costume, including 37% who say this is never acceptable. About one-in-three (34%) say this is always or sometimes acceptable, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. The survey was conducted almost entirely before news broke about Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and other high-profile politicians who have been accused of wearing blackface as part of costumes when they were younger. White adults are about twice as likely as black adults to say the use of blackface as part of a Halloween costume can be acceptable: 39% of whites hold this view vs. 19% of blacks. Hispanics fall in the middle, with 28% saying this is always or sometimes acceptable. Among whites, those younger than 30 are far less accepting of the use of blackface. About a quarter of younger whites (27%) say it is at least sometimes acceptable for a white person to use makeup to darken their skin to appear to be a different race as part of a Halloween costume, but about two-thirds say this is rarely (23%) or never (41%) acceptable. Older whites are more divided, with roughly four-in-ten of those ages 30 and older saying this is acceptable at least sometimes, and about half or fewer in each group saying this is rarely or never acceptable. Acceptance of blackface also is more common among whites without a college degree. While 44% of whites with some college or less education say this is always or sometimes acceptable, 28% of whites with at least a bachelor’s degree say the same. Read More → Topics: Race and Ethnicity By Kristen Bialik More than one-in-five voting members (22%) of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are racial or ethnic minorities, making the 116th Congress the most racially and ethnically diverse in history. There has been a long-running trend toward more racial and ethnic diversity on Capitol Hill: Each of the previous four Congresses broke the record set by the Congress before it. Overall, 116 lawmakers today are nonwhite (including blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans), according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Congressional Research Service. This represents an 84% increase over the 107th Congress of 2001-03, which had 63 minority members. Although recent Congresses have continued to set new highs for racial and ethnic diversity, they have still been disproportionately white when compared with the overall U.S. population. Nonwhites make up 39% of the nation’s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. (For this analysis, Hispanics are included in the Census Bureau estimates for the share of each racial minority group in the overall population.) In the House of Representatives, however, some racial and ethnic groups are now on par with their share of the total population. For example, 12% of House members are black, about equal to the share of Americans who are black. And Native Americans now make up 1% of the House, equal to their 1% of the population. Other nonwhite groups in the House are somewhat less represented relative to their share of the population. The share of Hispanics in the U.S. population (18%) is twice as high as it is in the House (9%). Asians account for 6% of the national population but 3% of House members. The increase in minority representation in the House has largely come among newly elected Democrats. Of the 22 freshman representatives who are nonwhite, just one is a Republican (Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who is Hispanic). Nine senators are a racial or ethnic minority, unchanged from the 115th Congress. Four senators are Hispanic, three are Asian and three are black. (Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is black and Asian). There are no nonwhite freshman senators. In the full 116th Congress, the overwhelming majority of racial and ethnic nonwhite members are Democrats (90%), while just 10% are Republicans. Non-Hispanic whites make up 78% of voting members in the new Congress, considerably larger than their 61% share of the U.S. population overall. And despite the growing racial and ethnic diversity of Congress, this gap has widened over time: In 1981, 94% of Congress was white, compared with 80% of the U.S. population. This analysis includes a few members who are counted under more than one racial or ethnic identity. In addition to Harris, Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., is counted as both black and Asian. Reps. Antonio Delgado and Adriano Espaillat, both New York Democrats, are listed as black and Hispanic. Espaillat, the first Dominican American elected to Congress, self-identifies as a Latino of African descent. Portuguese American members are not included in the Hispanic count.

Today, 63% of U.S. adults say stricter environmental regulations are “worth the cost,” while 30% say such regulations “cost too many jobs and hurt the economy,” according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. Two years ago, the balance of opinion was narrower, as 59% said stricter environmental regulations were worth the cost, while 37% said they cost too many jobs. Partisanship continues to be a major factor in opinions about tougher environmental laws, with Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to view stricter laws and regulations as worth the cost. But since 2017, the share of Republicans who take a positive view of stricter environmental laws has increased, from 36% then to 45% today. There has been little change in Democrats’ views in this period (77% then, 81% now). Still, Republicans remain less supportive of stricter environmental laws and regulations than they were during the 1990s and much of the 2000s. In 2007, for example, 58% of Republicans said they were worth the cost.

Ever wonder why people hate lawyers?

Democrats have a growing field of presidential hopefuls but their socialist ideas are lacking and overlapping examples of proven failure.

---split---5.0---split---https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/manage/---split---Select the newsletters you want to receive. It’s Valentine’s Day, Short Listers, and my mom's love life may no longer be our greatest national emergency. Today I'm loving this cuddly alligator and very much not loving the latest gross-sounding allegations about R. Kelly. Let's get to today's top news. But first: A deadly "zombie" deer disease is now in 25 states. Even worse: One expert claimed it could affect humans. President Donald Trump will sign a funding bill securing some money for a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border before declaring a national emergency to get more funding for a wall, the White House said Thursday. The measure, which offers $1.375 billion for a 55-mile border barrier – much less than the $5.7 billion that Trump demanded – was cleared by Congress Thursday evening. The spending bill now heads to Trump, who must sign it by midnight Friday to avoid another government shutdown. Declaring an emergency, however, could trigger a legal fight delaying construction at the border. But that drawn-out legal battle would give Trump a potent issue to run on ahead of 2020. Remember that second Amazon headquarters announced for New York City? Yeah, that’s not happening. In a stunning development, Amazon said Thursday it will no longer pursue their new Queens headquarters in Long Island City amid local political opposition. Amazon promised over 25,000 jobs for the city in exchange for up to $3 billion in tax breaks from state and city governments. “While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence,” the company said. The Senate on Thursday made William Barr attorney general, handing him a Justice Department with multiple investigations encircling a president who's been sharply critical of the agency's leadership. The largely party-line vote (54-45) came with concerns from some Democrats about how Barr aimed to oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation tied to the 2016 election. Barr, 68, is a widely respected Washington lawyer who already served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Attorney Michael Avenatti, who repped Stormy Daniels in her battle with Trump, has a new target: singer and accused predator R. Kelly. Avenatti claims he's unearthed "a bombshell of epic proportions" in a videotape from the 1990s of Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Avenatti shared it with CNN and the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "It's over, after nearly two decades of sexual abuse by R. Kelly," Avenatti told USA TODAY, predicting that the singer would not "survive" the discovery of the alleged tape. CNN reported Thursday that it viewed the tape and says it appears to show a man resembling Kelly having sex with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old and, at several points, calls the man "Daddy." Better late than never. After months of promises, our favorite climate agitator finally formed this week, climate scientists said Thursday. To review: El Niño is a periodic natural warming of seawater in the tropical Pacific. It's one of the biggest influences on weather and climate in the world. All this winter weather lately has had an El Niño flavor, even though it hadn't officially formed. Weak El Niño conditions should stay through the spring, weather experts say.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/2020-democratic-candidates-opposed-spending-bill---split---Gillibrand and her liberal colleagues in the Senate who are running for president opposed the spending bill. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Senate Democrats eyeing the White House split their vote Thursday on the compromise spending package that would avert another government shutdown, with nearly all the candidates who have already announced bids voting against it. The Senate overwhelmingly adopted the conference report, 83-16, but five Democrats, including four presidential contenders — Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — joined 11 Republicans in voting ‘no.’ Of the announced candidates, only Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar supported the measure. Vermont independent Bernie Sanders (who caucuses with the Democrat) and Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, neither of whom have officially jumped in the race, also voted for the package as did Colorado’s Michael Bennet and Oregon’s Jeff Merkley, who are said to be weighing 2020 runs. The more liberal Democrats in the field are positioning themselves in the Senate to win the nomination by setting up a contrast to President Donald Trump, whom the White House has said will sign the spending package Friday. Several pro-immigration groups came out against the compromise measure, saying it made too many concessions to Trump. While the bill wouldn’t give the president the $5.7 billion for the border wall that he wanted, it does include $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of barriers along the border with Mexico. The White House confirmed Thursday that Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border to redirect military funds for his desired wall, which Democrats oppose and have threatened to challenge in court. Candidates who opposed the bill spoke out against the emergency declaration, with many referring to the wall as Trump’s “vanity project.” “The President is going to abuse his power with a non-credible national emergency to go around Congress and waste taxpayer dollars for an ineffective border wall,” Gillibrand said in a statement Thursday evening. She specifically cited the spending measure’s increased funding for the Immigration and Custom Enforcement agency, saying “it comes with no accountability and will give the President the ability to continue his inhumane policies.” Booker offered a similar reasoning for his ‘no’ vote: “This funding bill gives ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] hundreds of millions of additional dollars with little oversight or appropriate guardrails.” Harris voted against the bill out of concern about the increase in funding for the Department of Homeland Security and potential increased capacity for detention facilities. Sanders said he had reservations about the legislation but ultimately supported it because of the federal workers affected by the last shutdown. “I cannot turn my back on the two million federal employees and private contract workers who would be forced, again, to work without pay,” the Vermont independent said in a statement. Across the Capitol, the House later voted comfortably, 300-128, to adopt the spending package. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who entered the Democratic presidential race last month, voted for the measure, as did California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a potential candidate.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-passes-appropriations-package-avert-shutdown-sends-trump---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conducts her weekly news conference Thursday in which she fielded questions about the government funding bill. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) The House passed a spending package Thursday night, completing congressional action to avert a government shutdown with barely a day to spare. The final vote was 300-128. Nineteen Democrats voted against the measure, while 109 Republicans, representing a majority of their conference, were opposed. Earlier in the day, the Senate passed the $333 billion fiscal 2019 package by an 83-16 vote. It contains seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills that were not signed into law before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. The four-and-a-half month delay in completing the fiscal 2019 appropriations process arose over an impasse over the Homeland Security bill — in particular President Donald Trump’s request for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. After a 35-day partial government shutdown over that issue that stretched from late December to late January, a House-Senate conference committee was formed to negotiate the final details on border security spending. The 17 appropriators on the conference committee narrowed in on a solution, before the top four appropriators from both chambers reached an agreement in principle Monday night. The final package provides just under $1.4 billion for a physical border barrier. Trump’s frustration with that figure is why he has decided to declare a national emergency to give himself the flexibility to divert other funds for construction of a barrier. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump will declare the national emergency when he signs the spending package, which is expected to be Friday given that’s the final day to prevent the government from shutting down again. The Kentucky Republican said he will support Trump’s emergency declaration, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic Caucus are opposed. The California Democrat called it “an end-run” around Congress that should alarm Republicans too. “It is interesting to see how the president has said to the Republican leadership in the Senate ... ‘I don’t have confidence in what you did,’ even though the president failed to convince the American people and their representatives in Congress of his position,” Pelosi said. Most House Republicans voted against the appropriations package because of their frustration over the lack of border wall funding, including Georgia Rep. Tom Graves, the only one of the 17 conferees who did not sign the conference report. Still, Republicans got some wins in the bill. In particular, they rejected Democrats’ demand to put a cap on the number of detention beds that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency could use for undocumented immigrants apprehended in the interior of the country, versus at the border. Some Democrats, such as Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Pramila Jayapal, voted against the legislation because of the detention issue. The legislation barely reduced the number of beds or provided restrictions that would help clamp down on the administration’s immigration enforcement policies, some progressives argued.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pence-berlin-trump_n_5c6873dce4b033a799432eb6---split---Vice President Mike Pence appeared to have overestimated his audience’s opinion of the American president on Friday when he spoke during an event at the Munich Security Conference. The vice president was in Germany as part of a delegation of U.S. lawmakers to the annual conference that dates back to the height of the Cold War. ″I especially want to invite all of you to thank Senator Lindsey Graham for leading this delegation,” Pence said. A strong round of applause followed. “And to [...] all of you I bring greetings from a great champion of freedom and of strong national defense, who must work with these members of Congress to strengthen America’s military might and strengthen the leadership of the free world,” he continued. “I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.” The crowd did not react. Pence then paused for several long seconds before continuing his planned remarks. He was speaking at the conference’s inaugural John McCain Dissertation Award ceremony, an academic prize named in honor of the late senator who attended the meeting for decades ― and who was famously antagonized by Trump. Addressing U.S. allies at the Munich Security Conference, Mike Pence is met with silence as he tells the audience: "I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump." pic.twitter.com/yr7SNVhCVf The Trump administration is not popular among the conference’s global leaders and defense chiefs. A report put out ahead of the conference decried the administration’s “irritating enthusiasm for strongmen across the globe” and “disdain for international institutions and agreements.” “The whole liberal world order appears to be falling apart ― nothing is as it once was,” Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, wrote in an editorial published ahead of the conference. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel finished an extended critique of Trump’s “America First” policies, she received an enthusiastic standing ovation. (Ivanka Trump, an adviser to the president and his eldest daughter, did not join in.) While the conference has traditionally given world leaders a moment to come together in pursuit of shared goals, this year’s tone has highlighted the division between the U.S. and other superpowers.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/border-migrants-asylum-mexico-aclu.html---split---Supported by By Jose A. Del Real, Caitlin Dickerson and Miriam Jordan TIJUANA, Mexico — Pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of Northern Mexico, thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the United States appear to have given up, Mexican officials said, dealing President Trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda. About 6,000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse, many of them in defiance of Mr. Trump’s demands that they turn around, arrived in Northern Mexico in late November as part of a caravan that originated in Honduras. Since then, more than 1,000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the Mexican government, the officials said. Another 1,000 have decided to stay in Mexico, accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall, at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans. Mr. Trump resorted on Friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from Congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the United States. But the data from Mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects. Added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers — which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify — was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in Mexico for the full duration of their legal cases, which can take years. The requirement originally applied only to adults, but the Department of Homeland Security expanded it to include families with children as well. Among those who have been dissuaded, at least for now, is Natali, 32, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety. Speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western Tijuana, she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in El Progreso, Honduras, after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang. Soon after, she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet. Once in Mexico, they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the United States, and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country. Rather than crossing the border, they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in Mexico legally for at least one year, and have slowly begun to build a life. She still believes she might ask for asylum in the United States, but is realistic about her chances. “I like Tijuana,” she said. “It’s a very pretty city and there’s a lot of work.” More than anything, she fears the United States would deport her back to Honduras. Mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the United States reinforced an idea that is often raised by Mr. Trump: that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection. “What happened is that many people came on an adventure, trying their luck,” said Cesar Palencia, Tijuana’s chief of migrant services. “When they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in Mexico were also difficult, among many factors, they decided to return home.” The Honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages, drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants. Many came from poverty, lacking education and resources, and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the United States, and who would not. Immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers. But they pointed to the roughly 4,000 members who had successfully entered the United States and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims. Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, warned that while Mr. Trump’s tough policies may discourage the undeserving, they might also endanger people who need protection. She said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers, who promise to provide passage into the United States. “It may look like it’s working in the short term,” Ms. Brané said, “But I don’t think it’s a long-term solution. It’s driving people further into the shadows and that’s exactly the opposite of what we want.” When they arrived in Mexico, many of the caravan members had been living in squalor, sleeping in tents or lean-tos inside the Benito Juárez sports complex. A downpour devastated the grounds, and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called Barretal on the outskirts of Tijuana. Once packed with 2,500 people, that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200. “It is not the same as when we had Barretal and Benito Juárez,” said Esme Flores, an immigrant-rights advocate at the San Diego office of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It really feels that the population has moved on.” On Friday, all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the Barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner, only partially covered by a tin roof. The conditions are far from comfortable, but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks. Most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the United States, but knew of others who had. Elde Rodriguez, 26, said he had left Honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter. Believing that he would not qualify for asylum, he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back. “There’s enough work here in Mexico, and you can live on that if you’re alone. But you can’t make enough to send money home, and that’s the point about all this,” he said. “If I can’t get in, I’ll just keep trying.” While Tijuana appears to be emptying, large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies. After a riot the day before, authorities in Mexico said on Friday that they would disband a group of 1,400 Central American asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of Piedras Negras to cross the border into Eagle Pass, Tex., according to news reports. The Trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, which it called Migrant Protection Protocols, is a vital response to a crisis at the border. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the United States. Introduced as a pilot program across the border from San Diego, the administration plans to expand the policy into Texas. Border Patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all-time highs, though there was a slight downward turn in January, as is often the case, according the latest government figures. Customs and Border Protection said more than 1,800 Central American parents and children crossed the border illegally on Monday, the largest number of families recorded on a single day. And like other asylum policies of this administration, the “remain in Mexico” policy has already drawn legal scrutiny, leaving its future uncertain. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in Mexico, claiming that the policy, which was introduced last month at the San Ysidro port of entry, near San Diego, violates United States and international laws. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who feared for their lives in Mexico, according to the complaint. One of them was robbed at gunpoint and told by the assailant that he would be killed if he was seen again. Two others said that they had been threatened by local residents wielding rocks or sticks. Another plaintiff said he had to bribe a police officer to avoid arrest. “Asylum seekers in Mexico face a heightened risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, sexual assault and murder, among other harms,” said the complaint. In December, the A.C.L.U. successfully sued the administration over another new rule that became known as the “asylum ban” because it significantly restricted the locations where people could request the status. That policy remains enjoined by a federal court; the Supreme Court declined to reinstate it. Like members of the caravan, many of those who continue to come to the United States each day lack a comprehensive understanding of the system they are entering. Ela Marina Rodriguez, 49, and her daughter, Duña Ventura, 16, arrived in Tijuana about three weeks ago and were taken to the small shelter by a man whom they had been traveling with. Ms. Rodriguez said she had heard on the news that bringing her daughter would guarantee them admission into the United States, and the two thought if they could make it through the journey they would have an opportunity for a better life. “That’s why we came all this way,” she said. “I’ve dreamed of doing this my entire life but I was afraid. Hiding through the desert and the mountains, I never had the courage before, until we heard they were giving papers to families.” Her eyes grew wide when she heard from a reporter that some asylum seekers are being made to wait in Mexico. She sighed heavily and replied: “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t want to be here.” Ms. Rodriguez said that “honestly, yes” she would cross illegally if that is what it takes to get into the United States. But if she is unable to gain entry to the United States, she said, she would likely turn back to Honduras. “I mean, what else can you do in that case?”    Advertisement

---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tax-refunds-gop-law_n_5c671dcee4b033a799429900---split---Republicans boasted all last year that their new tax law boosted paychecks and showered bonuses on several million workers. But now that tax season is upon us, several million Americans are getting a nasty surprise: a bill from the Internal Revenue Service that they never expected. Beth Callori of Long Island, New York, said she was thrilled to receive about $90 more in each paycheck last year. Thanks to the new lower federal income tax rates, Callori’s employer, a financial services firm, was withholding less from her paycheck for federal tax purposes. “I thought, ‘Wow, Trump is great, I love him,’” Callori said. But last week Callori heard from her tax preparer that she owes the federal government more than $5,000 ― almost five times as much as she had to pay in previous years. “I almost fell out of my chair. I could not believe it,” she said. “I voted for Trump. I thought he was going to be good for this country, but when I got that phone call, that’s it, I’m done.” Callori’s tax bill went up for two reasons. One is that the law directly disadvantaged her by limiting deductions for state and local taxes, which increased the amount of Callori’s income subject to tax and added an extra grand to her bill. The bigger reason is that her employer withheld too little from her paycheck. The extra $90 she received should have been added to the amount that gets automatically socked away to cover the federal income tax. Like most people, however, Callori did not fill out a worksheet and submit a new Form W-4 to her employer at the beginning of last year. After all, at that time Republicans kept bragging about the bigger paychecks they had given the American people. “I thought because I was getting that, I’m entitled to it,” Callori said. The vast majority of Americans got lower taxes from the new law, while only 5 percent or so should have seen a tax increase. Most people should have seen the changes in their paychecks last February. But the way the Trump administration implemented the law has caused a separate problem ― one that the administration knew would result in something like 5 million fewer households receiving tax refunds this year. It’s still early in tax filing season, which opened at the end of January, but the average refund is down 8.7 percent so far. The Treasury Department suggested tax refunds are bad anyway because they result from people overpaying the government. “Smaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers,” a spokesperson said in an email. The problem is, it’s not just smaller refunds ― it’s that paycheck withholding for this tax season is less accurate in general. Treasury has said it expected the percentage of people withholding too much tax in their paychecks to decline from 76 to 73 percent, but the percentage withholding accurately is not increasing at all. Instead, Treasury expected the rate of under-withholding to go from 18 to 21 percent. Those people all owe the IRS. The households most at risk are ones with higher incomes, two earners and slightly more complicated taxes ― especially households that used to itemize their deductions. Instead of taking the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by a set value, itemizers would add up what they spent on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving, and deduct that sum instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the advantage of itemizing and limited the deduction for state and local tax. But the Trump administration decided not to make major changes to the withholding tables that employers are required to use to make sure everybody is paying the right amount of tax. The value of “allowances” that workers can choose on Form W-4 to adjust their withholding has been pegged for years to something called the personal exemption ― which the new tax law eliminated. So they set the value of allowances to last year’s personal exemption and adjusted for inflation. Coming up with new forms would have taken at least half a year, and would have been a chore for everyone. “There’s this tension … You’d like to get all the information needed to calculate withholding as accurately as possible, but that gets very complicated for taxpayers,” said Joe Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center. The administration could have let people withhold too much rather than surprise them with bills at tax time, Democrats have said. “It looks like the Trump Treasury Department spent 2018, an election year, goosing people’s paychecks by under-withholding, and it should have been obvious that the bill would come due eventually,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Friday. The IRS did try to warn people to check their withholding. The agency told the Government Accountability Office that it put out press releases and sent emails to listservs with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It promoted a “paycheck checkup” campaign on Twitter and Facebook, and officials talked to the media. The “make sure you’re not underwithheld” messaging may have been drowned out by congressional Republicans bragging that their law had turbocharged the economy and directly benefited millions of workers. They kept a running tally of the hundreds of firms that had announced bonuses for their employees, trumpeting each announcement in a series of press releases. Fox News worked overtime to remind people that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously called the bonuses “crumbs,” as though that weren’t a perfectly accurate description. Another problem, which is not Republicans’ fault, is that even though everyone pays taxes, not everyone understands them very well. Less than half of Americans said they knew they could update their W-4 forms at any time and only 19 percent had actually done so, according to a November survey by the tax prep company H&R Block. Twice as many survey respondents said they updated their W-2, which is actually a document prepared by employers, not workers. Also, some filers are surprised by tax bills simply because they didn’t realize some of the money they earned needed to be taxed. “They’ll have some side job where there’s no withholding and that’s creating this new tax liability,” H&R Block’s Nathan Rigney said, pointing to the rise of non-employee gigs like Uber and Taskrabbit. By capping deductions for state and local taxes, Republicans knew the tax hikes in their law would be concentrated on states with high taxes ― which tend to be led by Democrats, who use the taxes to provide more social services. But it’s not just wealthy New Yorkers who’ve wound up paying more. Kurt Kromm is an electrician in Kenosha, Wisconsin ― an area that used to be represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Kromm knew he and his wife would pay higher taxes because of the limit on deductions for state and local taxes, but he didn’t think they would owe more than $4,000 this spring. Kromm had already indicated on the Form W-4 documents he’d previously submitted to his employer that he was married and wanted zero allowances, which means he was withholding as much as he could without specifying an additional dollar amount. “I figured married and zero would probably be appropriate,” Kromm said. “They spent no time trying to really put out a decent withholding table.” Kromm’s case shows the two-earner household pitfall. After he realized how much he owes, he went to the withholding calculator on IRS.gov and realized he could have either told his employer to take an additional $80 per week or just chosen to withhold at a single rate on his W-4, since single people face higher rates and therefore higher withholding. If he had done so last year, he could have had less money in each paycheck but saved himself the aggravation of making a large payment. But not even the administration expected people to go to such lengths ― in its simulations of how people would be affected, the IRS assumed nobody would adjust their W-4s. “It’s unreasonable to expect working people with busy lives to start the year out by crunching the numbers on their tax withholding with the rigor of a workaholic [certified public accountant],” Wyden said. Beth Callori, for her part, said she had also previously chosen zero allowances ― plus she had an extra $130 withheld from each paycheck. It wasn’t enough. She said she used to love Donald Trump. Not anymore. “I really liked things he was doing, until this, and now I hate him,” she said. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trade-talks-with-china-intensive-but-tariffs-still-set-to-balloon-on-march-1-wh-says---split---U.S. and Chinese officials made “progress” in trade talks this week in Beijing, the White House said. But spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not provide details as a new round of talks is slated for next week in Washington. (Lintao Zhang/Getty Images file photo) The White House on Friday said “intensive” trade talks this week with Chinese officials yielded “progress,” but there was no indication President Donald Trump is ready to delay a substantial ballooning of tariffs on Chinese-made goods set to take effect March 1. “These detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “Much work remains, however.” The latter assessment reflects what top White House officials have said for months: on major issues like Chinese government subsidies to its firms, U.S. companies’ intellectual property rights and a handful of others, Beijing has never budged months during nearly two years of high-level talks. [Trump’s executive order will tap $6.6. billion in Pentagon, Treasury funds for wall, source says] This week’s round of talks in China, like others have focused on those issues and others like forced technology transfers demanded of U.S. companies, forced joint ventures, non-tariff barriers on agricultural and industrial goods, and cybersecurity matters. “It’s the same list,” a clearly frustrated White House chief economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told reporters in late November. “We haven’t seen much change.” Since, Kudlow and others have promised reporters new rounds of talks have yielded “progress,” but they decline to provide specifics. That language was back Friday, with the top White House spokeswoman saying “the United States looks forward to these further talks and hopes to see additional progress,” referring to a new round next week in Washington. Trump earlier this week said he would consider pushing back a deadline in just 14 days at which time U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods will swell from 10 percent to 25 percent if he thinks talks are moving toward a deal. But Sanders gave no indication Friday that he is ready to make that move, a sign he sees it as leverage for his team of negotiators. [Legal fight expected for Trump’s national emergency declaration] “Both sides will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the March 1, 2019, deadline for an increase in the 10 percent tariff on certain imported Chinese goods,” Sanders said. Lawmakers have both applauded the Trump administration for its tough stance on China’s trade practices and urged the president to resist an all-out trade war that could drive the American and global economies into a recession. Report language in the spending package Trump is slated to sign Friday morning tells the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office it “shall” create a process for businesses to seek tariff exemptions for imported products affected by U.S. duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods. The agency has said it would create an exemption process if U.S.-China trade talks fail, prompting the tariffs to increase to 25 percent. White House officials said earlier this month that any U.S.-China trade pact would not be required to get congressional approval, but they said they are keeping key lawmakers updated on the talks. Trump campaigned on getting tougher on Beijing in 2016, and brings it up at his political rallies as he gears up for a re-election fight. Ellyn Ferguson contributed to this report.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html---split---Supported by The president plans to manage the border crisis from the golf course at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. “I didn’t need to do this,” President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall. The president’s assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is “very very on its way,” the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, “But I’d rather do it much faster.” A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis — no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures. In reality, the wall is not a done deal, and Mr. Trump has spent the past few months — the past two years, really — failing to convince either Congress or Mexico to pay for it. This week’s bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat. Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the military’s drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to “backfill” the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets. And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall. Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles. He predicted that the move would prompt swift legal pushback, which it did. Less than four hours after the announcement, a government watchdog group filed suit, demanding that the Department of Justice hand over “documents concerning the legal authority of the president to invoke emergency powers.” Soon after, the State of California announced its intention to sue. On Thursday, even before the announcement, Protect Democracy and the Niskanen Center announced plans to file on behalf of El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights. So the floodgates are open. Mr. Trump predicted that he would lose the first couple of court rounds, particularly in California federal courts, but would ultimately be vindicated by the Supreme Court. Critics of the move expect things to turn out differently. Whatever the outcome, the legal issues are complex, and the case could wind up bogged down indefinitely, meaning not much wall for now. Moving from the legal to the political realm, Republican lawmakers will very likely to find themselves in a pickle. Congress has the power to override a national emergency declaration by passing a joint resolution. To prevent opponents from stalling the bill indefinitely, once one chamber passes the resolution, the other must hold a vote on it within 18 calendar days. House Democrats have already announced their intention to hold such a vote, and are expected to prevail. This will then put Senate Republicans in the position of having to vote on whether to support a presidential grab of Congress’s power. To survive a presidential veto, such a measure would need to pass with two thirds of the votes in both chambers — which seems unlikely. But the vote itself will prove awkward for Republicans, forcing them to go on record as to whether they have officially abandoned their constitutional duties. Then there’s the violence this will do the budget process — not exactly a smooth-running machine as is. But if members of Congress start worrying that money appropriated for one purpose will be clawed back by the White House and handed over for a different one, look for spending battles to get bloodier still. Some of the money to be raided for the wall will come from military construction projects in Republican states like Kentucky and North Carolina. Which brings us to the question of precedent. In defending his declaration, Mr. Trump and his team keep asserting that emergency declarations are not unusual. The president called them “a great thing” that other presidents have done “many, many times.” Since 1976, such declarations have been used 59 times. But most have been uncontroversial and involved matters of foreign policy. Declaring an emergency simply because Congress refused to fund the president’s pet project is seen even by members of his own party as setting a dangerous precedent. As Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, warned, “For the president to use it to repurpose billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated for other purposes and that he has previously signed into law, strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the vote of Congress and being of dubious constitutionality.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi raised broader issues on Friday. “This issue transcends partisan politics and goes to the core of the Founders’ conception for America, which commands Congress to limit an overreaching executive,” she said in a statement with Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. “The president’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our Founders’ vision.” “We call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution,” they added. “The Congress cannot let the president shred the Constitution.” Mr. Trump betrays no interest in the collateral damage wreaked by his actions. This move will come back to bite him and his party. The question is when, and how hard. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/mcconnell-trump-will-sign-spending-bill-declare-national-emergency---split---President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrive for lunch with Senate Republicans in the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2018. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) The big bipartisan government funding deal is going to become law, but it will be far from the end of the border security battle between President Donald Trump and members of Congress. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Thursday that Trump intends to sign the spending conference report, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had indicated earlier. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” she said in a statement. “The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.” Confirmation from the White House spokeswoman came after McConnell said Trump had told him he would sign the conference report into law, along with the emergency declaration. Watch: What is a national emergency? How Congress gave the White House broad, far-reaching powers “I had an opportunity to speak with President Trump and he, I would say to all my colleagues, has indicated he's prepared to sign the bill,” the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor. “He also will be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. I indicated I’m going to support the national emergency declaration.” With the assurances that Trump would put his signature on the appropriations package, the Senate quickly moved ahead, adopting the conference report on an 83-16 vote. Following the McConnell announcement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed that the $333 billion, seven-bill appropriations package to finish off fiscal 2019, would also move ahead in the House later Thursday. “We’ll vote on it later today,” the California Democrat said of the fiscal 2019 appropriations package. “So that’s real progress for us to have left it to the appropriators to make the decisions.” Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans “It’s gonna pass,” House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn said of the omnibus spending package. “I hope it would be a strong bipartisan vote, [that] is what I would like to see.” The South Carolina Democrat said he had been in contact with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana about this evening’s vote. “So the two of us are working together, trying to come up with a strong bipartisan vote for this bill. It will pass. I would hate to predict how many he will have, I think I know about how many I have on this side,” Clyburn said. Lindsey McPherson and Doug Sword contributed to this report.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rem-everybody-hurts-meme_n_5c67bcb7e4b033a79942db5f---split---The members of former American rock band R.E.M. have made it crystal clear how they feel about President Donald Trump’s sharing of a meme mocking Democrats, which featured one of their most iconic songs. Trump shared the video, which was set to the group’s 1992 hit “Everybody Hurts,” on Friday. It poked fun at the expressions of Democratic lawmakers during Trump’s State of the Union address earlier this month. pic.twitter.com/BliAo5YDqb Mike Mills, who was the group’s bassist, responded with a series of blistering tweets. He dubbed Trump “PresidentAsshole,” called out the pro-Trump Twitter account that created the meme and said “measures have been taken” to stop the circulation of the clip. The assholes @CarpeDonktum created the meme. #PresidentAsshole retweeted it. Measures have been taken to stop it. @jack you need to get on this. The band’s official Twitter account also weighed in, calling Trump “World Leader PRETEND!!!” World Leader PRETEND!!! Congress, Media--ghost this faker!!! Love, R.E.M. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/KlqXrvRZ4D CNBC reported early Saturday that Twitter had disabled the video, at the request of lawyers from Universal Music Publishing Group, which owns the publishing rights to the song. The meme’s creator called the move “censorship.” Multiple musicians and groups have criticized Trump for using their songs without permission at his campaign rallies — including The Rolling Stones, Rihanna, Guns N’ Roses and Aerosmith. R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe himself, in 2015, also instructed Trump to “not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.”
---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/democrats-will-push-back-on-national-emergency-in-congress-and-courts-pelosi-schumer-say---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats will push back against the president's national emergency declaration in Congress, the courts and the public. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer promise that Democrats in Congress — hopefully joined by some Republicans — will push back against President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration in multiple arenas. “The President’s actions clearly violate the Congress’ exclusive power of the purse, which our founders enshrined in the Constitution,” the duo said in a joint statement Friday. “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.” Pelosi and Schumer did not provide specifics regarding the actions they’ll take. But there’s already talk of the House passing a resolution of disapproval, rejecting the emergency declaration. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, presidents can take extraordinary actions in times of crisis by declaring a national emergency. A joint resolution disapproving of action under the 1976 law would be considered “privileged” and can be passed with a simple majority vote in each chamber. The privileged status of such a resolution would allow Senate Democrats to force a floor vote over objections of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Thursday he supports Trump’s decision. During a Rose Garden announcement Friday, Trump said he would sign a national emergency declaration stating there’s a crisis at the southern border. He plans to shift $3.5 billion from the Defense Department’s military construction fund to the border barrier project. “The President’s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process.” The Democratic leaders’ promise that Congress will respond in the courts comes as no surprise to the administration. Trump said Friday he expects to get sued and even to get an initial “bad ruling,” but he expressed confidence the Supreme Court will uphold his declaration. Democrats are likely to coordinate legal action with states and local governments — and potentially, outside interest groups —that will want to sue Trump over the declaration. “The president’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our founders’ vision,” Pelosi and Schumer said. Some Republicans have said they do not support Trump using an emergency declaration to go around Congress. But it’s unclear whether they feel strongly enough to get involved in any court action, or to support a resolution of disapproval. Pelosi and Schumer are hoping they will, saying, “We call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution. Just as both parties honored our oath to protect the American people by passing the conference committee bill, the Congress on a bipartisan basis must honor the Constitution by defending our system of checks and balances.” The Democratic leaders’ statement focused on Trump’s national emergency declaration. It was not immediately clear if they will also seek to challenge his authority to use other executive actions to shift additional money toward the border barrier project. The Trump administration is planning actions that would divert $2.5 billion from the Pentagon’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury Department drug forfeiture program. White House officials said Friday those funds will “back-filled” in Trump’s fiscal 2020 budget request. John T. Bennett, David Lerman and Niels Lewsniewski contributed to this report.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-mar-a-lago-national-emergency_n_5c67ff8ce4b05c889d1fadcc---split---Just hours after declaring a national emergency on border security, President Donald Trump headed to his Mar-a-Lago resort, marking his 223rd day on one of his properties. NBC News determined the tally, which it has been keeping since Trump’s inauguration. Of the 223 days, the president has spent 168 at his golf courses. Trump flew down to Florida on Friday following his Rose Garden speech announcing the emergency declaration, meant to access billions in additional funding for border wall construction. He also signed a congressional spending plan that day to avoid a second government shutdown. The deal allocates $1.375 billion to the southern barrier. However, Trump argued in his speech that more was needed, claiming there was a crisis of drugs and crime pouring into the U.S. The president’s trip came as a surprise to some Twitter users, who were baffled that amid a supposed emergency, Trump was heading out of the White House: They posed for this picture, then Trump got on a plane to Mar-a-lago. Some emergency If our country is in a State of Emergency, why is @realDonaldTrump boarding a plane to Mar-a-lago with his wife this afternoon? If the security of our nation sits in the balance, why is he spending the week golfing with his buddies? Interesting optics on Friday as Trump, according to the W.H. schedule, declares a national emergency at the southern border and then jets off to Mar-a-Lago a few hours later. I thought there was some kind of emergency, but I guess not since Trump is living it up at Mar-a-Lago. https://t.co/KePpeWdbNb A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office last month indicates federal agencies spent roughly $13.6 million on just four of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips. The bulk of the costs were incurred by the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, paying for $5.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively.

---split---10.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/waiting-for-sam-ervin---split---Folksy North Carolina Sen. Sam Ervin, center, chaired the committee that destroyed Nixon’s strongest claim to power — his political popularity, Shapiro writes. (CQ Roll Call file photo) OPINION — It is easy to imagine an undiscovered Samuel Beckett play entitled “Waiting for Mueller.” On stage, faithful Democrats vacillate between stubborn hope (“He should be here”) and fatalistic despair (“He didn’t say for sure that he would come”). In the end, they just wait, day after day. Whatever Robert Mueller’s internal timetable (seers like Rudy Giuliani have so far been comically wrong in trying to predict it), the investigation will face new pressures with the virtually certain Senate confirmation this week of William Barr. For the first time, Mueller will be supervised by a legitimate attorney general — rather than an acting Donald Trump factotum — who has avoided any promises about releasing the full report. All of this might be ominous for Mueller were it not for existence of Democratic House committee chairmen armed with subpoena power. Jerry Nadler, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, just pointedly announced the appointment of two high-profile Trump critics (Norman Eisen and Barry Berke) as legal consultants. At moments like this, it is tempting to dust off Watergate parallels from the Saturday Night Massacre (Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox) to the House Judiciary impeachment vote that helped precipitate Nixon’s resignation. But there are major differences between Trump’s current troubles and Nixon’s resignation beyond the existence of a presidential Twitter account and capital-letter tweets wailing and railing about a “WITCH HUNT.” Trump’s behavior, from his fan-boy embrace of Vladimir Putin to his cynical profiteering from his hotel empire in the White House, has never been subject to sustained congressional scrutiny. Fired FBI Director James Comey’s June 2017 appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee remains the most dramatic congressional hearing about Trump’s conduct in the Oval Office. In dramatic contrast, the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, chaired by folksy North Carolina Democrat Sam Ervin, paved the way for Nixon’s downfall. For 51 days from May until November 1973, Americans of all political persuasions were riveted by the Ervin hearings that were broadcast gavel-to-gavel and repeated in the evenings on PBS. According to the Gallup Poll, more than 70 percent of Americans watched at least part of the hearings. Watch: How does impeachment work? The hearings had everything, including the stunning revelation by Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield that the president had a taping system for recording conversations in the Oval Office. The parade of witnesses included comic characters like tough-talking retired New York City detective Tony Ulasewicz, who recounted his adventures as a Nixon bagman delivering cash payoffs to the plotters behind the Watergate break-in. But the hearings were mostly defined by gravely serious witnesses like former White House counsel John Dean, who testified about telling Nixon, “There was a cancer growing on the presidency and that if the cancer was not removed, then the president himself would be killed by it.” (I should mention that the idea for this column was triggered by a recent conversation with Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Martin Luther King biographer. More relevant, Branch was the ghostwriter for Dean’s bestselling Watergate confessional, “Blind Ambition.”) The Ervin committee hearings destroyed Nixon’s strongest claim to power — his political popularity. At the beginning of 1973, fresh off his 49-state sweep against George McGovern, Nixon boasted a lofty approval rating of 68 percent. By August 1973, Nixon had lost more than half his supporters, with the Gallup Poll clocking him in at a dismal 31 percent. Although Nixon survived in the White House for another year, his approval rating never again came close to 40 percent. Despite a mostly buoyant economy, Trump’s own approval rating has been bouncing along for months just over 40 percent. But for all the attention devoted to the Mueller investigation in Washington, there remains a level of abstraction surrounding it. It’s like a battle scene in Shakespeare when everything is occurring offstage — and the audience just gets periodic bulletins from messengers and wounded soldiers. While nothing is certain, the odds seem high that Trump’s popularity would take a major hit if Americans got to view protracted public testimony from the likes of Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and, yes, Jared Kushner. Whether the topic were plans for the Trump Tower in Moscow or campaign payoffs to the president’s purported paramours, it would be hard for honest Republicans to dismiss such a tawdry parade of Trump associates as “fake news.” But a dramatic set of congressional hearings needs more than just a compelling roster of witnesses. Part of the secret of the success of the Ervin committee was that, as a select Senate body, it was limited to just seven hand-picked members. As a result, senators could pursue their inquiries without being tongue-tied by arbitrary time limits. Nadler’s Judiciary Committee, in contrast, has (gulp) 41 members. Unless committee Democrats are willing to subordinate their political egos for a larger cause, there would be no way to follow a consistent line of inquiry in the face of expected GOP obstruction. Maybe the solution would be for Nancy Pelosi to appoint a small select committee on the Watergate model. Or maybe the bulk of the questioning before the Judiciary and similar committees should be handled by senior staffers and outside attorneys rather than individual legislators preening during their five minutes on camera. All predictions about Trump’s future have to be balanced against the reality that House Democrats are planning what they hope will be the most explosive set of congressional hearings in nearly half a century. These hearings may prove as politically important as the Mueller report itself. Which is why there may be still another Beckett play called “Waiting for Nadler.” Walter Shapiro has covered the last 10 presidential campaigns.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/trump-national-emergency-data-doesnt-exist/---split---Toward the end of a White House press conference Friday morning, during which President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in order to secure up to $8 billion in funding for a border wall, White House reporter Brian Karem stood to ask the president a single question: “What do you base your facts on?” It was the most clarifying question in an hour-long display that at times felt as hard to grasp as a slinky. During his remarks, President Trump repeatedly called into question and even dismissed as lies much of the available data that exists on immigration and crime, all while glorifying countries like China that give drug dealers the death penalty and painting a picture of a country under siege by criminal invaders. So, Karem asked, what is that picture based on? President Trump responded in generalities. “I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. The numbers I have from Homeland Security are a disaster,” he said. Asked to clarify what numbers he’s referring to, Trump said, “I use many stats.” https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1096478979178008576 One possible reason President Trump may have had trouble producing those stats? They don’t really exist. Again and again throughout his remarks, and throughout his years-long battle to build a wall on the southern border, President Trump has relied, instead, on anecdotes, highlighting, for example, the heartbreaking stories of mothers whose children have been killed by undocumented immigrants or noting, as he did during the press conference, individual examples of people being killed on the border last week. These stories confirm President Trump’s stated belief that something new and dangerous is taking place on the border, and so he holds up them up as all the proof the American public needs that he's right. But as the saying goes, the plural of anecdote is not data. The government's own data, instead, suggest just the opposite of what the president needs the country to believe in order to fulfill his chief campaign promise and build a border wall. “His speech basically repeated every falsehood, every misconception, and every untruth that has been stated about the border and illegal immigrant crime and national security threats involving immigration for the last several years,” says Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at libertarian think tank Cato Institute. Take the president’s suggestion on Friday that a disproportionately high number of undocumented people make up the federal prison population. According to a Department of Justice report released last June, about 20 percent of the federal prison population in the first quarter of 2018 were “known or suspected aliens,” and 93 percent of them were in the country illegally. The Federal Bureau of Prisons told WIRED on Friday that "19.3 percent of the BOP's inmates have either unknown or non-US citizenship," which, of course, includes a far broader category of immigrants than only the undocumented ones. But the demographics of the federal prison population are hardly a fair proxy for the country as a whole. As the DOJ’s report states, 90 percent of the incarcerated population in the US resides in state and local prisons, and the rate of undocumented people in state and local prisons is far harder to calculate, as few states report those statistics. In Texas, one state that does calculate these figures, a Cato report found that in 2015, "as a percentage of their respective populations, there were 50 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans." In addition, immigration offenses are themselves federal offenses. It stands to reason, then, that people serving time for immigration offenses would be overrepresented in the prisons where people serve time for immigration offenses. The DOJ report doesn’t state what percentage of undocumented immigrants are in federal prison for violence or drug charges. Neither did President Trump. Then there’s the president’s insistence that Democrats are lying when they say ports of entry, and not the southern border, are most responsible for drug smuggling. But in November of 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration reported exactly that. “The most common method employed by these [transnational criminal organizations] involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. [ports of entry] in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers,” the report reads. The president's bleak description of rampant violence along the border also stands in stark contrast to what the Federal Bureau of Investigation's statistics show, Nowrasteh says. According to FBI crime reports obtained by Cato, in 2017, the violent crime rate, property crime rate, and homicide rate were lower along border counties than they were in the United States writ large. Not only that, but according to Customs and Border Patrol, in 2018 gang members accounted for just .2 percent of all apprehensions at the border. "Those numbers would be very different if there was a real invasion," Nowrasteh says. Such willful distorting of data in the service of stoking fear about a group of people has scary historical precedents, says Jason Stanley, a philosophy professor at Yale University and author of the book How Fascism Works. "He's saying data doesn't matter. He’s saying, 'This is about my power,'" Stanley says. "It’s a sign of power that you can declare a national emergency without there being one." Before President Trump even completed his address, he anticipated the ways in which that power may be checked. "We will have a national emergency, and we’ll then be sued," he said, expressing full confidence that the Supreme Court would eventually uphold his declaration. Hours later, the American Civil Liberties Union announced its plans to file a lawsuit early next week, arguing that the president's actions are "unprecedented." “By the president’s very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency. He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress, and decided to move along his promise for a border wall ‘faster,'" the ACLU's staff attorney, Dror Ladin, wrote in a statement. "This is a patently illegal power grab that hurts American communities and flouts the checks and balances that are hallmarks of our democracy." The data may not matter to the White House. Now we'll see if it matters to the courts. Immigrants founded half of the billion dollar startups in the US. Now many worry that Trump's current travel ban and any future restrictions to work visas could hamper growth in Silicon Valley. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coulter-trump-idiot-president_n_5c6790fee4b033a79942d002---split---Ann Coulter cranked up her battle with Donald Trump again Friday with another broadside about his border wall tactics. The conservative commentator declared that the “only national emergency is that our president is an idiot.” Trump scrambled earlier Friday to distance himself from her and her vitriolic comments about him, claiming in a Rose Garden address Friday, to everyone’s surprise: “Ann Coulter, I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” In the announcement of his national emergency declaration to divert funding for the wall, he added that Coulter had “gone off the reservation” in her increasingly harsh criticism of him. “Thank God [Trump has] relieved me of any responsibility for what he’s been doing,” Coulter said on KABC-AM’s “Morning Drive” program in Los Angeles on Friday, just minutes after Trump’s comments. “That was the biggest favor anyone could do me today.” The Mexican border wall was “the promise he made every single day at every single speech. Forget the fact that he’s digging his own grave,” she added. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot.” Coulter, a onetime major Trump backer who wrote the book In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome, is convinced the president’s declaration of a national emergency is a “scam,” and that he’ll never build the cement wall he vowed to erect. Trump also tried to distance himself from Fox News host Sean Hannity and from criticism that he is Trump’s shadow president. Hannity had been urging Trump to declare a national emergency to begin building the border wall. “Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,” Trump said, but he insisted that right-wing pundits “don’t decide policy.” As for Coulter’s apparently former influence, MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle said just last month that Trump wouldn’t budge on his commitment to the border wall because right-wing pundits like Coulter would rile up his base. He doesn’t want to be called a “fraud and a weenie” by Coulter, Ruhle declared. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---11.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-may-vote-on-resolution-to-disapprove-of-national-emergency---split---Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., said the House will vote on a resolution to disapprove of President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency to build the wall. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Updated 9:34 p.m. | The House will vote on a resolution of disapproval that would push back on President Donald Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency to free up more funds for a wall along the southern border, according to New York Democrat Nydia M. Velázquez. But a leadership aide said no such decision about a vote has been made. Velázquez said the timing of the vote had not yet been settled on but added that the disapproval resolution sponsored by Texas Democrat Joaquin Castro would be the first vote taken. Castro, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement that he was “prepared to introduce a resolution to terminate the President’s emergency declaration under 50 U.S.C. 1622. (National Emergencies Act)” if Trump made such a move. Velázquez also noted that there are discussions about moving other bills such as one she introduced to prevent money Congress appropriated for disaster relief from being used for the wall. The aide said it would be impossible for leaders to decide a path forward until they see what Trump does. Trump hasn’t yet declared a national emergency but is expected to do so Friday as he signs the fiscal 2019 appropriations package Congress is preparing to send him Thursday night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday that Democrats will weigh their options for a response, including taking legal action. She was asked about the possibility of scheduling a vote that would put Republicans on record over Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency but declined to confirm if she would do that. “I don’t believe that there’s any good faith negotiations to have with the Republicans in Congress if they’re going to support the president doing an end-run about what the will of the people, the Congress of the United States, has put forth,” the California Democrat said. “So we will review our options and I’m not prepared to give any preference to any one of them right now.” Velázquez, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico, is concerned that Trump may use the national emergency declaration to take money from the relief effort to help the U.S. territory with its recovery from the 2017 hurricanes that ravaged the island. “There is not a national emergency at our border,” she said Thursday, appealing directly to Trump. “A national emergency is when 3.4 million American citizens endure the longest blackout on American history after a hurricane. … A national emergency is what your administration caused in Puerto Rico.” Velázquez spoke alongside a handful of Democrats from California and New York in opposition to the national emergency. Rep. John Garamendi mentioned several Army Corps of Engineer projects in California that Trump may target. He also has a bill that would prevent Trump from raiding disaster relief funds. In addition to legislative action, the members said that they expected a coordinated legal response from Democrats inside and outside Congress and that the state of California was likely to be involved. “There appears to be plenty of opportunities for lawsuits here,” Garamendi said, noting there’s been discussion of that at the leadership level. Pelosi said she “may” mount a legal challenge against the declaration but did not not want to commit to anything until seeing Trump’s explanation for his action.

---split---13.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/books/review-threat-fbi-trump-andrew-mccabe.html---split---Supported by Books of The Times By Dwight Garner On the back cover of his new book, “The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,” Andrew G. McCabe looks preposterously fit (he competes in triathlons). His hands are at his hips, gunslinger style. It’s as if he were a kind High Plains sheriff who had stumbled upon an intolerable rodeo of villainy. McCabe’s prose is lean, too. (Not that he wrote this book. In his acknowledgments, he thanks “a great writing and editing team.”) The first sentence demands to be read in the voice of Jack Webb from “Dragnet”: “Between the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law.” McCabe is, of course, the former deputy director of the F.B.I. who was fired last March, just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. He was briefly the F.B.I.’s acting director, after the dismissal of James B. Comey. The president hooted on Twitter: “Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the F.B.I. — A great day for Democracy.” This lawman, a registered Republican for the entirety of his adult life, may have been driven out of Dodge. But he has dusted off his white hat and returned with a memoir that’s better than any book typed this quickly has a right to be. “The Threat” is a concise yet substantive account of how the F.B.I. works, at a moment when its procedures and impartiality are under attack. It’s an unambiguous indictment of Trump’s moral behavior. “Let me state the proposition openly,” McCabe writes. “The work of the F.B.I. is being undermined by the current president.” It’s a rapid-fire G-man memoir, moving from the author’s training in Quantico (shades of “The Silence of the Lambs”) through his experiences chasing the Russian mob, the Boston Marathon bombers and others. The book is patriotic and oddly stirring. It has moments of opacity, where you feel he is holding back at crucial moments, but it is filled with disturbingly piquant details. McCabe made headlines after a recent “60 Minutes” interview, during which he reported that top Justice Department officials, disquieted by Trump’s firing of Comey, discussed trying to encourage cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. He also confirmed a New York Times report that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, offered to wear a wire during his meetings with Trump. These stories, frustratingly, were in the TV interview but are not in this book. But there are many other gleanings. McCabe’s accounts of his baffled interactions with Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, would be high comedy if they were not so dire. They are a highlight, or a lowlight, of this book. We see a Sessions who is openly racist. “Back in the old days,” he says to the author about the F.B.I., “you all only hired Irishmen. They were drunks, but they could be trusted.” Sessions seemed not to read his daily briefings. He had “trouble focusing” and “seemed to lack basic knowledge about the jurisdictions of various arms of federal law enforcement.” Sessions concentrated almost solely on the immigration aspect of any issue, McCabe writes, even when there was no immigration aspect. Similarly, “Sessions spent a lot of time yelling at us about the death penalty, despite the fact that the F.B.I. plays no role of any kind in whether to seek the death penalty.” The portrait of Sessions is of a man for whom merely ordering lunch seems to be above the timberline of his intellect and curiosity. A recent cartoon in The New Yorker depicted a person feverishly covering two walls with a link chart, with names and Scotch tape and Magic Marker, of the Trump administration’s alleged misdeeds. Another person stands watching from a doorway. The caption is: “Hon, Mueller’s got this. Come to bed.” It turns out that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has strong opinions about charts. McCabe worked under him at the bureau. “He detested diagonal lines,” McCabe writes. “Some colors he liked. Some he didn’t.” McCabe explains the reasons for these preferences. He writes about Mueller: “Sometimes he would take out the chart and suddenly you would see his face fall, as if to say the kind of thing that he would rarely say: Who made this piece of crap?” Mueller is, in this book, the Mueller we have come to know: punctual, determined, the antithesis of casual, with a special loathing for people who speak when they don’t know what they are talking about. “Ball-busting is his way of expressing affection,” McCabe writes. “If he said, Where does a person even find a tie like that? I knew things were fine: He never went out of his way to insult anyone he didn’t actually like.” McCabe’s memoir joins a roster of recent and alarming books by high-ranking members of the United States’ justice and intelligence communities, each pushing back sharply against the president’s war on facts and competence. These books include Comey’s “A Higher Loyalty” as well as “The Assault on Intelligence,” by Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the National Security Agency, and “Facts and Fears,” by James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, written with Trey Brown. Each is its own Paul Revere ride of warning. Each is a reminder that we will be reading about Trump and his administration for the rest of our lives, for the exact opposite reason that we will also be reading about Lincoln and his for the rest of our lives. There’s much more in McCabe’s book. He’s good on things like what it’s like to take a polygraph test, and the fastest way to take off a seatbelt. He wades back through the big muddy of the Benghazi hearings. He writes of his fears about the increasing use of encryption. He spends a good deal of time talking about Hillary Clinton and her email server. He argues that Comey, whom he admires, made crucial mistakes in how he handled the matter. “As a matter of policy, the F.B.I. does everything possible not to influence elections. In 2016, it seems we did.” He recounts the attacks on his credibility, by Trump and others, after his wife, Jill, ran for Virginia’s State Senate as a Democrat in 2015. He hurt his own credibility, according to the F.B.I. inspector general, by making false statements about his contacts with the media. The Trump-bashing texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, his F.B.I. subordinates, did something worse: They cast doubts about the impartiality of the agency. McCabe rushes past this material too swiftly. Yet if McCabe has made mistakes, his basic decency shines through in this memoir. He adds to our understanding of how deeply Trump remains under Vladimir Putin’s sway. After a North Korean ballistic missile test, Trump told an F.B.I. briefer that reports of the test were a hoax. McCabe writes, incredulously: “He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so.” About Trump, the author asks, “What more could a person do to erode the credibility of the presidency?” He watches this moral limbo dancer go lower and lower. Yet he sees the president as a symptom as much as a disease. “When is the right time,” he asks, “to give up on people’s general ability to understand any slightly complicated statement that they don’t agree with?” Follow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner.

---split---14.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/trumps-executive-order-will-tap-8-billion-in-pentagon-treasury-funds-for-wall-source-says---split---President Donald Trump talks to reporters during a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Senior White House officials said Friday that the funds President Donald Trump will take from the Pentagon and the Treasury Department to pay for his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border would be “back-filled” in his 2020 budget request. That means U.S. taxpayers would pay for every penny of the wall in fiscal 2019 — even though Trump long promised that Mexico would pay for it. Trump is using his executive authorities to move $2.5 billion from the Pentagon’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury Department drug forfeiture program to fund the wall. With the $1.375 billion for fencing along the southern border included in the spending bill he is expected to sign on Friday, that would bring the total for a barrier to $8 billion. [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] Trump is choosing to use his executive authorities because he concluded Congress is “simply incapable” of funding his proposed border barrier, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters on a call Friday morning before the president announced his plan in the Rose Garden. Democrats, however, have simply refused to fund the kind of concrete — and later steel — structure he has talked about since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015. “With the $8 billion, we should have enough money to do what we wanted to do with the $5.7 [billion],” Mulvaney said. He also defended the emergency declaration as Democrats and left-leaning groups already are threatening legal action, noting over the nearly 60 national emergencies declared in the modern era, over 30 remain on the books. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] “It’s not as if he’s waving a magical wand” to tap a special amount of money, Mulvaney said. “The authority … has been on the books since 1976.” Asked from which military construction projects will be tapped, a senior White House official said lower-priority initiatives are being studied — but nothing to hinder “lethality.” Democratic leaders and left-leaning organizations have threatened a court challenge to Trump’s plans. Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Trump and his top aides in recent days had signaled they were searching through the Office of the President’s legal authorities for ways to shift existing funds into the border barrier project. “We have options that most people don’t really understand,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. He also had teased moving monies from “far less important” programs within the federal budget. A senior administration official on Friday said there are no restriction from Congress on the $6.6 billion Trump plans to tap from the Pentagon and Treasury. But in a Thursday statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York were explicit in threatening a legal fight over his emergency declaration. [Trump defends signing national emergency to build border wall] “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities,” the top Democrats said after Pelosi used her weekly press conference to blast Trump for moving toward what she called an “end-run around Congress,” which controls how federal funds are allocated. Left-leaning organizations like Public Citizen said Thursday they intend to sue the president soon after he signs the declaration. Trump’s top spokeswoman, however, brushed off the threat. “We are very prepared, but there shouldn’t be. The president is doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” Sanders told reporters outside her office Thursday. On the Friday call, a second senior official said Democrats are being disingenuous when they claim they held firm and did not help pass a funding measure for Trump’s wall. The official said the administration long ago agreed to the kind of bollard-style fencing already in place in some areas and which the compromise bill would finance.

---split---15.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/border-wall-national-emergency.html---split---Supported by By Simon Romero ALBUQUERQUE — Almost immediately after President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday so he could proceed with his ambition to build a wall along the border with Mexico, some of his opponents announced their next move: We’ll see you in court. Citing a dearth of evidence for a border crisis and fears over what is shaping into a colossal seizure of private property by the federal government, the Texas county of El Paso, together with human rights and pro-democracy groups, said on Friday that they planned to file a lawsuit almost immediately seeking to block the declaration. The groups argue that communities along the border would be harmed, not saved, by the construction of the wall, and that Mr. Trump had no legal basis for declaring an emergency. Theirs would be the first in an array of legal challenges already coalescing in an effort to thwart Mr. Trump’s plan. “There is zero factual support for the existence of a national emergency at the border,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups preparing to challenge Mr. Trump in court. The declaration, Mr. Saenz added, “would be a laughable object of ridicule were it not so dangerous.” [Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.] The brewing legal battles are likely to focus on such issues as the rights of private property owners; tribal sovereignty of Native Americans living along the border; and how far presidential powers extend. Mr. Trump predicted during his declaration of the emergency that he would face legal obstacles. “Sadly we’ll be sued, and sadly it will go through a process, and happily we’ll win,” he said. Courts have been grappling for at least a decade with lawsuits involving the Secure Fence Act of 2006, legislation passed under former President George W. Bush that authorized the construction of about 700 miles of barriers and fencing along the border with Mexico. Dozens of lawsuits filed by property owners challenging that project are still unresolved. The emergency declaration stands in contrast to that previous construction initiative because Congress this week refused in its bipartisan budget deal to allocate the funds needed to build the kind of wall the president wants. With Mr. Trump determined to go forward, these are just some of the legal battles that are expected. If the festering tension in South Texas over the last decade is any indication, some of the most strident opposition to Mr. Trump’s wall is expected to come from owners of land along the border who face seizure of their property by the federal government to build it. Landowners in Texas, largely in the Rio Grande Valley, filed hundreds of lawsuits aiming to block the Bush administration from building fencing along the border. Some property owners opposed the government’s seizure of their land, while others said the compensation offered by federal authorities was too low. Attention may now shift farther west to El Paso. Broad criticism of Mr. Trump in that city, a Democratic bastion in a state otherwise largely dominated by Republicans, emerged in recent days over the president’s widely discredited claim that border fencing had reduced crime there. El Paso County, which encompasses the city of El Paso and is home to about 800,000 people, joined the Border Network for Human Rights; Protect Democracy, a group aiming to curb authoritarian-style politics; and the Niskanen Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in preparing a lawsuit over Mr. Trump’s declaration. Ricardo Samaniego, who heads the governing county court of commissioners, said that Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration “will further damage El Paso County’s reputation and economy, and we are determined to stop this from happening.” Precedent suggests that those living in the path of the planned wall may have a difficult time challenging it in court: Landowners have lost nearly all of the earlier cases aimed at preventing the federal government from seizing their property, though some ended up securing more compensation than initially offered. Democratic leaders in Congress have vowed to overturn the emergency declaration. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a joint statement. California officials announced on Friday that they planned to sue and said they hoped other states would join. “The president is exploiting a serious law,” the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said at a news conference with Gov. Gavin Newsom. “There is no emergency here for the nation.” Mr. Newsom said that California would be affected by construction of a wall more than any other state. “Fortunately Donald Trump is not the last word,” he said. “The courts will be the last word.” Another legal battle already underway involves the sovereignty of Native Americans living along the border. Leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation, whose land in Arizona runs along 75 miles of the border, have already announced opposition to the border wall by taking their fight to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a part of the Organization of American States aimed at preventing rights abuses. Tohono leaders say that a wall infringes on the right to freedom of movement among the tribe’s members, who live on both sides of the border. Verlon M. Jose, vice chairman of the Tohono nation, has said that the Trump administration would have to build the wall “over my dead body.” The Tohono O’odham’s petition at the human rights commission seeks to impede more wall construction. Other tribes along the border, including the Kickapoo in Texas, the Kumeyaay in California and the Cocopah in Arizona, are examining how to proceed after Mr. Trump’s declaration. Still, the Trump administration has been loath to respond to claims of rights abuses, and it has stopped cooperating with United Nations human rights investigators. That could mean that tribes need to rely on the legal system in the United States to resolve differences over the wall. Environmental groups are also mobilizing to fight the wall in court, but recent legal decisions raise doubts about their ability to successfully argue that federal authorities are circumventing environmental laws. The Supreme Court declined in December to hear a challenge by conservation groups to the proposed wall construction in California, leaving in place a ruling by a federal judge in San Diego that allowed construction to proceed. The plaintiffs in that case argued that the wall would violate environmental laws and imperil habitats for some animals. They unsuccessfully challenged a 1996 law that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive other laws in order to build walls or barriers on the border. Even if an environmental challenge might have an uphill climb in the courts, it could have the effect of delaying wall construction in parts of the border, potentially for months or years. “I expect legal challenges to tie this up for a long time,” said Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at Yale Law School. “The president and his people are aware of this, but they may care more about the optics of the wall than what actually happens on the border.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a group that is joining El Paso County in a lawsuit over President Trump’s emergency declaration. The group is Protect Democracy, not Project Democracy. Peter Baker in Washington and Jennifer Medina in Los Angeles contributed reporting.    Advertisement

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) President Donald Trump defended his executive action to access $6.6 billion in Pentagon and Treasury Department funds for his southern border barrier, accusing Democrats of opposing it as part of a “big con” and “a lie.” Trump said Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Charles E. Schumer “know” border walls work, but they are resisting his proposal purely for political reasons. “We fight wars that we should never have been in many cases,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. “But we don’t defend our border. … Walls work 100 percent.” [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] The president revealed his likely legal strategy in defending his move in court, saying he acted for “invasion purposes.” The president did not speak from a teleprompter, and he did not appear to be reading from a binder he carried to his podium. His border and immigration remarks soon resembled a tamer version of one of his campaign rallies. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said. He opened the press conference with rambling statements that touched on everything from China and UK trade talks to the Islamic State to Syria to the state of the economy and the stock market. Once he was back on topic, he called a national emergency “a great thing to do” and again claimed undocumented migrants are carrying out an “invasion” of the United States. “We want to stop gangs” and “drugs from coming into our country,” he said before veering off into attacks on Democrats. He claimed that if Democrats had won the presidency in 2016, the economy would not be “going through the roof.” [Republicans have concerns about Trump’s emergency declaration, too] Trump took a swipe at Democrats, saying “they didn’t even fight us” during a conference committee’s negotiations on matters like bolstering security at ports of entry. He said the other border security funds in the bill he will sign later is “crazy,” adding “I don’t even know what to do with it.” The White House announced Thursday that Trump would sign a seven-agency spending measure that includes $1.375 billion for fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also confirmed the president will tap his executive authorities for billions more. “If we had the wall, it would be very easy,” he said of stopping migrants from reaching American soil. “That’s the story: We want to have a very safe country.” Though Democratic leaders and left-leaning organizations quickly threatened court challenges, Trump said the national emergency he is triggering Friday allows him to shift $3.5 billion from the Defense Department’s military construction fund into the boundary barrier project. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] In a new twist he hinted at all week, Trump is also issuing an executive order to transfer $2.5 billion from the military’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury drug forfeiture program into the border project. Trump said the military would not be impacted because he is taking “a small amount” from its budget that now exceeds $700 billion. Trump said he signed emergency declaration documents Friday because of the “invasion” of undocumented migrants, which he again claimed bring drugs and crime into the country. Democrats and immigration experts say his claims are overblown, however. Trump had created confusion during the presser saying he had signed the order but would sign the final documents after he went back into the Oval Office. At about 2:20 p.m., White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Trump had signed the spending bill. She tweeted a picture at about 11 a.m. depicting Trump signing a document identified as the emergency declaration.

---split---16.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/trump-republican-party.html---split---Supported by By Carl Hulse and Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON — Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, spent the last two weeks hammering out a deal on federal spending and border security with colleagues from both parties, reassured by a sense that Congress was finally asserting itself as a civil, stabilizing force. The feeling did not last. On Friday, President Trump mounted one of the most serious executive branch challenges to congressional authority in decades, circumventing Congress with an emergency declaration. It would allow him to unilaterally divert billions of dollars to a border wall and presented his Republican allies on Capitol Hill, who labored on a legislative compromise, with the excruciating choice of either defending their institution or bowing to his whims. The president’s move left Senate Republicans sharply divided, and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop Mr. Trump or how far into uncharted territory they are willing to follow a headstrong president operating with no road map beyond his own demands. “With him you always have to expect the unexpected,” said Ms. Capito, speaking on the phone from her kitchen in Charleston, W.Va., exhausted from a week of late-night talks at the Capitol. The Republican resistance to Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration was much more pronounced in the Senate than in the House, where a few Republicans — in the minority but more closely aligned to Mr. Trump — groused. But most of the conservative rank and file embraced it. After threatening to kill the spending compromise needed to keep the government open, Mr. Trump opted to cite a national emergency to pry loose additional funding to build a wall longer than the 55 miles in the bipartisan agreement. It was the divisive step that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, Ms. Capito and most other Republicans in the Senate had forcefully urged him not to take, because it would establish a precedent they feared future Democratic presidents would use against them. The decision left Mr. McConnell, a professed guardian of the Senate’s prerogatives and power, joining with Mr. Trump in supporting an executive branch end run greater than any of the incursions into the legislative process he often accused President Obama of pursuing. Fellow senators said Mr. McConnell, a former member of the Appropriations Committee, was unhappy with the declaration but saw it as the only way to pass the spending bill. Some top Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, pivoted quickly to say they supported the president’s action because it was the only option left to him after Congress failed to meet his demands for wall funding. Mr. McConnell has even begun offering the president strategic advice on how best to push his plan, aides said. But Mr. McConnell is also warning Mr. Trump of the damage it could inflict on the party heading into the 2020 elections. Other Republicans portrayed it as a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers, a blatant disregard by the president for Congress’s fundamental role in determining how federal dollars are spent. “He is usurping congressional authority,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee, said in an interview. “If the president can reallocate for his purposes billions of dollars in federal funding that Congress has approved for specific purposes and have been signed into law, that has the potential to render the appropriations process meaningless.” Several other Senate Republicans publicly and privately joined Ms. Collins in describing the move as a flagrant breach of congressional jurisdiction and a dangerous precedent. Their numbers raised the clear possibility that enough Republican defectors could join with Senate Democrats to provide a majority to disapprove of the president’s decision should the opportunity arise. Four Republicans might be enough to join with Senate Democrats and pass legislation rebuking the president, and leadership aides put the number of potential defectors as high as 10. But the unrest seemed well short of the sort of partywide revolt necessary to override a veto by Mr. Trump of any legislative attempt to prevent his declaration of an emergency, leaving a legal challenge as the only recourse. “I would not vote for disapproval,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the Appropriations Committee chairman who led the spending negotiations. “He’s got the power to defend the country, to defend the borders, to protect the people as commander in chief. I believe the courts would uphold him on this.” Despite reservations about many of the actions taken by Mr. Trump and the White House over the past two years, most congressional Republicans have been reluctant to put too much distance between themselves and the president given his grip on Republican voters, many of whom consider the wall a national necessity. Mr. Trump exerts a powerful hold on his party, and lawmakers are cowed by the belief that opposing him will end in their political destruction. Still, the emergency declaration was a direct assault on the ability of lawmakers themselves to restrain the president, and it raised expectations that more could balk at what was widely viewed as a serious case of executive overreach. “Somebody is going to have to say enough is enough,” said Trent Lott, the former Senate leader from Mississippi, who questioned the wisdom of the move. Even those senators who said they were willing to abide by the president’s decision did so grudgingly, acknowledging that it was a bad way to govern and could have significant consequences. “I don’t see anything that necessarily violates the law, but that is a very different question from whether we should be doing it,” said Senator Mike Lee, a conservative Republican of Utah who is known for his view that Congress has handed over too much power to the executive branch. “We have relinquished power voluntarily because we don’t want to make judgment calls that make people angry, so we leave it to the executive,” he said. “It’s almost as if Congress doesn’t want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking.” Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida spoke for many House Republicans in praising the president’s action. “I’m proud of our president for boldly declaring he will not allow politics to stand in the way of the United States’ national security interests,” said Mr. Gaetz, a Trump ally. Democrats were united in their condemnation, accusing Mr. Trump of claiming a false crisis because he could not win over Congress with his argument. They said the president was so desperate to build the wall as a difficult re-election campaign loomed that he was willing to shred the Constitution to do so. “This is not how you use national emergencies,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama. “He is literally creating a constitutional crisis because he has a campaign crisis.” With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress during his first term, Mr. Trump never had to issue a veto. But that streak could be broken with a Democratic-led House joining with Democrats in the Senate and the right number of Republicans to support legislation voicing disapproval of the emergency declaration. Party strategists said a veto could even bolster Mr. Trump by showing his backers that he was willing to take on Congress over his wall and that it was unlikely there would be enough votes to override it. The divide, though, could become a political problem for embattled Republican incumbents up for re-election next year, like Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who will face competing calls back home to break with the president or stick with him. Some Republican senators said they were less concerned about the political implications than the effect on Congress. Members of the Appropriations Committee said that their spending bills had been carefully constructed and that shifting money could stall projects that both they and federal agencies including the Pentagon had deemed necessary. And they fear consolidating too much power in the hands of a president. “It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “This is a fundamental constitutional responsibility of Congress,” said Ms. Collins. “We should be opposing this strongly.” There is a small chance that Mr. Trump will accept a list of existing programs, compiled by Mr. Alexander, that Republicans believe could be used for wall money, rendering the emergency declaration moot. But nobody is holding out much hope that will happen. Ms. Capito said she would spend the holiday weekend weighing what to do next. She encouraged Mr. Trump to do the same. “He’s got to ask himself, ‘What are the ramifications of what I’m doing?’” she said. “If the resolution comes from the House to the Senate, where are those votes going to fall? What does that do to my momentum? He’s got to be considering that, I’m certain. Maybe he’s willing to take whatever could happen, maybe that’s not bothering him.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Trump said he would declare a national emergency to free up federal funding to build a wall along the southern border. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) ANALYSIS — A testy and combative President Donald Trump winged it Friday in the Rose Garden, turning an often-rambling defense of his border security emergency into a 2020 assault on Democrats. Trump has redefined the presidency around his unique style and penchant for unpredictable and unprecedented moves, as well as the sharp rhetoric he uses both at the White House and his rowdy campaign rallies. But there was something different during Trump’s remarks Friday, with the president leading off his remarks by talking about anything but the compromise funding measure and border security actions he signed later that day. He lauded his “very good relationship” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and touted their second denuclearization summit later this month, even talking up that country’s economic potential. On Chinese President Xi Jinping, again, Trump talked about their rosy relationship and predicted: “We’re a lot closer in this country than we ever were with having a real trade deal” with Beijing — yet he struggled to note specific things that might be in the potential deal. Out of the blue, and with no teleprompter loaded with prepared remarks, he announced his administration is planning a trade deal with the United Kingdom that amounts to “increasing very substantially” trade between the longtime allies. Back on Kim, he said: “No more rockets going up, no more missiles going up, no more test of nuclear,” even though his own intelligence chiefs say North Korea has not taken steps to dismantle its nuclear programs. About an hour later came his both-sides-of-the-mouth dismissal of the notion, as NBC News’ Norah O’Donnell asked, that Fox News and conservative personalities are “setting policy.” He also said many conservative television and radio personalities have been “terrific” supporters of both his candidacy and campaign. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] For instance, despite noting that conservative commentator Ann Coulter was among the first to predict his 2016 victory, Trump, as he often does, sent mixed signals: “I like her. But she’s off the reservation,” he said to chuckles from the press corps and his own staff who were assembled on the nearby colonnade. Coulter has publicly criticized Trump in recent months for not building the border wall. Watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge It was a few minutes before a sun-drenched Trump launched into his usual border security and illegal immigration talking points. He at first appeared flat and frustrated. But he eventually hit his stride — and the uniquely unscripted president fell into campaign mode, turning a venue typically reserved for staid and stately events into a rally. And it wasn’t long before he launched a string of attacks on congressional Democrats, including two of his favorite targets who are vastly unpopular with his conservative base. “Nancy knows it. Chuck knows it. They all know it. It’s a big lie. It’s a big con game,” he said of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, contending that large loads of drugs or humans being trafficked only cross the U.S.-Mexico border in “areas where you don’t have a wall.” “You don’t have to be very smart to know, you put up a barrier, people … can’t do anything,” Trump said. He spoke of “monstrous caravans” heading for the U.S.-Mexico border, saying several times he opted to declare a national emergency and issue an executive order to access $6.6 billion in Pentagon and Treasury Department dollars for his border barrier project because “we are talking about an invasion.” (The bipartisan spending measure he signed includes $1.375 billion, taking the total to roughly $8 billion — though court cases are inevitable. One could come from the Democratic leaders he once again slammed.) But the president did not appear eager at times to stick to the day’s purported topic. Soon, he was back to criticizing Beijing’s trade tactics and touting the U.S. economy’s performance since he took office. “We’ve picked up … trillions of dollars of worth,” he asserted. “And China’s lost trillions of dollars.” Then he swerved to a preview of a new round of trade talks with Chinese officials next week in Washington. After briefly getting back on track, Trump opted for another abrupt swipe at Democrats. “If the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes,” he said, then explaining that his economy means “more people want to come.” The implication: He needs his wall to keep more of those additional migrants out, and he’s willing to take on Democrats and outside groups in court to build it. [Legal fight expected for Trump’s national emergency declaration] And once the president took questions, the campaign rally continued as he lashed out at CNN’s Jim Acosta. “You’re CNN. You’re fake news. You have an agenda,” Trump said. “It’s a fake question.” And Playboy’s Brian Karem got what has become a Trump press conference staple when the president ordered him to “sit down.” Above all, Trump’s tone and body language suggested a chief executive who is frustrated after having to take historically extreme measures to merely move a top campaign promise forward. “I got almost $1.4 billion dollars when I wasn’t supposed to even get one dollar,” Trump said, mocking Pelosi’s statement that she would only give him a buck for the barrier in the spending measure both chambers passed with bipartisan tallies Thursday. “But I’m not happy with it.” And he clearly knows court challenges of his pending funding shifts are coming. But again, he seemed less confident than he typically does in public. “Happily, we’ll win,” he said. “I think.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---19.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/trumps-wall-words-will-used---split---Protesters erect a cardboard wall in front of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas in 2016. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) If there were a hall of fame of legal self-owns, there would be a spot of honor for a line Friday from President Donald Trump as he announced that he would declare a national emergency to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. To do so, Trump plans in part to use the National Emergency Act of 1976, but he undercut his argument that it was an emergency at all. “I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said from the Rose Garden, “but I’d rather do it much faster.” The next sound was lawyers across the country frantically adding Trump’s words to lawsuits to stop the president’s action. “Whatever a national emergency may be, that’s not it,” Supreme Court litigator Neal Katyal said. “That quote is going right in the lawsuit.” And there was little doubt about how prominent it should be. “That’s plaintiffs’ Exhibit A,” said Elizabeth Goitein, a national security expert at the Brennan Center. “Consider putting this on page 1,” Supreme Court litigator Deepak Gupta tweeted to any lawyers crafting petitions. “This quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every complaint filed this afternoon,” said conservative appellate lawyer George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. And Omar Jadwat, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has called the emergency declaration an abuse of presidential power, tweeted: “keep talking mr president.” Trump’s statement, directly contrary to his interests, isn’t necessarily a silver bullet for challengers. And it doesn’t mean that the federal courts ultimately will stop Trump from using his powers to shift about $6.7 billion from the Defense and Treasury departments for the project. But it makes life tougher for the Justice Department lawyers who will defend the emergency declaration and ensures that, much like Trump’s travel ban, the president’s words will play a key role in the legal fight over his actions. The ACLU announced Friday that it would file a lawsuit early next week. “By the president’s very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency,” executive director Anthony Romero said. The central question will be whether the national emergency is actually a pretext to get around the Constitution’s requirement that Congress is in charge of appropriations. For lawmakers and other critics already pointing to immigration, crime and drug trafficking statistics to argue there is no emergency on the border, Trump’s line amazed. “Trump’s own admission that this is not a national emergency,” Missouri Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II tweeted in response to the line. “You can't make this stuff up.” “Hint: if you ‘didn't need’ to do it, then it wasn't an emergency, to begin with,” California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill said. Trump also used the Friday announcement to describe what he thought would happen with the legal challenges to the emergency declaration, and it tracks fairly close to what many legal experts predict could happen. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling, and then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully, we’ll get a fair shake, and we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the [travel] ban,” Trump said. Trump’s words about national security were also prominent in the travel ban fight. As a candidate, he had called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” and challengers argued that and other statements showed the ban was actually a pretext for a discriminatory “Muslim ban.” Lower courts stopped the ban. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision in June that split the court along familiar ideological lines, ultimately ruled that Trump had a sufficient national security justification for a policy that on its face “says nothing about religion.” Still, the travel ban case showed that conservative justices are reluctant to second guess a president’s judgment about what is a national emergency and might be even more so when it comes to the wall, since Congress not only gave the president broad authority but still has the ability to take it away. “My initial assessment is that what President Trump announced is legal,” Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said. “Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter. Congress has been ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back.” The setting of Friday’s line matters, too. In the legal battle over the travel ban, the government tried to dismiss the relevance of Trump’s statements because he made them as a candidate, said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. “That won’t be an option here,” Gorod said. Even before Friday’s line, Goitein, of the Brennan Center, made the case that Trump was undercutting his national security claim by waiting more than three weeks since he first publicly spoke about using the process to get funding for a wall. “Of course, Trump’s hesitation also belies his claim that there is an emergency at the border,” Goitein wrote in The Atlantic. “Presidents don’t dawdle in the face of real emergencies.” Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---24.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-will-declare-national-emergency-at-border-but-legal-fight-expected---split---President Donald Trump, here addressing reporters on Jan. 10, will sign a government shutdown-avoiding bill and declare a national emergency at the border to access Pentagon funds for his proposed southern border barrier. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images file photo) President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border to redirect military funds to his border wall project after lawmakers gave him $4.3 billion less than his $5.7 billion ask. But the move is expected to bring court fights that could sink his plan. A House-Senate conference committee could only agree to give the president just shy of $1.4 billion for the barrier project as conferees struck a deal needed to avert another partial government shutdown. The president — who earlier this week said he couldn’t say he was happy about the contents of the compromise — reluctantly agreed to sign it into law after the Senate and House sign off during floor votes Thursday. [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] The White House confirmed Trump would sign the compromise spending measure — and avert another government shutdown after the recent 35-day one left him politically damaged — but then declare a national emergency. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.” Lawmakers in both parties who desperately want to keep the government open breathed a sigh of relief at the former. But Democrats will have to hold their noses as most of them vote for the spending measure, knowing the president will subsequently take an action over which they long have threatened legal action. [Trump’s cryptic ‘funding bill’ tweet momentarily casts doubt over border bill] Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday afternoon she “may” file a legal challenge to Trump’s national emergency declaration, adding that she didn’t support “any president doing an end-run around Congress.” In a statement issued after her press conference, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer were more explicit in threatening a legal fight. “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities,” the duo said. Trump’s top spokeswoman, however, brushed off the threat. “We are very prepared, but there shouldn’t be. The president is doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” Sanders told reporters outside her office Thursday. Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Democratic and Republican lawmakers in recent days, echoed by legal scholars, had already been predicting that a “national emergency” move would be met by swift legal action. Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy organization, said in a statement Thursday that it would sue Trump if he takes that action. “If this invocation of emergency on false pretenses is tolerated, it could justify almost limitless abuses of presidential and military power, including far-reaching clampdowns on civil rights,” the group said. Mark Rom, a Georgetown University professor, said that should the matter get to the U.S. Supreme Court, he wouldn’t expect the justices to “challenge the president’s ability to declare a national emergency.” “Now, on the question of whether the president’s claim that an emergency allows him to move the money around, it’s anyone’s guess just where the court might come down,” Rom said. “My expectation is this will play out like Trump’s initial travel ban: He will keep tinkering and keep tinkering until the courts decide it’s just within legal boundaries.” Trump’s power to declare the emergency stems from the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which “makes no attempt to dictate conditions for when this can be done, according to Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Thus, if Trump wishes to state that the border is in such a state of disarray or exposure that it constitutes a national emergency under the NEA, he is mostly free to do so. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] “Trump presumably would assert that the border wall is a military fortification of sorts, and that it is key to supporting the military role in providing border security. And so the argument would turn on whether one accepts the predicate about the military’s role in the first instance,” Chesney said. “On one hand, it’s obvious that, in some contexts like an armed invasion, border control can be a military matter of the first order,” he said. “On the other hand, that is not the situation we currently face … and not the way we largely have handled the southern border.” Watch: What is a national emergency? How Congress gave the White House broad, far-reaching powers Gordon Adams, who oversaw defense and national security budgeting for the Clinton White House, agreed that Trump has the legal authority to make the declaration. It is not a settled legal matter that four congressional panels — two now controlled by Democrats — would have to sign off on using Pentagon dollars for the Department of Homeland Security border wall program under a national emergency The funds likely would be drawn from the Pentagon’s “military construction,” or MILCON, budget, Adams said. “There are usually $5 billion to $10 billion of unobligated MILCON funds every year, so the money will be there,” he said. “Now, that will mean the secretaries of the [armed] services won’t be able to upgrade barracks or do other projects on bases, but there’s no sign the president gives a damn or would prioritize that over the wall.” [Spending deal would kill Donald Trump’s federal pay freeze] What’s more, the declaration is a signal White House officials have decided they do not need the approval of the congressional committees to shift the funds around. “There’s no actual statutory requirement for that,” Adams said. “A lot of the ways government does business in this town is based on customs. This administration has found every loophole to those customs.” But Democratic leaders are warning their GOP colleagues to oppose the emergency move. “The precedent that the president is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans,” Pelosi said. That’s because a Democratic president could declare, for instance, the gun violence epidemic a national emergency to their chagrin, she noted. Some Republicans also warned of the Pandora’s box Trump may be opening. “If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?” Washington GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers said, noting that she opposes the Trump’s decision. The compromise spending bill’s $1.375 billion border fencing amount led Trump to, after weeks of threatening it, revert to the national emergency option after promising his conservative base for years that he would build a wall — later termed a “barrier” - along the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to slow the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country. [Trump defends signing national emergency to build border wall] “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway,” he told a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday. The next day, he signaled to reporters his administration was working on a way to shift funds around to get more into the border project’s coffers, saying: “I’m thrilled because we’re supplementing things and moving things around and we’re doing things that are fantastic, taking from far less important areas, and the bottom line is we’re building a lot of wall.” The president has repeatedly warned of a “crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border to justify his move, repeating his hard-line rhetoric that the area is a transit route for lethal narcotics, hordes of migrants making illegal crossings, dangerous criminals and human traffickers. On the legal front, any upcoming lawsuits might include congressional Democrats — just one of many potential legal arenas in which they and Trump could tussle over the next two years. Senate Judiciary member Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, predicted “a significant and likely successful challenge in court.” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer signaled a similar sentiment on Jan. 8. [Trump field tests 2020 campaign attack lines amid latest shutdown drama] But as another shutdown neared, many GOP lawmakers who previously had concerns about an emergency declaration changed their tunes. They said the conference committee proposed too little for border barrier dollars, giving Trump no choice but to seek the Pentagon monies. As the expected legal challenges play out, Rom, the Georgetown professor, suggested both sides can claim wins. “[Trump] can declare victory, no matter what happens in the courts. The president can now say to his supporters that he has solved the problem, and that he had no other choice. He can say, ‘I’ve done all I can do,’” Rom said. “Democrats can tell their supporters they stood strong and forced the president’s hand.” But Pelosi indicated Democrats will be methodical, saying of a legal challenge: “First, we have to see what the president says.” To that end, White House aides Thursday afternoon had only begun mulling how Trump might sign the spending measure and the emergency order. In late January, when he announced he would support a stopgap measure to end the partial government shutdown, he took advantage of an unseasonably warm Washington winter day with an early afternoon Rose Garden event.

---split---54.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-special-counsel-robert-mueller-investigation_n_5c5c9891e4b03afe8d65ada3---split---Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is ramping up after a midterm election hiatus — just as Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives. It can all be a lot to keep up with. So here’s your guide to what’s happening with the Mueller probe and what comes next. A decent amount so far, but we don’t yet have the full picture. Much of the media coverage of the Mueller investigation has focused on the Americans in Trump’s orbit who have been caught up in the probe. But most of the individuals indicted in the Mueller probe are Russian nationals accused of involvement in a conspiracy to boost Trump’s 2016 candidacy by hacking the Democratic National Committee or of manipulating social media. One reason those cases don’t get a lot of day-to-day coverage is that there’s little to no chance that any of those Russians will ever step foot in an American courtroom. Another is that they’re faceless foreign figures, as opposed to boldface-name Americans with direct connections to Trump and his campaign. But those indictments — one announced in February 2018 and one in July 2018 — are essential parts of the Mueller probe. The first indictment accuses 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities of interfering with the 2016 election. The indictment alleges that the defendants posed as Americans and sought to “sow discord in the U.S. political system” and support the Trump campaign, as well as damage Hillary Clinton. The second indictment alleges that 12 Russian nationals ― most of them military intelligence officers ― “conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election” by hacking the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Using the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the Russians released the stolen emails and documents to the public. Former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign deputy Richard Gates, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump associate Roger Stone. There were also cases that grew out of the Mueller probe but don’t really have any direct connection to Trump. There was Richard Pinedo (a California man who sold Russians their fake online identities), London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan (who worked with Manafort) and Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian Manafort associate charged with witness tampering alongside Manafort). Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison in October, van der Zwaan served 30 days before being deported, and Kilimnik (a Russian citizen believed to be living in Russia) isn’t likely to appear in an American court anytime soon. The special counsel has so far secured eight convictions or guilty pleas and issued over 20 indictments. The big names to go down are Manafort, Cohen and Flynn, the lesser-known ones are Papadopoulos and Gates. Manafort was found guilty on several bank fraud charges. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 and admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador. Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about his communications with a professor who told him about Russian “dirt” on Clinton and was sentenced to 14 days. Gates admitted to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and testified against Manafort during his trial. Papadopoulos and van der Zwaan have done their time, and Pinedo is still serving his six-month prison sentence. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a variety of crimes, including campaign finance violations related to paying women hush money to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Most others are awaiting sentencing. Manafort is almost certainly going to prison, potentially for a very long time. After he was found guilty on bank fraud charges last August, Manafort reached a plea deal in which he admitted to conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. But Mueller’s team later accused Manafort of repeatedly lying to investigators during his interviews ― committing even more crimes and breaking his plea deal. A judge ruled in February that Manafort had indeed nullified his agreement with the Mueller investigation and made intentionally false statements to the FBI. Mueller was named as special counsel in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ― who was functioning as attorney general on Russia-related matters at the time because then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from them ― named Mueller as special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. First, there’s the question of whether the Mueller report, as it’s generally understood, will come out at all. William Barr, the once and likely future attorney general, suggested at his confirmation hearing that he believes the report would be kept confidential. But he said that the attorney general could author a separate report that would be publicly disclosed. It’s unclear what form that would take. It’s a pretty tight ship. There haven’t been many leaks coming out of the Mueller investigation, which tends to speak only through court filings. What other news emerges comes from the attorneys representing defendants or targets (and sometimes from the defendants themselves). By getting out ahead of the report and undermining the Mueller investigation, basically. Trump, his supporters and his legal team have already done a lot of work to shake public confidence in the Mueller investigation. By early 2018, Trump had already convinced his voters he was being persecuted by the FBI, with 74 percent of Trump supporters saying the bureau was biased against the president. Some messages by individual bureau employees, of course, helped fuel the perception that the FBI ― generally a conservative-leaning law enforcement organization ― was a hotbed of the liberal resistance. Although the bureau’s public actions ahead of the 2016 election undoubtedly hurt Clinton’s candidacy, a number of officials in FBI leadership exchanged private messages discussing their concerns about Trump before and after his election. No. There have been some clear signs that Mueller’s team has been preparing for a world in which the special counsel investigation no longer exists. Cases that originated with the probe have been passed on to federal prosecutors in U.S. Attorney’s offices, and two federal prosecutors who aren’t on Mueller’s squad are a part of the case against Roger Stone. The offices are typically headed by Trump appointees, but it’s a bit more difficult for the White House to interfere with an ongoing prosecution out of U.S. Attorney’s office without setting off a bunch of alarms. One of the biggest threats to Trump and his associates might come from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. That’s where Trump fixer Michael Cohen was first indicted. In December, SDNY prosecutors announced they secured a nonprosecution agreement with the National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., in which the company admitted it paid former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 to suppress her story about an alleged affair with Trump, a decision that AMI said it made in direct consultation with Trump’s team. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently sought interviews with officials at the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg, who was the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, was granted immunity and has been cooperating with prosecutors since August. Right. The Enquirer published Bezos’ intimate texts with his girlfriend. When Bezos — the CEO of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post — began investigating how the National Enquirer obtained those texts, AMI tried to broker a deal in which it wouldn’t publish intimate photos of Bezos if he agreed to end his investigation. There’s a question whether what he calls “extortion and blackmail” violates AMI’s nonprosecution agreement, which could be, let’s say, a complexifier. It’s a complicated one. Rosenstein is a lifelong Republican who had gained bipartisan respect during his long career as a federal prosecutor when Trump appointed him to the critical No. 2 position at the Justice Department. A few months later, he wrote the memo that provided the legal basis for Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey ― based on the premise that Comey mistreated Clinton. Trump quickly blew up that premise by telling NBC he had “the Russia thing” in mind when he decided to fire Comey. Rosenstein reportedly told other law enforcement officials that he felt used by White House, though he has stuck by the memo in public. Rosenstein soon appointed Mueller as special counsel and later came under attack from Republicans, who went so far as to draft articles of impeachment against him. He’s reportedly planning to exit after Barr is confirmed. Whitaker’s long stint as acting attorney general is unprecedented; the last person to serve as acting attorney general who wasn’t previously confirmed by the Senate was in the position for only six days in the 1860s, before the Department of Justice even existed. Before Whitaker, formerly one of George W. Bush’s U.S. Attorneys, came on board the Trump administration as Sessions’ chief of staff, he worked for a dark-money conservative group that targeted Democrats with ethics complaints, and he was on the board of a shady company now under FBI investigation. Whitaker made a number of comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the DOJ, and Whitaker and Trump apparently hit it off before Trump elevated him to the position of acting attorney general, although Whitaker insisted he made no promises to Trump about how he would handle the probe. A key focus of the Mueller investigation concerns whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks had obtained Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s stolen emails and planned to publish them. The emails were sent to WikiLeaks from Russian hackers, and the emails’ release in October 2016 damaged the Clinton campaign just weeks before the election. Some of the special counsel’s indictments have suggested that there were Trump campaign officials trying to get information about the Podesta emails and speaking with people who would act as intermediaries with WikiLeaks. The most prominent suspect for that is Trump’s longtime informal adviser Roger Stone. Mueller’s team believes that Stone lied to lawmakers about his connections with WikiLeaks and indicted him in late January. FBI agents arrested Stone, and the special counsel’s office charged him on seven counts, including making false statements, obstructing official proceedings and witness tampering. The indictment states that Stone told radio host Randy Credico to lie to a grand jury — referring to a scene in “The Godfather: Part II” in which a character pretends to have no knowledge of crimes he was connected to — and threatened Credico’s dog. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges. There’s also Jerome Corsi, the conspiracy theorist who was in plea negotiations with Mueller’s team. Corsi is a prominent booster of the racist “birther” movement and a former Infowars bureau chief. He cooperated with the investigation until he said in November that their negotiations broke down and that he expected to be indicted. Draft court documents from the special counsel allege that Corsi tipped off Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release material that would hurt the Clinton campaign, multiple outlets reported late last year. Trump’s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer was a central character in the Mueller probe this past year. After FBI raids of his office and hotel room in April 2018, Cohen became a cooperating witness for the special counsel and received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress. His indictment and testimony revealed the apparent inner workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization’s failed plans to build a Moscow Trump Tower, including that Cohen lied to Congress about how long negotiations for the Russian real estate development lasted. Cohen told investigators that at Trump’s direction, he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged sexual affair with Trump. He additionally admitted to helping pay off Karen McDougal to keep her alleged affair with Trump from going public. Trump has denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments. It never got built, and the plan was abandoned in 2016. But as Cohen’s testimony and internal Trump Organization documents detail, negotiations for the project went on far longer than the president admitted and were much more intensive. Documents acquired by BuzzFeed show that Cohen and other Trump Organization officials were still trying to make the deal happen while Trump was attending campaign rallies and denying any connections to Russia. This one is complicated. There was a secretive fight over whether the Supreme Court should get involved in a legal battle that involves a foreign-owned business ― called “Corporation” from “Country A” in court filings ― trying to avoid a subpoena that may have come from Mueller. The Supreme Court decided in January that it will leave a lower court ruling in place, which means the “Corporation” has to comply with the subpoena, but didn’t explain its decision. All this mystery could amount to nothing ― it’s not clear whether the subpoena came from Mueller’s team ― but it has sparked a lot of legal, political and media speculation. It does mean that they have subpoena power, which would allow Democrats to call people to testify or to secure documents of interest related to the Mueller probe. This would also potentially help bring the Mueller investigation findings into the public eye if the White House or new attorney general attempts to suppress the report. Donald Trump Jr. isn’t currently facing any charges, so at least in the short term, the answer is no. But ever since the special counsel indicted Cohen for lying to Congress, there has been an increased focus on whether Trump Jr. could face similar charges. Trump Jr. told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that he never directly or indirectly sought foreign assistance for his dad’s campaign. However, Trump Jr. did hold a meeting in 2016 with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leaders, as well as an Israeli social media specialist, who reportedly all offered to help with Trump Sr.’s campaign. There is also the possibility Trump Jr. could be involved in collusion. He held a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, an intermediary emailed Trump Jr. to let him know that a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Clinton. Trump Jr. responded, “If it’s what you say I love it.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.
