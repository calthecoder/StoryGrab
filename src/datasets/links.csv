---split---2.0---split---http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190212-come-from-away-why-we-need-the-911-musical---split---As the Broadway hit opens in London, Rebecca Laurence recalls the real story of those stranded in Canada on 11 September 2001. Do you remember where you were on 11 September 2001? Chances are that if you were alive and old enough to recall it, you will. Like thousands of others, I was mid-air, crossing the Atlantic bound for North America. My dad and I were headed from the UK to my grandfather’s funeral in Florida (or so we thought). But following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that morning, US airspace was shut; every plane in the air had to be diverted and grounded immediately, including ours. Hundreds of aircraft carrying thousands of bewildered passengers landed on the easternmost edges of the continent, with scarce advance warning. The people on the ground frantically tried to figure out what to do with us. More like this: – The Welsh reporter who exposed Stalin – The most important man in 200 years – Why the Danish love Rita The tragic events of 11 September and the chaos that followed may seem the unlikeliest of subjects for feel-good entertainment. But, Come From Away, dubbed ‘the 9/11 musical’, is the surprise Broadway hit – now open in London – that’s found a way. It’s the brainchild of husband-and-wife-team David Hein and Irene Sankoff, Canadian musical-theatre-makers who were living in New York City in 2001. With a rousing live folk band and foot-stamping songs – Come From Away focuses on the quiet heroism and kindness of the inhabitants of one tiny town in Canada. The population of Gander, Newfoundland, which was around 9,000 in 2001, nearly doubled as an estimated 38 airplanes holding over 6,500 people landed. Its huge airport – as a major refuelling stop – was once the largest in the world, but the town had just 500 hotel rooms.   The musical began to take shape after Irene and David spent several weeks in Gander in 2011, attending a 10-year reunion of the ‘come from aways’ (also known as the ‘plane people’ in local parlance). They were inspired by the stories of hospitality they heard and the deep bonds that had been formed in those few days. They conducted hundreds of hours’ worth of interviews with Gander natives and their visitors before condensing these conversations into a 100-minute play with just 12 actors. We often call it a ‘9/12’ story – David Hein “Everyone on stage is to some degree a composite of multiple people,” David Hein tells BBC Culture. “In that way we wanted to represent everyone who had either helped people or were being helped on that day. “We weren’t trying to write a 9/11 story,” he continues. “We often call it a ‘9/12’ story. We wanted to tell the story of what happened in Newfoundland. It’s not about the tragedy; it’s about how this small community responded to the tragedy.” Both the drama and the humour in Come From Away are borne out of these unique circumstances: the desperate ‘plane people’ trapped on board for up to 30 hours with no connection to the outside world; the locals who scrambled to clothe and feed the thousands, who came from 95 countries. A couple, Nick and Diane, meet and fall in love; another separates. Beverley Bass, American Airlines’ first female captain, is a central figure, as is Bonnie Harris, the animal carer who took charge of a menagerie of 19 – including a pregnant Bonobo chimpanzee. It’s all suffused with Gander’s gentle idiosyncrasies and unique customs, Irish/Newfoundlander dialect and an eccentric ‘screech’ indoctrination ceremony (spoiler: it involves kissing a cod).   Amid the jollity and musical numbers there are sudden touches of pathos: a mother learns her NYC firefighter son is lost; an Egyptian Muslim chef wants to help cook but is treated with suspicion; the moment the ‘plane people’ – trapped on board for 15, 20, 30 hours before disembarking – first see the images of the World Trade Center attacks. Kindness and catharsis Not far beyond Newfoundland is Halifax, Nova Scotia, where our plane and dozens of others landed. Housed four to a room in a naval base, we were fed in the canteen and slept on mattresses on the floor for several days while airspace was closed. Having missed my grandfather’s funeral and with nothing to do, we whiled away the hours by chatting with our roommates, a retired English couple and other fellow plane people; going on a whale-watching tour – anything to distract us from those searing images that played over and over on the television. Considering the sadness and sensitivity around 9/11, even several years later, were Irene and David concerned with how people would respond to the play? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended a performance and invited Ivanka Trump “I frankly never thought that the show would make it to the US because of the material,” Irene confesses. “We were definitely worried. I remember the first audience in the States, just sinking in my seat, thinking, ‘whose idea was this?’” But they needn’t have worried – the response to Come From Away has been wholly positive, even jubilant. In 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended a performance on Broadway and invited Ivanka Trump to watch it with him. The play was nominated for seven Tonys and a Grammy; it has had a run in Dublin, Ireland, and in addition to opening in London, is touring North America, and opens in Melbourne, Australia later this year. At the performance I attended in London earlier this month, it got a standing ovation.   And although people may come to the ‘9/11 musical’ expecting to shed a few tears, David suggests that when they do it’s not always for the reasons they might expect. “These days we’re so used to our news feeds being filled with divisive anger and fearmongering, things that make us turn into an ‘us and them society,’” he says. “To see something where people were able to come together despite their differences and to remember that in times of crisis that’s what we do, that’s what we can do, I think that’s why people cry” he says. “It reminds us that we can be good.” And as another ‘come from away’ – albeit one who remembers being welcomed and cared for in a different Canadian town – I can attest that not only is the play true, it’s irresistible. Irene and David like to quote the Mayor of Gander, Claude Elliott, who didn’t go home for five days after 9/11. “We started off with 7000 strangers,” he said, “but we finished with 7000 family members.” Ultimately it’s this warmth and humanity to which audiences respond. “Almost without thinking about it they welcomed people into the towns,” David says. “It’s such an important thing for people to hear right now.” Come From Away opens in London on 18 February, is touring North America and opens in Melbourne, Australia in July 2019.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47248644---split---Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Trade talks between the US and China have broken up without a deal, with the US warning that "very difficult issues" remain unresolved. The talks in China this week were aimed at securing a new deal before further US tariffs are imposed on 1 March. China said negotiations would now continue in the US next week. "We feel that we have to make headway on some very, very important and very difficult issues," said top US trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer. However, he said he was "hopeful" of progress. President Xi Jinping said he hoped talks next week would "continue to work hard to promote a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement." The two countries have been locked in an escalating trade war, imposing duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. In December, both countries agreed to halt new tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. The US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% if the two sides do not strike a deal by 1 March. But President Trump recently hinted that this deadline could be extended if they are making good progress in negotiations with China. By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent It's a relatively optimistic tone from officials on both sides and at very senior levels too: President Xi himself for China and two US Cabinet level figures, in the shape of the Treasury Secretary and the US Trade Representative. Talks to continue in Washington next week. So is (trade) peace imminent? That would be a rash assumption to make. We have had warm words before and the big ask from the US side is difficult for China. The next stage in China's economic development really does need technology and they will not easily agree to give up the practice of expecting foreign investors to share theirs. That said, a willingness to continue talking as soon as next week, does suggest some reason for hope. Washington is pressing Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies and other support. The US has also accused the government of supporting technology theft as part of its broader development strategy. It wants to bring down its large trade deficit with the Asian powerhouse and wants China to buy more US goods. China has proposed to increase purchases of US goods, such as semiconductors and soybeans, but is unlikely to let up on its economic development model, according to media reports. There is also a sense among some in China that the US is using the trade war to contain its rise, as the two superpowers jostle for global leadership. Countries elsewhere have also become wary of China's rise. Several governments have blocked telecoms companies from using equipment made by Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant, in next-generation 5G mobile networks due to security concerns. The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of Chinese products - which would see virtually all of Chinese imports into the US become subject to these tariffs. The US president confirms he will use emergency powers to build a wall on Mexico's border. 15 sayings from around the world

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/green-beret-charged-murder-says-he-killed-afghan-man-book-n972071---split---A Green Beret accused of murdering an unarmed Afghan man described new details about why he set up an ambush that led to his fatally shooting the alleged Taliban bombmaker and offered other new details about developments that led to the charge he now faces. Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, speaking to "NBC Nightly News" anchor Lester Holt in an interview set to air Friday night, said U.S. forces found the man with bomb components after two Marines were killed in Marjah, Afghanistan, in 2010. The man was taken into custody, but Golsteyn said he later directed his release. Watch this story tonight on “NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt" at 6:30 p.m. ET / 5:30 p.m. CT. After releasing the man, Golsteyn told Holt: "I set an ambush." "You've had a lot of time to play this over in your mind. Is there anything that you regret, any decision that you wish you had not made?" Holt asked. "Not at all," Golsteyn said. The Army alleges that Golsteyn murdered the suspected bomb maker when he was deployed in Helmand Province in 2010. Golsteyn first admitted to killing the Afghan man during a CIA job interview in 2011. The Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) launched an investigation into the killing, but did not charge him due to a lack of physical evidence, according to army officials. Instead, Golsteyn was issued a formal letter of reprimand and stripped of his Silver Star, the military's third highest award for valor, and Special Forces patch. In 2016, Golsteyn appeared on FOX News and admitted to killing the Afghan man. The interview brought new attention to the case. Golsteyn was charged with premeditated murder in December. President Donald Trump at the time tweeted that he would review the case, referring to Golsteyn as a "U.S. military hero." In his interview with Holt, Golsteyn said he hasn't heard from Trump but was heartened by his comment. While he and his wife, Julie, would welcome a pardon, he said he's not holding out for one. "It would be amazing," Golsteyn said. "We would welcome it. It would put finality to this for us. But we are preparing to take the Army head on." Golsteyn said there was no doubt in his mind the Afghan man was a bomb maker and setting an ambush to engage him if he returned to join the Taliban fighters was in line with the rules of engagement on the battlefield. The charges made against him by Army investigators could be applied to many other U.S. troops, he said, given the actions he took. "What they have endeavored to do is to describe what I would say is a fairly routine combat action as murder," Golsteyn said. "Anyone who's participated in the global war on terror over the last 15 years is likely subject to be accused of murder under this rubric." The fighting in Marjah in early 2010 was so fierce that civilians had largely vacated the area, Golsteyn said. He described the Afghan man as a bomb maker "going back to his combat unit" and "a member of a declared hostile force." He said he staged the ambush only to intercept the Afghan man if he walked in the direction toward a base of Taliban fighters, not if he'd walked in a different direction. "He could've gone any direction in Marjah. And if he went back to rejoin his unit that's when he met me in an ambush. Had he gone any other direction we don't meet," Golsteyn said. He declined to say whether he conducted the ambush alone. He said he believes the Afghan man saw him, but that the two did not exchange any words. No one ordered him to do it, he said, because he had the authority to stage the ambush and his actions were consistent with the rules of engagement. "Our standing rules of engagement, not just say I can make that engagement," he said, "they order me to make that engagement." His immediate commander, he said, has testified "that had I not made that decision he would've fired me." NBC News was not present at the board of inquiry when Golsteyn's commander allegedly made the comment and could not confirm. After the ambush Golsteyn said he went back to his base. He wouldn't discuss his disposal of the body, which was burned. He did say burning bodies was not uncommon given the area was clear of civilians who would claim them, and there were concerns about battlefield hygiene and the Taliban booby trapping them with explosives. Golsteyn said he didn't tell anyone back at the base at the time, not because he was trying to conceal his actions, but because it was something that didn't stand out as extraordinary given the battles American forces were in on a daily basis. He said it was not unusual for U.S. troops to set ambushes and described the incident as "not an extraordinary moment in a situation where every day was extraordinary." "We were in combat from sun up to sun down," he said. "We were in these types of engagements all day. Sometimes with just a smoke or with people. We didn't come back and go, "Hey, I was out there and got shot at today or shot the — …That wasn't the thing of what we talked about." A spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, noted that Golsteyn has waived his right to a preliminary hearing in military court. "Since recalled to active duty, Maj. Golsteyn has been afforded the respect his rank commands and received the same privileges as all soldiers assigned to United States Army Special Operations Command," Bymer added. "The date of next step in MAJ Golsteyn's case is undetermined at this time. As an active law enforcement matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the case." The case has taken a toll on Golsteyn and his wife, Julie. Julie Golsteyn said it has so affected her views of the Army that she would not allow her infant son serving in the military. "Would you wanna see your son join the military?" "I would be open to it," Golsteyn said. But his wife quickly chimed in: "Absolutely not." "Over my dead body," she said, "which makes me very sad and that breaks my heart to say." Carol E. Lee is a national political reporter for NBC News.

Please read the rules before joining the discussion. Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid and the NFL agreed to settle on Friday, but the case won’t truly be resolved until Kaepernick is back on the field. USA TODAY Sports Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid have settled their respective collusion grievances against the NFL. Attorney Mark Geragos, who has represented the two players in the matter, and the NFL each confirmed the confidential agreement in a joint statement Friday afternoon. "For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL," Geragos and the NFL said in the statement. "As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party." Financial terms of the settlements were not disclosed. Yahoo! Sports reported a final hearing on the collusion grievances had been scheduled for this month. pic.twitter.com/5sdcGSuwvW The NFL Players Association said in a statement that it is not aware of the details of the settlements but supported the players' decision. "We continuously supported Colin and Eric from the start of their protests, participated with their lawyers throughout their legal proceedings and were prepared to participate in the upcoming trial in pursuit of both truth and justice for what believe the NFL and its clubs did to them," the union said in the statement. "We are glad that Eric has earned a job and a new contract and we continue to hope that Colin gets his opportunity as well." Kaepernick, who was the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem as a means of protesting police brutality and racial inequality, filed his grievance against the NFL in October 2017 under the league's collective bargaining agreement. Reid, Kaepernick's former teammate, filed a similar grievance in May. Opinion: Colin Kaepernick proves to be a winner again in settlement with NFL The players alleged that NFL owners had colluded to keep them out of the league because of their protests, which sent ripples across the league during the 2016 and 2017 seasons — particularly after President Donald Trump used an expletive at a rally to describe protesting players, and blasted the NFL for allowing the protests in the first place. A decision on the case was initially expected in the first half of 2019, but a settlement looked to be the eventual outcome after a decision handed down August. That’s when Stephen Burbank, the arbitrator who handled the case, denied the NFL’s motion for a summary judgment, a maneuver – if granted – would have dismissed the case. Burbank had much of the evidence in the case at that point, which included numerous depositions. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, NFL Executive Vice President Troy Vincent and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones were among those deposed in the case. Geragos even attempted to depose Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, USA TODAY Sports reported in June. Kaepernick remains a free agent, while Reid has since returned to the NFL. He joined the Carolina Panthers midway through last season and recently signed a three-year deal with the team worth $22 million. "If anything, it proves my point from last year," Reid said of his new contract. "I didn't sign until the (fourth) week and did for almost the league minimum. And this year I signed a more substantial contract. And nothing has changed. I'm still the same player." Contributing: A.J. Perez Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/beto-orourke-take-wall-el-paso-mexico---split---Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, said that if it were up to him, he would tear down the border fence separating his hometown of El Paso, Texas, from Mexico. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Potential 2020 presidential candidate and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke said Thursday that if it were up to him, the border barrier separating his old El Paso, Texas, district from Mexico would come down. “Yes, absolutely. I’d take the wall down,” the Texas Democrats said in an interview on MSNBC, on the American side of the border wall with a view into Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. In his State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump touted the border barrier in El Paso for making the city safer. “Walls work,” the president claimed, invoking El Paso, though he did not cite any statistics to support his theory that the barrier in El Paso had an impact on crime rates. Crime rates in El Paso since 1985 have been well below the national average for large American cities, FBI statistics show. The violent crime rate in the Texas border city has been steadily decreasing since the early 1990s, with no discernible difference in the rate dropping since the 57-mile border fence went up in 2008. In fact, violent crime slightly increased between 2007 and 2010 but has mostly been on the decline since, statistics show. Watch: Trump and Beto O’Rourke strike contrasting messages in dueling Texas rallies O’Rourke said that crossings at the southern border with Mexico become a hot political issue for the wrong reasons when people feel national and homeland security threats. Since the 9/11 attacks, politicians have fanned those fears with measures to turbocharge border security, O’Rourke suggested. “We do this, whether it is the war on terror, the war on drugs — we project our fears and anxieties to places like El Paso, to the U.S.-Mexico border, and punish the people who live here,” O’Rourke said. “There’s no reason to do that. But it is the fear and the anxiety that is stoked by people who should and frankly do know better that results in these policies,” he said. O’Rourke has not announced whether he will run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. He lost his challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms by 3 points.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends January 30, 2019 By Anthony Cilluffo and Richard Fry The 2020 U.S. presidential election is rapidly coming into view – and so is the electorate that will determine its outcome. While demographic changes unfold slowly, it’s already clear that the 2020 electorate will be unique in several ways. Nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters – their largest share ever – driven by long-term increases among certain groups, especially Hispanics. At the same time, one-in-ten eligible voters will be members of Generation Z, the Americans who will be between the ages 18 and 23 next year. That will occur as Millennials and all other older generations account for a smaller share of eligible voters than they did in 2016.  Pew Research Center defines the electorate as all citizens ages 18 and older living in the United States. We don’t account for those who have lost their voting rights, such as people convicted of felonies living in certain states, or those who can vote from outside the U.S., such as citizens living abroad and members of the armed forces stationed in other countries.  What might these demographic shifts mean politically? In 2016, nonwhite voters were more likely to back Democrat Hillary Clinton, while white voters were more likely to back Republican Donald Trump. Younger generations, meanwhile, differ notably from older generations in their views on key social and political issues. It remains unclear how these patterns might factor into the 2020 election and, as always, a great deal will depend on who turns out to vote. We project that the 2020 election will mark the first time that Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13% of eligible voters – slightly more than blacks. This change reflects the gradual but continuous growth in the Hispanic share of eligible voters, up from 9% in the 2008 presidential election and 7% in the 2000 election. The black eligible voter population has grown about as fast as the electorate overall, meaning their share has held constant at about 12% since 2000. In raw numbers, a projected 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, compared with 30 million blacks. The population of Asians eligible to vote will reach an estimated 11 million in 2020, which is more than double the 5 million who were eligible to vote in 2000, accounting for 5% of next year’s electorate. Taken together, this strong growth among minority populations means that a third of eligible voters will be nonwhite in 2020, up from about a quarter in 2000. This increase is at least partially linked to immigration and naturalization patterns: One-in-ten eligible voters in the 2020 election will have been born outside the U.S., the highest share since at least 1970. Voter turnout will play an important role in determining the relative electoral influence of different racial and ethnic groups. For example, while Hispanics will outnumber blacks among eligible voters next year, they may not actually cast more ballots than blacks due to different turnout patterns. In recent presidential elections, blacks were substantially more likely than Hispanics to vote. Indeed, the number of Hispanic eligible voters who didn’t vote has exceeded the number of those who did vote in every presidential election since 1996.  Still, the changing racial and ethnic composition of the electorate likely has political implications in part because nonwhites have long been significantly more likely than whites to back Democratic candidates. For instance, in the 2016 election, white voters favored Donald Trump by a 15 percentage point margin, while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton. Another important long-term trend is the overall aging of the electorate. In 2020, nearly a quarter of the electorate (23%) will be ages 65 and older, the highest such share since at least 1970. This reflects not only the maturation of the large Baby Boom generation but also increased life expectancy among older Americans. Baby Boomers and older generations, who will be ages 56 and older next year, are expected to account for fewer than four-in-ten eligible voters in 2020. This is a significant change from 2000, when nearly seven-in-ten eligible voters (68%) were Boomers, Silents or members of the Greatest Generation (collectively, those ages 36 and older at the time). Even as recently as 2012, when the youngest Boomer was 48 years old, Boomer and older generations were about half of the electorate (49%). The next presidential election will also mark the first time that Millennials (who will be ages 24 to 39 in 2020) will account for a slightly smaller share of the electorate than they represented in the last presidential election. The raw number of Millennials eligible to vote is increasing due to foreign-born Millennials naturalizing to become citizens. But the Millennial share of the electorate has peaked as they are not growing as fast as the electorate overall. Meanwhile, the leading edge of Generation Z (people ages 18 to 23 in 2020) is projected to comprise one-in-ten eligible voters, up from just 4% in 2016, when the vast majority were too young to cast ballots. These post-Millennials are on track to be more racially and ethnically diverse than their predecessors: In 2020, Gen Z eligible voters are expected to be 55% white and 45% nonwhite, including 21% Hispanic, 14% black, and 4% Asian or Pacific Islander. By comparison, the Boomer and older electorate is projected to be about three-quarters white (74%).  Differences in turnout rates again matter when talking about generations and should be kept in mind as election season gets underway. Since older adults are more likely to turn out to vote, it’s possible that older generations will form a larger share of actual voters in 2020 than their share in the electorate. That’s what happened in 2016: Even though Boomers and older generations accounted for 43% of eligible voters, they cast 49% of the ballots.

The most egregious anti-democratic actions ever taken by the what can now fairly be called the Deep State are confirmed with the publication of fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s new book.

It’s fitting that William Barr’s confirmation as attorney general happened just as two powerful law-enforcement figures were trading accusations involving President Trump. Mr. Barr’s greatest challenge isn’t antitrust deals, immigration policy or even handling special counsel Robert Mueller. Disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has now admitted in his new book that he ordered obstruction of justice and counterintelligence investigations of President Trump in retaliation for Trump’s firing of FBI Director and McCabe friend James Comey. Andrew McCabe, you see, has reminded us once again that there really is a powerful deep state, and that there has not been a full accounting of rampant FBI misconduct during the presidential campaign of 2016.

Hannah Gaber Saletan, USA TODAY WASHINGTON – White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed on Friday that she has been interviewed by investigators working for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “The President urged me, like he has everyone in the administration, to fully cooperate with the special counsel,” Sanders said in a statement. “I was happy to voluntarily sit down with them.” Sanders wouldn't discuss the topic or the timing of the interview. Investigators working for Mueller have interviewed a series of people linked to Trump in recent months, including former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.

As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback. — USA TODAY Opinion editors By Walt Heyer "Had I not been misled by media stories of sex change 'success' and by medical practitioners who said transitioning was the answer to my problems, I wouldn't have suffered as I have. Genetics can't be changed. Feelings, however, can and do change. Underlying issues often drive the desire to escape one's life into another, and they need to be addressed before taking the radical step of transition." By Michael J. Stern "Here's the thing about what is taboo to any minority community. The minorities are the ones who have been discriminated against. They get to choose what offends them. With that said, we must recognize that dressing in blackface as a way of dehumanizing the black community is different than trying to physically resemble an admired black person at a Halloween party. Intent is everything." Green New Deal (Photo11: Nate Beeler/The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch/PoliticalCartoons.com) By Kurt Bardella "Now that Republicans have lost the power of the majority, an investigative avalanche is about to engulf the Trump presidency. Congressional Democrats wisely spent their first month in the majority laying the groundwork to launch a series of important investigations. They organized their committees, added members, updated their committee rules, hired investigative staff, and are now operating at full capacity." By Ryan Bourne "It is hard to make a good faith critique of this plan, because it features a nearly complete denial of trade-offs or costs. This is surprising given that Ocasio-Cortez herself has a degree in economics, for which the study of trade-offs is the basis." By Victorina Morales "Once Mr. Trump's presidential campaign began, life at the club changed. I guess they were more concerned about our status, so my supervisor asked for a good set of papers in order to continue working there. When I reminded him that I was undocumented, he simply provided me with the documentation necessary to continue working. In fact, he had someone take my photograph in the laundry room of the club to use for the new identification card and lent me money to purchase new papers."

Please read the rules before joining the discussion. America’s Founders were not big on executive power. Even after a war with Britain, the Constitution’s authors saw no reason for a strong presidency. Many of the powers they assigned to presidents, including staffing their own administrations, were contingent on congressional approval. The authority of presidents to act unilaterally included vetoing legislation, granting pardons and not much else. But over the years, congresses and courts concluded that a more powerful and flexible president was needed. They indulged presidents’ sweeping claims of authority. They also enacted laws that allowed presidents to act without congressional approval and in ways not outlined in the Constitution. Notable among these is the 1976 National Emergencies Act, a law that codifies presidents’ power to declare an emergency. This act, as well as narrower provisions in other laws, presumes that presidents would exercise these powers with great restraint and only in real emergencies, not to make good on campaign promises or mollify activists within their party. The White House on Jan. 13, 2019, during the government shutdown. (Photo11: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) REP. HICE: President was forced into declaring a national emergency Clearly that is not the case with the White House announcement Thursday that President Donald Trump would sign a bipartisan spending compromise to prevent another government shutdown but would also move more money into his border wall project (the one Mexico was supposed to pay for) by declaring a national emergency. The most obvious consequence of this destructive executive overreach is the precedent it would set for future Democratic presidents. It’s not hard to imagine them declaring emergencies to address gun violence, immigration, climate change, medical costs and other causes of interest to the left — and Republicans howling about an imperial presidency. Assuming that Congress is unable or unwilling to overrule Trump’s emergency declaration, it will almost certainly be challenged in court. That would mean a ruling on whether the situation at the border really is a national emergency. In all likelihood, the answer would be no. Illegal immigration and the influx of Central American asylum seekers are significant ongoing problems, not national crises like Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks. The legal challenge would also invite the courts to consider the broader question of whether Congress even has the right to cede its constitutionally derived powers, including the power of the purse, to the president. Trump is acting unilaterally because Congress wouldn’t give him more than $1.4 billion for border barriers. All of this should prompt Republicans to ask: Is the extra wall money worth trampling on the Constitution, stretching the definition of emergency, setting a bad precedent and diverting money from other worthy projects? The clear answer is no. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

It’s called the 48-Hour Challenge. It encourages children to disappear for 48 hours. The missing child then racks up points for any mentions on social media regarding their whereabouts.

WASHINGTON— Congress lopsidedly approved a border security compromise that would avert a second painful government shutdown. But a new confrontation has been ignited — this time over President Donald Trump’s plan to bypass lawmakers and declare a national emergency to siphon billions of dollars from other federal coffers for his wall on the Mexican boundary. Money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the 200-plus miles (322 kilometers) he wanted. The White House said he’d sign the legi...

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/republicans-have-concerns-about-trumps-executive-action-too---split---Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement Friday that the president's national emergency declaration defies the Founders. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Some in the president’s party are wringing their hands about how the emergency declaration for a border wall might set a reckless precedent. While Congressional Republicans have raised concerns, most held off on denouncing the president’s radical maneuver to circumvent Article I of the Constitution and devote federal funds to a border wall without their approval. They wonder how a future Democratic president could circumvent Congress on liberal spending priorities like the Green New Deal — the sprawling plan supported by Democratic progressives to address climate change by restructuring the economy and phasing out fossil fuels. Among the most stinging criticisms came from Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers. The Tennessee Republican said Trump's national emergency declaration is, "is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution" and the congressional power of the purse. In a statement, Alexander also called the declaration both "unnecessary" and "unwise." “It is unwise because if this president can declare a national emergency to build a wall, the next president can declare a national emergency to tear it down; or declare a climate change emergency to close coal plants and build wind turbines; or a health care emergency and force into Medicare the 180 million Americans with health insurance on the job," Alexander said. “It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses," said Alexander, the Energy-Water chairman. "The Constitution gives that authority exclusively to a Congress elected by the people.” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., former Republican conference chair, said the declaration could subvert the balance of powers between branches of government. She said she worries it could open the door to passing a Green New Deal by fiat. “If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?” McMorris Rodgers said in a statement. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., echoed that concern. “Today’s national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal,” Rubio said in a statement. Rubio did not say whether he supported or opposed an emergency declaration, but instead said he would “wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also held off on staking a position on the national emergency declaration, but underscored his support for the president’s wall push. “The Constitution grants Congress the authority to appropriate federal dollars, so I’m sure such action will be litigated in the courts,” Grassley said in a statement. “What’s clear, however, is that the president takes the situation at our border seriously and that Democrats do not.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in a Thursday statement that the president will sign a budget deal to avert a government shutdown. In the same statement, she announced the president would “take other executive action — including a national emergency.” According to White House aides, a national emergency declaration would grant Trump broad authority to redirect money appropriated to the Pentagon and U.S. Treasury in order to construct a border wall. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was concerned about how an emergency declaration would weaken the power of Congress to appropriate federal funds. It “strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the will of Congress and of being of dubious constitutionality,” Collins said in an interview with USA Today. Here are some of the other Republicans who have raised concerns about an emergency declaration for a border wall: Rep. Chris Stewart Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said a Democratic president could deem climate change or gun violence a national emergency in order to outmaneuver Congress on appropriating tax dollars. “Whether the president has the authority or not, it sets a dangerous precedent and places America on a path that we will regret,” he said. “It deeply worries me that a future Democratic president may consider gun violence or climate change a ‘national emergency’ and what actions they may then take.” Sen. Mitt Romney Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, supported the budget deal but said an emergency declaration is not the “right approach.” I'll reserve judgment on any potential executive action by the President until I'm able to fully evaluate it, but as I’ve said, I don't believe declaring a national emergency is the right approach. I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limits.  Sen. Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., supports a border wall, but the libertarian senator said he opposes the emergency declaration, which he described as “extraconstitutional.” “I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them,” Paul said. Rep. Will Hurd The Texas congressman and only Republican to represent a district along the southern border, said in an appearance on The View that about “1,000 landowners are going to be impacted. And guess what? They're going to sue.” Rep. Will Hurd on how landowners in his district along the border will react to the wall: "They're going to sue because in the great state of Texas, we care about a little thing called 'private property rights.'" https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/5811OdClp4  Rep. Mike Turner “I supported this funding deal as a step towards securing our border, which we absolutely must do. However, I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the President to be forced to declare a national emergency because Congress refuses to provide necessary funding to protect our country," the Ohio Republican said in a statement. "As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects.” Sen. Mike Lee The Utah Republican, who supports an originalist view of the U.S. Constitution, issued a gentle criticism of the president's Article I workaround on Twitter Friday afternoon. "My initial assessment is that what Pres. Trump announced is legal. Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter," Lee said. "Congress has been ceding far too much power to the exec. branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back."

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/they-think-northam-should-get-another-chance-its-complicated---split---Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has been doing a lot of learning this month — about blackface, apologies and redemption. African-Americans who believe he should stay in his post are used to making political compromises to survive, Curtis writes. (Alex Edelman/Getty Images) OPINION — The lessons of this February’s Black History Month commemorations have already veered far beyond the usual ones that begin and end by quoting a snippet of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech — the part about judging folks not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. A new curriculum is being written in real time, affecting real-life politicians and their constituents. And Virginia is hardly the only state not ready for the big exam. Of course, the politician in question, Gov. Ralph Northam, has been learning as he goes — about blackface, about apologies and about redemption. It is no surprise that those most qualified to teach forgiveness have been the African-American citizens of his state. They have had lots of practice since the first enslaved people were brought to Virginia 400 years ago. A Washington Post poll shows that most believe he should stay in his post and do the job he was elected to do. Part of that may be “better the devil you know.” But it is also clear in several stories published about his own history that the motivation of those who think Northam has made the right decision in choosing not to exit quietly is more complicated than that. Friends of every race who have known Northam since he grew up on Virginia’s Eastern shore paint the picture of a man who was a good, fair and friendly classmate in a high school that changed from white to majority black after desegregation was finally implemented years and lawsuits after 1954’s Brown v. Board of Education. That decision led to massive official resistance to integration. Virginia closed its public schools rather than comply, leaving white students to enter segregated academies and black student to fend for themselves. Also watch: Trump calls on Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign The personal and public kindnesses of Northam through high school and then college at Virginia Military Institute stood out for many who spoke with reporters. They are saddened by the caricature that has spawned outrage and Saturday Night Live skits. Reverend King also once said, “It is appalling that the most segregated hour of Christian America is 11 o’clock on Sunday morning.” Though that still holds true in many communities, Northam and his wife attend a church congregation with mostly black worshippers, led by a black pastor. That’s not saying the embattled governor deserves a medal for acting like a human being. It is understandable that some of those voters who supported him feel betrayed. When Northam said he did not become aware until a few years ago of the pain of blackface — and when Attorney General Mark Herring confessed to his own moment imitating rap artists all too authentically — it was difficult to believe that they reached adulthood that clueless. But then it wasn’t. Teachers, schools and parents are still letting children of all races down when they skip over inconvenient history, when textbooks call enslaved people “workers,” “immigrants” and “indentured servants,” as Northam himself did on CBS and was quickly corrected by Gayle King. The morning anchor, who is African-American, would not have ascended to her prestigious job with so many blank spaces where knowledge should be. But it is still possible for white Americans to become a governor or attorney general or a CEO and have no idea about African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans and Native Americans, their histories, contributions and struggles, and the advantage that gave white citizens. It helps explain the inequities in wealth, housing, education and job opportunities whose effects persist long after slavery and Jim Crow. There is a reason some die-hard Cleveland Indians fans cling to the grinning Chief Wahoo and Covington Catholic school boys and their teachers thought war whoops and tomahawk chops were harmless fun. Which brings me, and all of us, to the president of the United States and Republican politicians in Virginia and beyond, who are enjoying the spectacle — popcorn in hand — of Democrats imploding in a state that had been trending blue. While Northam, however clumsily, is calling for learning and healing, the GOP looks eager to shut it and the governor down. It’s not that they are champions of liberty, justice and equal opportunity for all. In fact, when Donald Trump, looking to take advantage, took to Twitter to sow racial division by exploiting the scandals — and to compare the Democratic Party’s treatment of Northam, Herring and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who has denied sexual assault charges by two women — Twitter roared back, reminding the president of his own road to the White House, paved with birtherism and racist insults. There is plenty of evidence, from housing discrimination lawsuits that padded the Trump fortune, to administration policy that separated parents from children and then lost track of them, to a recent possible reference to the Trail of Tears to score points on an opponent (and the current president’s worship of that policy’s father, President Andrew Jackson, for whom the removal of Native Americans from their land was a priority). Republicans may pull Iowa Rep. Steve King from committees as payment for his vocal support of white nationalist ideals, but the congressman remains in his U.S. House seat. The African-Americans who want to give Northam another chance are used to the compromise needed to survive. In this case, a governor who champions voting rights and Medicaid expansion looks pretty good compared with a GOP moving in the other direction. And most Virginians of any race realize that Republicans, like Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, managing editor of a 1968 VMI yearbook sprinkled with blackface photos and racist slurs, have less than pristine racial pasts. Every February, someone asks why we need a Black History Month. And every February, and the rest of the year, comes the proof of the price each American pays for playing politics instead of putting aside the inconvenient conversations that may cause pain, but ultimately will keep the country from making the same costly mistakes over and over again.

Read more For decades, China had no closer American friend than Dianne Feinstein. An attempt by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin to calm plunging financial markets backfired Monday, further rattling investors with new fears about whether major U.S. banks have enough cash on top of worries about interest rates, political instability in Washington and a slowing global economy. He’s a failed U.S. Senate candidate with an undistinguished congressional record who, for the moment, is a blazing-hot 2020 presidential prospect — despite the fact that he may not run and faces long odds if he does. Months after President Trump took office, Russia’s disinformation teams trained their sites on a new target: special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Having worked to help get Trump into the White House, they now worked to neutralize the biggest threat to his staying there. The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former FBI director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies. One post on Instagram — which emerged as an especially potent weapon in the Russian social media arsenal — claimed that Mueller had worked in the past with “radical Islamic groups.” Such tactics exemplified how Russian teams ranged nimbly across social media platforms in a shrewd online influence operation aimed squarely at American voters. The effort started earlier than commonly understood and lasted longer while relying on the strengths of different sites to manipulate distinct slices of the electorate, according to a pair of comprehensive new reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released Monday.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/italy-five-star-movement-techno-utopians/---split---On the night of Italy’s 2013 parliamentary elections, Paola Nugnes decided to stay late at her office and catch up on work. She skipped the rolling election coverage on TV. And by the time she finally left her architecture studio to go out, it was well past dark. When she arrived at Mumble Rumble, a nightclub in western Naples, at around 9 pm, Nugnes still hadn’t checked the news. The club was hosting a party for activists in a political movement Nugnes had been part of for the past six years. And as she walked in, the crowd erupted. Nugnes asked if her friend Roberto Fico, the most famous local figure in the group, had won his race for a seat in Parliament. But before anyone could answer, a pack of journalists pounced, thrusting microphones in her face: “How do you feel about being elected?” Nugnes stared at them, dumbfounded. That’s how she found out she was now a senator. Along with hundreds of other political rookies, Nugnes had run for office under the banner of something called Five Star, an online phenomenon whose explosive, organic rise was shocking even to those it had just swept into power. Just a few years before, in the mid-2000s, the movement had been little more than the fan base of a blog fronted by a foulmouthed comedian, Beppe Grillo; from there it became an earnest protest movement organized around Meetup.com groups called Friends of Grillo; then it had unified under the name Five Star in 2009. The movement tapped deeply into one of the most powerful forces in Italian politics: disgust with Italian politics. Rather than offer an ideology or platform, Five Star offered a wholesale rebuke of the country’s entrenched, highly paid, careerist political class—left, right, and center. And it married that disdain to a grand techno-utopian project: Through an online voting and debate portal, Five Star was building a direct democracy on the internet. The long-term goal was to replace Parliament altogether—to automate it out of existence. But in the meantime, Five Star had also decided to displace the establishment seat by seat. How Trump Could Wind up Making Globalism Great Again The Political Education of Silicon Valley Why Tech Worker Dissent Is Going Viral The 2013 election was Five Star’s first foray into national politics. While a handful of its candidates were expected to win their races, Nugnes highly doubted she would be one of them; she barely gave it a thought, in fact. So Nugnes had worked through the evening, while the rest of the country reeled from the news that Five Star was now Italy’s second-biggest party, having swept 25 percent of the vote, upending the political establishment in a single stroke. Amid the whirl of embraces and congratulations at the election night party, Nugnes struggled to think through the ramifications. “We were all very excited—and frightened,” she says. She would have to quit her architecture studio. “It was very traumatic,” she says. A couple hours’ drive up the coast, near Rome, Elena Fattori, a molecular biologist who was also active in Five Star, faced a similar bout of disbelief that night. “I had taken it all very lightly,” she says of her run for the senate—so much so that she volunteered to help supervise the vote count that day. As she watched the running tally, Fattori could see firsthand that Five Star was far exceeding expectations and, eventually, that she herself had been elected. “It was a shock,” Fattori tells me. “I took a couple of days to accept it.” All told, some 160 Five Star candidates with virtually no experience in politics became members of Parliament that day. This put the movement in an awkward position. Governments in Italy are normally formed via alliances between two or more parties that can command a majority of seats in Parliament; Five Star had won so many seats that it had the option of going straight into a governing coalition with the first-placed bloc, led by the center-left Democratic Party. But that was out of the question: One of Five Star’s founding principles was “no alliances.” And besides, the movement saw the Democratic Party as central to the corrupt establishment it had sworn to fight. So Five Star went into opposition. While Five Star sees itself as neither right- nor left-wing, much of the party’s base is left-leaning. Many of its voters and activists, including Fattori and Nugnes, were drawn to the movement after becoming disenchanted with the Democrats and other parties on the left. Nugnes, a woman with Marxist sympathies, had grown alienated from Italy’s communist parties, which she viewed as ailing, top-down institutions. “I felt like an orphan,” she recalls. Five Star, by contrast, was a “cultural revolution,” a horizontal movement that put governing directly in the hands of anyone who cared to log on. To the extent that Five Star did have a political platform, it vaguely resembled that of a Green Party. The movement’s name ostensibly refers to its first five policy priorities: sustainable transportation, sustainable development, public water, universal internet access, and environmentalism. Nugnes was particularly attracted to the movement’s more recent flagship policy, a universal basic income that proposed a monthly stipend of 780 euros (a bit less than $900) for Italy’s poorest citizens. In short: While the movement had always included people across the political spectrum, it was easily taken for a progressive popular front. Members of Five Star reeled at where their movement had ended up: tied to a party led by a man many of them regarded as a fascist. But if Nugnes and Fattori were shocked to become elected members of government, the next few years would be even more vertiginous. As the movement’s fledgling nonpoliticians found their feet in Parliament, they realized that dealing with other parties was unavoidable. At times, in opposing the Democratic Party–led government, Five Star found itself siding with another faction defined by antiestablishment roots—a right-wing populist party called Lega, or the League. Lega’s nativist leader, Matteo Salvini, had long campaigned on an “Italians first” platform. He has said that his country needs a “mass cleansing” of illegal immigrants, “street by street, district by district, piazza by piazza.” When Italy’s 2018 national elections came around, Five Star—whose emphasis on popular sovereignty had, at times, come to sound sympatico with anti-EU, anti-immigrant sentiment—won so many seats that it became the largest party in Italy. This time, the movement didn’t shy from stepping up to run the country. And it chose to do so in partnership with Salvini’s Lega. Last September, Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump and would-be pied piper to Europe’s ethno-nationalists, visited Rome to celebrate the alliance. Of all the countries he had visited in his recent travels, he singled out Italy as “the center of the political universe.” The new government there was a Bannonite dream come true: a left-right, antiestablishment coalition. “A populist party with nationalist tendencies like the Five Stars, and a nationalist party with populist tendencies like the League,” he enthused to Politico’s European edition. “It’s imperative that this works, because this shows a model for industrial democracies from the US to Asia.” While Bannon gushed, members of Five Star like Nugnes and Fattori reeled at where their movement had ended up: tied to a party led by a man many of them regarded as a fascist. They were also beginning to realize that Five Star’s evolution had never been as organic as it seemed. At every step along the way—from the creation of Grillo’s blog and the organization of the movement’s first mass protests to the construction of its direct-democracy platform, all the way to its recent turn toward nativist politics—Five Star’s course had been meticulously directed by a camera-shy cyber-utopian named Gianroberto Casaleggio, the movement’s cofounder. Casaleggio, who died of brain cancer in 2016, was, in some ways, a familiar type. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he and a slew of other Internet Age prophets—many of them writing in this magazine—foretold a digital revolution that would flatten the priesthoods of politics, government, and journalism, and replace them with decentralized webs of direct participation. But Casaleggio, unlike his fellow pundits, actually went on to mount a revolutionary force that took over a country. Not only that, he directed this supposedly leaderless movement while drawing barely any attention to himself. So here’s the mystery at the heart of Five Star: Who the hell was Gianroberto Casaleggio—and how did he do it? Gianroberto Casaleggio: Cofounder and intellectual father of the movement. Beppe Grillo: The movement’s cofounder and front man. Luigi Di Maio: A Casaleggio protégé, elected the leader of Five Star in 2017. Alessandro Di Battista: Another Casaleggio protégé and one of the movement’s most visible members. Roberto Fico: Unofficial leader of Five Star’s left wing. Paola Nugnes: Left-wing Five Star senator who has been critical of the movement’s rightward turn. The small city of Ivrea sits cradled in the foothills of the Italian Alps, 30 miles south of the Swiss border. An 18th-century bridge over the Dora Baltea river leads to a quaint historic downtown of cobbled streets and pastel-colored buildings. But in the 1970s, Ivrea was Italy’s answer to Silicon Valley. It was the hometown of Olivetti, an icon of postwar European design, electronics, and manufacturing. The company’s most famous devices—its portable typewriters—were the Apple products of their day, technological fetish objects that were coveted around the world. In the early days of the computer industry, Olivetti was one of the few European contenders for market dominance; in 1965, it released the world’s first device marketed commercially as a “desktop computer.” The young Gianroberto Casaleggio was one of Olivetti’s software designers. A local with a long mane of frizzy hair, he had studied physics in college before dropping out and turning to computers. He ended up in a small office on a quiet lane developing Olivetti’s operating systems. Enrica Zublena, an engineer who worked next to Casaleggio for many years, remembers their early days at the company as an exciting time. “We thought we could become a reference point for the evolution of basic IT around the world,” Zublena says. Olivetti was a heady place to work in other ways as well, especially for anyone prone to utopian thinking. Adriano Olivetti, the late owner and general manager of the firm, had run his company as a kind of philosopher-CEO. He built futuristic factories and living complexes for his workers in Ivrea and advocated a “third way” between right and left sociopolitical thinking; he started his own political movement—a fusion of liberalism, socialism, and local self-determinism—which took him all the way to Parliament. He also wrote books expounding on his views. In one, Democracy Without Political Parties, he argued that technology should be used to hand the mechanics of politics back to citizens. Casaleggio shared Olivetti’s interest in the transformative potential of computing. “We saw the birth of the client-server model in IT,” Zublena says—the emergence of systems that distribute tasks among many computers in a network, allowing distant nodes to cooperate. “It brought a level of decisionmaking freedom to the periphery.” It seemed inevitable to Casaleggio that such architectures would change everything in society. By the 1990s, Casaleggio was running his own company, and it was his turn to play philosopher-CEO. The firm, which was eventually called Webegg, quickly became one of the leading internet consulting outfits in Italy, doing a brisk business helping older firms to find “web-based solutions” and otherwise navigate the bewildering world of bits, messaging software, and online marketing. “It was the time of the first call centers, the first internet banking,” says Zublena, who followed her colleague to Webegg. But Casaleggio was impatient to explore the grander implications of the internet. In a monthly column for a magazine called Web Marketing Tools, he inveighed against the drabness of most thinking about the web. “The net has been reduced to an instrument of financial speculation and marketing,” he wrote, but its true significance was as a force for “radical social and revolutionary change.” Perhaps most of all, Casaleggio was interested in how the internet would transform organizations from the inside. Accordingly, he turned Webegg into a laboratory for sometimes bizarre social experimentation. Throughout his career, Casaleggio liked to give extraordinary responsibilities to his youngest, most talented, and most impressionable recruits. One such hire at Webegg was a Bolognese engineer named Carlo Baffè. When he arrived fresh out of school in 1997, Baffè was promptly handed the reins to one of the company’s biggest projects. “Don’t worry,” Casaleggio reassured him. “Napoleon invaded Italy when he was 26.” About a year later, Baffè got another call. “I have this new special project in mind,” Casaleggio told him. “Would you like to join?” Baffè accepted eagerly. He went to the company’s Milan headquarters and, in a meeting room near Casaleggio’s office, sat at a circular table with the CEO and four other young, excited employees, all from different parts of the firm. Casaleggio explained that the aim of this new project was to experiment with communication dynamics on the company’s intranet. Casaleggio would select topics from the firm’s internal forum and assign members of the group specific roles to play in each discussion. Say he wanted a forum debate to reach conclusion X: One member of the restricted group would suggest X, a second would argue for contradictory conclusion Y, and over time a third would post a variation on X—and so on, subtly driving the rest of the unwitting employees toward the preordained conclusion. Baffè and the other experimenters worked a few hours a week on the project and met with Casaleggio once a month to evaluate progress. The original stated aim of the project was to observe how internal electronic communications worked, and then to sell the findings as a consulting service. But the experiment also had more far-reaching implications, Baffè realized. Casaleggio was interested in learning how consensus—on, say, whether people should be happy to work long hours—could be manufactured in a way that looked organic. Twenty years before trolls working for Russia’s Internet Research Agency would use similar techniques to steer debate on Facebook and other online forums, Casaleggio seemed to be using his own company as a laboratory to figure out how online discourse could be guided from above. “I’d just started working and was excited to be part of a project like that,” Baffè says. It wasn’t until years later, he says, that he “realized it was the beginning of a long-term experiment.” The intranet study group was only one such special project. Baffè was also invited to join another select group of about 20 employees who were given advanced communications training, grounded in something called neuro-linguistic programming. A new-age therapeutic phenomenon, NLP purportedly offers a means to influence people by surreptitiously tapping into the unconscious patterns that guide their behavior. Practitioners are taught that people can be “reprogrammed” —to shed a phobia, say, or desire a product—with relative ease. “It taught us how to classify people,” Baffè says: By identifying which kinds of metaphors a client favored, employees at Webegg could aim to “mirror” that client, making them more susceptible to the company’s message. The sessions also focused on the teachings of an American hypnotherapist named Milton H. Erickson, who likewise made extraordinary claims about the suggestibility of the unconscious mind. By subtly confusing and unsettling his patients, Erickson claimed that he could induce them into trance states that made them more pliable. (NLP is popular among sales gurus and with the modern pickup artist community, but psychologists tend to regard it as a pseudoscience.) The monthly sessions were led by two psychologists, a man and a woman, and they were a bit like “group therapy,” Baffè says. Employees were encouraged to air their feelings. At first, Baffè was thrilled to take part. But gradually his enthusiasm waned as he began to wonder who, exactly, was being influenced. The psychologists were seemingly omnipresent in the Webegg offices, where they appeared to be keeping tabs on staff for Casaleggio. “I’m sure he controlled every single detail of their activity,” Baffè says. (WIRED spoke to one of the psychologists, who confirmed that she had worked with Webegg and called Casaleggio a “true visionary” but declined to be interviewed.) In practice, Casaleggio’s intranet discussions, group sessions, and psychological interventions often seemed to be a means of bypassing directors and team leaders—the firm’s middlemen—to exert maximal influence over his staff. “The channel is direct between the boss and every employee,” Baffè says. Increasingly, the young engineer started to see Casaleggio as an “evil scientist.” This impression was reinforced by his boss’s increasingly eccentric behavior. During the Y2K panic, Casaleggio printed out a “decalogue”—a set of 10 commandments—telling employees what to do if civilization collapsed. He wrote a magazine column praising Genghis Khan’s (apocryphal) practice of murdering his generals at random as an effective means of keeping subordinates and intermediaries on their toes. Khan, he wrote, “became the greatest conqueror in history with the application of techniques and principles that are necessary today to compete on the web.” “The interactive leader will then be the new politician,” Casaleggio wrote, “someone who continually transforms the wishes of public opinion into reality.” But even as he praised Khan’s absolute rule, Casaleggio also extolled the absolute power that masses of people would have over their leaders in the internet era. In a 2001 book entitled The Web Is Dead, Long Live the Web, Casaleggio described how technology would force governments to become completely transparent and accountable to the will of the people. “Referenda on topics of national importance will become as routine as reading the papers or the evening news,” he wrote. “The interactive leader will then be the new politician, someone who continually transforms the wishes of public opinion into reality. This new politician will not need interpretation by today’s media, which will thus lose their importance.” Like any number of cyber-utopians writing in places like WIRED—several of whose writers he cited in his work—Casaleggio repeatedly predicted the imminent demise of journalism. He held that in a few years, information would become a utility, like electricity or water, pervading people’s daily lives; it would replace the current “virtual reality” that the press had constructed for them, “the Matrix that surrounds us.” To his point, the media Matrix in Italy was exceptionally claustrophobic: In 2001, the scandal-prone media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi had just begun his second term as prime minister; not only did he own the biggest commercial television network, he also dominated the state broadcaster, RAI. While Casaleggio was busy peering into the future, he was neglecting more run-of-the-mill sources of revenue that Webegg needed to turn a profit. “He put all the best people on the new stuff that was very sexy for him,” Baffè says. But the company’s core business foundered. “At some point,” Baffè says, “his ego took over.” Amid mounting financial losses, Casaleggio was forced out in 2003 by the company’s main shareholder, Telecom Italia. Webegg closed shortly thereafter. Casaleggio had the contacts and experience to remain a player in the Italian tech industry, but by then his interest in the early internet was pivoting from business to another arena: politics. Even those who knew Casaleggio well (but who perhaps didn’t read his books closely) were surprised by the sudden turn. Zublena remembers telling him, “But Gianroberto, you’ve never been remotely interested in politics!” In response, the usually taciturn Casaleggio burst out laughing, exposing the boyish gap between his front two teeth. “Come on,” she persisted, “with all the things in the world, you’re going into politics?” But Casaleggio only laughed and kept his reasons to himself. Edoardo Narduzzi, who had known Casaleggio since 1998 and served as a Webegg board member, thinks Casaleggio saw “an interesting space” in Italian politics, ripe for testing out his ideas for a web-based, bottom-up movement—“a political startup.” It all began with a simple punt. In 2004, Casaleggio ran as an independent candidate in his home village, near Ivrea. Out of 294 votes cast for a seat on a local council, Casaleggio won just six. That didn’t mean he would give up. All he needed was a front man. As Italy’s top barnstorming comedian, Beppe Grillo was accustomed to overzealous fans. But none made an impression like the visitor who came to see him one night in April 2004. After a show in the coastal city of Livorno, Gianroberto Casaleggio appeared at Grillo’s dressing room door and introduced himself as a web entrepreneur. But with his shock of wild gray hair, John Lennon glasses, and quiet intensity, Grillo recalls, he seemed more like an “evil genius.” Grillo recounts this first meeting in a preface he wrote for Casaleggio’s next book, Web Ergo Sum. “He explained webcasting to me, direct democracy, chatterbots, wiki, downshifting, usability, objects of digital interaction, social networks, Reed’s law, intranets, and copyleft,” Grillo recalled. He likened Casaleggio to the medieval radical Saint Francis of Assisi, but “instead of talking to wolves and to the birds, he spoke to the internet.” The comedian was initially wary: “Everything was clear,” Grillo wrote, “he was a madman.” But Casaleggio’s madness was one that envisioned a better future thanks to the web: companies made democratic, the end of political intermediation, and the devolution of power down to the individual. Before long, Grillo fell under Casaleggio’s spell—which was remarkable, given that Grillo had famously long been a technophobe. For a time, he had been known for smashing computers with a sledgehammer during his act. Casaleggio offered to build Grillo a blog. The comedian was a household name in Italy, but he’d been sacked from state television in the 1980s after making an off-color joke about corruption in the then-Socialist government. Now Casaleggio was offering him a new route to a mass audience and a way out of endless theater tours: the internet. “We’re going to become one of the three top blogs in the world,” Casaleggio promised. And so began a partnership that would transform Italian politics. On January 26, 2005, nine months after Casaleggio’s visit to Grillo’s dressing room in Livorno, the blog, beppegrillo.it, went live. It was, at the start, a simple black and white affair, firing out a post or two a day. The few tabs listed tour dates, information on Grillo’s latest show—fairly typical elements of a fan page. But another tab, labeled “How to Use the Blog,” gestured at something more grand and open-ended. “Beppe Grillo’s blog is an open space at your disposal,” the page explained. “Its usefulness depends on your collaboration; for this reason, you are the real and only person responsible for the content and its fate.” Grillo’s first posts were short and snappy. “Is there any sense in still speaking of right, or left, or center?” ranted one. “We don’t need a leader, we are adults!” Within months, the number of commenters on any given post had mushroomed into the hundreds, and soon thousands. Posts became ever more detailed and elaborate, with embedded video, images, and cartoons. Video and phone interviews with intellectuals brought in the likes of economist Joseph Stiglitz, Italian playwright Dario Fo, and Noam Chomsky. The blog hosted articles and letters by other writers; it started to seem more like a cultural institution than a comedian’s promo page. Today, when the most prominent members of Five Star think back to what got them hooked on beppegrillo.it, most of them describe how it provided a compelling source of alternative information: a rival to the traditional, Berlusconi-dominated media. Alessandro Di Battista was a young university graduate in music and performing arts when he started frequenting the site. “I read in Beppe’s blog what I’d always wanted to read in the newspapers, but that you could never find,” Di Battista says. Grillo’s blog dealt in “counterinformation,” as Di Battista calls it, “taking political positions that seemed to me fundamental but that no one else had the courage to take.” A blog post announced a new Meetup group called Friends of Beppe Grillo, through which readers could “transform a virtual debate into a moment of change.” Beginning that first year, Grillo and Casaleggio also used the blog to push their readers toward political action. They launched initiatives like Parlamento Pulito, or “Clean Parliament,” an email-writing campaign to protest the number of elected officials in Italy with criminal convictions. And in July 2005, six months after the website’s launch, a blog post announced a new group on Meetup called Friends of Beppe Grillo, through which readers could arrange to meet, discuss, and “transform a virtual debate into a moment of change.” Several such groups instantly popped up around the country, including one in Naples started by a recent communications graduate named Roberto Fico. “Within two months, there were almost 300 members,” Fico says. The young Fico poured all of his spare time into the burgeoning Friends of Grillo movement as he cycled through jobs in PR, tourism, and at a call center. “As soon as I finished work, I’d go to the meetings, the demonstrations,” he says. Thanks in part to his group’s activism, in 2006 a local Democratic Party water privatization scheme was successfully blocked. “The point,” Fico says, “was that it was political, but outside the institutions.” In addition to commenting on posts and joining Meetup groups, beppegrillo.it also urged its readers to start their own blogs. One such fan turned blogger was a young college dropout named Marco Canestrari. In September 2006, the unemployed Canestrari happened to meet Casaleggio at an event; he had no idea who the older man was. But Casaleggio told him, “I know you who you are; I follow your blog.” Shortly thereafter, Casaleggio offered Canestrari a job at his new internet consulting firm, Casaleggio Associates. Canestrari, 23, could hardly believe his luck: “That was my first job, actually.” Based in an exclusive neighborhood in Milan, Casaleggio Associates employed about 10 people at the time—most of them former employees of Webegg. The young Canestrari found his new boss “very clever, interesting, and exciting,” an avid reader of history, comics, and science fiction, particularly the novels of Isaac Asimov. Despite their age gap, Canestrari and Casaleggio, then in his fifties, formed a close rapport, with Casaleggio often expounding on his views about the web and the future. “He basically talked about that all day, all the time,” says Canestrari, one of the few people Casaleggio took into confidence. Within a short time, Casaleggio—in keeping with his habit of delegating large tasks to unformed young men—made Canestrari a manager of beppegrillo.it. After just three years, Grillo’s page was already the most popular site on the Italian internet and one of the 10 most-read blogs in the world. But the fact that most astounded Canestrari as he took up his new position was this: “Grillo never wrote a single word on the blog,” he says. Grillo and Casaleggio would speak several times a day to discuss the contents of the daily posts, and Casaleggio might read out the final draft to Grillo over the phone, says Filippo Pittarello, another employee who helped to produce the site. But according to multiple sources, it was Casaleggio, not Grillo, who actually wrote the hottest blog in Italy. Just like the page’s millions of readers, Canestrari had no inkling of this before coming to work for Casaleggio. Far from feeling hoodwinked, he was thrilled to see behind the curtain. At Casaleggio’s side, he would get to play a vital role in a political revolution. In 2007, the staff at Casaleggio Associates celebrated the millionth comment on beppegrillo.it. Casaleggio spent whole days reading the comments, according to Canestrari and Pittarello, and he recognized a lot of the commenters, especially the more active ones. He thought that, through the blog, he was seeing into the belly of Italy—what its people really thought and felt. And what he noticed was anger. Casaleggio had recently watched V for Vendetta, a 2005 dystopian futuristic thriller. (Tagline: “People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.”) In the film, Britain is ruled by a fascist dictatorship; one night, a lone insurgent wearing a Guy Fawkes mask hacks into a state-controlled news broadcast and tells the people of Britain to meet him outside Parliament in exactly one year, setting in motion the end of the regime. Inspired by the movie, Casaleggio wrote a late-night post, published under Grillo’s name, on June 14, 2007. Beneath a picture of a Guy Fawkes mask, Casaleggio summoned all of Grillo’s readers to gather in person for something called Vaffanculo Day, or “Fuck Off Day,” in three months’ time—a mass collective middle finger to the political establishment. The morning after writing the post, on his way to the office, Casaleggio reportedly called and told his son, Davide—who was also a young employee at Casaleggio Associates—to gather the rest of the staff for a breakfast meeting downstairs. “We have to do something big,” Casaleggio told the group, according to a book that Canestrari later cowrote about the origins of Five Star, called Supernova. “The anger is rising, and if we don’t let it vent in some way, it’ll die out.” The ostensible purpose of V Day would be to ratchet up the Parlamento Pulito campaign. The goal: to collect signatures to force a law that would limit elected representatives to two terms and ban candidates with criminal convictions. But the deeper purpose was to muster a show of force—to demonstrate that the movement wasn’t just a virtual phenomenon. Canestrari worked day and night over the next three months, coordinating with Friends of Grillo Meetup groups to mobilize them. Casaleggio called every contact he had. The Italian web fizzed with anticipation; the national press was silent. The day before V Day, Canestrari and Pittarello drove down from Milan to Bologna, where a giant stage was being set up in the city’s main plaza. By the afternoon of V Day, September 8, 2007, the square had swollen with a crowd of about 50,000 people. All around Italy, in some 200 squares, other crowds were massing too. In Naples, people started lining up at 9 am to sign petitions, says Fico, who ran the signature-collecting campaign in his home city. “We couldn’t believe our eyes.” When Grillo got to the microphone in Bologna at around 4:30 pm, he took in the crowd, visibly shaken. It was enormous. “Boh … what have we done?” he finally said, teetering around the stage and shaking his head in disbelief. Gathering himself, he launched into a typically throat-tearing tirade against Italy’s ruling elite. The success of V Day was thrilling. Two million people had turned out across the country; 350,000 signatures were gathered for the Parlamento Pulito. And it had all been meticulously planned by Casaleggio Associates. “The entire company was there that day,” Canestrari says. Yes, the grassroots Meetup groups had been in charge of collecting signatures, “but everything else—everything else—was organized by us.” And if anyone asked who Canestrari and his colleagues were? “We called ourselves the ‘Beppe Grillo staff,’ so nobody knew.” The vast majority of people in the movement had no idea that Casaleggio or his consulting firm even existed. “Grillo has always been the front man, and he knew that,” Canestrari says. “And it was fun for him. But he never made a real decision about anything.” Hoping to channel the energy of V Day, Friends of Grillo groups around the country started to talk about putting some of their members forward as independent candidates in local elections. Paola Nugnes ran for a seat in the regional senate of Campania. Roberto Fico ran for the presidency of the same region. Alessandro Di Battista ran in municipal elections in his native Rome. The idea was that, even with just a few elected officials at the lowest levels, the movement’s “counterinformation” would inexorably seep into town and regional governments. With this turn toward electoral politics, Casaleggio told Canestrari to start developing an online platform to unify the disparate Meetup groups: a single web portal with a forum. Casaleggio also wanted to give some shape to the movement’s politics. “Let’s set some rules,” he said. Friends of Grillo members elected to office would have to observe a two-term limit. No candidates with criminal convictions were allowed, nor were those who had ever sought election under another party. Just a few fixed principles, Casaleggio said, like Asimov’s three laws of robotics. The rules offered insurance that the movement’s politicians would be amateurs, not careerists. They also ensured that Grillo could never run for office in his own movement: He had been convicted of manslaughter in 1981 after a tragic car accident. The Friends of Grillo barely made a showing in those early local elections; many candidates, including Fico and Di Battista, failed to get more than 1 or 2 percent of the vote. But their careers in politics were far from over. On October 4, 2009—as the global economic crisis began to pummel Italy, setting off a decade of malaise and widespread youth unemployment—the Five Star Movement was officially launched in a packed theater in Milan. From the stage, Grillo said they were starting the party because no one was listening to them, but he admitted that he wasn’t sure what they were doing or where they were going. Casaleggio, however, knew exactly where they were headed: Rome. A Five Star demonstration in Rome in 2013, shortly after the movement sent 163 of its members to serve in Italy’s Parliament. Five Star’s attempts at competing in local and regional politics in the next few years were fairly undistinguished. The party did well in Sicily’s regional vote in October 2012, after Grillo, 64, swam to the island from mainland Italy in a media stunt. (A life-jacketed Casaleggio followed by boat.) But ahead of 2013’s general election, the movement’s huge slate of candidates was barely polling in the double digits. No one was prepared, in other words, when Five Star stormed into Italy’s Parliament with 25 percent of the vote in February 2013. Casaleggio suddenly found himself an object of morbid public fascination. The Italian press was relentless in its scrutiny—and its derision—of the bizarre-looking web entrepreneur turning Italian politics on its head. The papers often described Casaleggio as Grillo’s “guru.” The business daily Il Sole 24 Ore wrote that Casaleggio ran Five Star “like the cult of Genghis Khan.” Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by the Berlusconi family, mocked a 2008 video that Casaleggio had made as the ravings of a crank. (The short animated film, which refers darkly to the Masons and the Bilderberg Group, envisions an apocalyptic world war that will usher in a single, global direct democracy, administered by Google.) “I will never forget how they treated him,” says Alessandro Di Battista, who’d just been elected to the lower house. At the same time, 163 brand-new, almost wholly inexperienced Five Star MPs also came under the media’s klieg lights. Unsurprisingly for a movement with no ideological consistency or message discipline, the MPs offered plenty of fodder. The new leader of the lower house, Five Star’s Roberta Lombardi, made front-page news when it came out that she had once written a blog post that seemed to defend fascism and its original “socialist-inspired sense of national community.” And a live feed in which the new MPs earnestly introduced themselves to the public was met with widespread mockery. “Hi, I’m Simona,” went one parody. “I have a degree and I’m unemployed. I bend over backwards to manage my monthly budget and I want to be economy minister.” Casaleggio came to Rome to try to reassure the new MPs, many of whom had never met their party’s cofounder. “If we stay united,” he told them, “there’s no obstacle we can’t overcome.” Suffice it to say, they didn’t stay united. Several paradoxes were quickly emerging at the heart of the Five Star project. On the one hand, Casaleggio was busy developing the technology that would evenly distribute power across the breadth of the movement. By mid 2013, users of beppegrillo.it, still Five Star’s central website, could click through to a web portal where they could sign up as Five Star members, log in, and access a basic direct democracy platform—for the moment, a glorified web forum that let members review laws proposed by Five Star MPs, debate their content, and suggest wiki-style edits. Even still, users felt the thrill of direct participation in policymaking. But at the same time, Casaleggio was anxious to mold and prop up a few key leaders. Shortly after the elections, he invited a select group of the most telegenic young MPs to Milan for media and communications training. Di Battista, who had won a seat in the lower house, was one of them. So was Fico. They were joined by a young college dropout named Luigi Di Maio and a few others. The meetings were led by a TV coach who was skilled in, among other things, neuro-linguistic programming. Casaleggio began using the blog and, increasingly, social media to elevate this handpicked group to become the biggest political stars in Italy. They had little in common with each other, save that they had almost all been near-penniless young men before Casaleggio picked them up and mentored them. “Gianroberto was a second father to me,” Di Battista says. “He was the man who gave me the biggest opportunity of my life ... I have never known a person who knew how to listen like him.” Casaleggio maintained an arm’s-length relationship with the rest of Five Star’s parliamentary caucus. He hired a former journalist named Nicola Biondo to help run the movement’s press office in Rome and to run herd on the other new members of Parliament. Biondo regretted taking on the role after just a few weeks on the job. The Five Star MPs were difficult to manage. They often ignored his advice; they tried to make TV appearances that hadn’t been sanctioned by Casaleggio or Grillo. Time and again, Biondo would get a call from Casaleggio saying: “Why are they saying that?” Casaleggio was building an army of “digital soldiers” that could be steered against political adversaries, establishment figures, and internal dissenters alike. Things got worse when Casaleggio fell ill and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. “Some MPs tried to profit by his absence,” Biondo says. The web entrepreneur was desperate to stay in control of his wildly successful project, but he felt his grip weakening. Biondo recalls sitting in Casaleggio’s office one day; the older man placed a hand on Biondo’s leg and confided in him. “I’ve realized that in my political activity there are many people who wish me ill, who attack me with negative energy,” Casaleggio said. “I sense that so many people hate me.” Casaleggio seemed increasingly obsessed with the idea that people were out to get him. “He was constantly searching for people who would adore him, who would never question his intelligence,” says Biondo, who would go on to coauthor the book Supernova with Canestrari. Meanwhile, dissenters began to be expelled from the movement—one for going on TV without permission, another for criticizing the running of the party as a “feudal system of loyalty.” One MP was kicked out for calling Five Star a “cult of fanatics” in which criticism was not permitted. The movement was streamlining. MPs were reportedly told to hand over the usernames and passwords to their email accounts; some gave Casaleggio Associates access to their social media accounts as well. Rising stars like Di Battista and Di Maio were constantly posting on Facebook to their hundreds of thousands of followers, and Casaleggio appointed employees at his firm to study Google Analytics and Facebook Insights to monitor which social media posts went viral, so their success could be replicated. According to Biondo, Casaleggio was also building his online movement into an army of “digital soldiers” that could be steered against political adversaries, establishment figures, and internal dissenters alike. “He did the same on the blog as he did at Webegg,” Biondo says. “This is called social engineering.” Although Grillo’s blog had supposedly been founded to combat the virtual reality—the “Matrix”—of traditional media, Casaleggio’s employees at times peddled dubious information themselves. Some posts on the blog attacked obligatory vaccination in Italy, regurgitating unfounded claims that vaccines were linked to autism. The site also began to lead its readers toward political conclusions that strayed somewhat from Five Star’s origins. Despite the movement’s vaguely progressive cast of mind, Casaleggio himself had long harbored certain right-wing sympathies. He thought the rights of citizens should not become subservient to international bodies like the European Union, and he respected that populist parties like Lega often called for referenda in the name of self-determination. (As it happens, Casaleggio and the founders of Lega both share a common inspiration: the political philosophy of Adriano Olivetti.) And as Five Star attained real political power, Casaleggio set about steering it to the right. In 2014, Italian voters sent 17 members of Five Star to serve in the European Parliament, the body that oversees the European Union. According to one of the movement’s young delegates to Brussels, Marco Zanni, Casaleggio quickly made it clear that he wanted Five Star to ally with the UK Independence Party—the party led by far-right British provocateur Nigel Farage, whose lifelong mission was to get Britain to leave the European Union—in the EU Parliament. Five Star’s web portal now included a tool for subjecting important decisions to an online vote, and so the decision on whether to ally with UKIP was put to the movement: direct democracy in action. But in the days and weeks before the vote, Casaleggio published articles on the blog hailing Farage as a democratic crusader against a monolithic EU. “Farage Defends the Sovereignty of the Italian People,” read one headline. Another article, entitled “Nigel Farage, The Truth,” listed UKIP’s supposedly progressive credentials, such as being an “antiwar … democratic organization” where “no form of racism, sexism, or xenophobia is tolerated,” and which believes in “direct democracy.” The post that finally teed up the online vote made it very clear that the proposed alliance with UKIP was the best and only solution. According to Zanni, this was Casaleggio Associates’ modus operandi when it came to online votes: Provide a “cosmetic” appearance of choice while pushing for a particular option. In the end, 78 percent of the members who voted opted to join Farage. After years of studying how to shape online consensus, Casaleggio had mastered the art. The alliance with UKIP was just the beginning. On a crisp morning in January 2015, Casaleggio Associates received some unusual visitors: Farage, Raheem Kassam—then a UKIP strategist, later a Breitbart London editor and aide to Steve Bannon on his European missions—and Liz Bilney, the future CEO of pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU. The group wanted to learn how Five Star had pulled off its stunning political rise, and to grasp how it used technology—“to understand the mechanics of it all,” Bilney says. Casaleggio and his son, Davide, gave them a briefing that offered a timeline of important events in web-based politics and the development of Five Star. Then father and son explained the new and improved direct democracy platform they were developing for the movement. Soon, they said, registered members would be able to propose laws and debate and edit them, as well as use the portal to put themselves forward and select candidates in online ballots. As an engine for user engagement—a crucial metric in social media as in politics—the platform seemed formidable. Farage “thought it was fascinating,” Bilney says, “because UKIP were keen to build their membership.” Kassam agrees that Farage was “very excited” by the meeting. “He wanted me to go and look into the systems that they used,” Kassam says, “and how UKIP might implement them.” The Casaleggios didn’t share much technical know-how with the group, but Kassam was impressed by how many resources they were dedicating to Five Star’s digital operations and data analysis. Bilney, for her part, left the meeting buzzing with ideas about the way Five Star used social media. It was this meeting, she says, that “planted the seed of ideas” that would lead to the success of Brexit. Leave.EU was founded six months after the Milan meeting, and a year after that the UK voted to leave the EU. (Bilney is now under criminal investigation for allegedly breaking spending rules.) A few months after the meeting, a post on Grillo’s blog announced that the new version of Five Star’s online direct democracy platform was almost ready. It would be called Rousseau, and it would serve as the Five Star Movement’s mobile-friendly “operating system.” After users logged in, they would land on a homepage with different primary-colored windows for voting on candidates and party decisions, as well as for proposing and debating laws, participating in fund-raising, and more. Beppe Grillo had known that Rousseau—the long-awaited, all-singing, all-dancing version of the direct democracy web portal—was on its way. What he hadn’t been told was that Casaleggio Associates was also building a new website that would supplant beppegrillo.it as the online home of Five Star. Fearing he was being squeezed out, Grillo confronted Casaleggio. As recounted in the book Supernova, the phone call quickly turned sour: “Vaffanculo!” Casaleggio yelled down the line. “I never want to hear from you again.” “Vaffanculo!  ” Casaleggio yelled down the line. I never want to hear from you again.” Those were the last words Grillo would ever hear from Five Star’s cofounder. Those were the last words Grillo would ever hear from Casaleggio. Grillo initially agreed to a written interview for this article, only to later demand 1,000 euros per question, with a minimum of eight questions. I wondered if it was a weird joke—Grillo is famous for his offbeat humor—but a few days later a post appeared on his blog detailing his new tariff for conversations with the press. WIRED does not pay for interviews. Despite Grillo’s vital role in the rise of Five Star, Casaleggio arranged, from his deathbed, for the ascension of his son, Davide, to a position of great power within the movement. Legal documents signed just before Casaleggio’s death state that Rousseau was to be managed by a new organization, the Rousseau Association. The documents also set up Davide Casaleggio, the new CEO of Casaleggio Associates, to be the Rousseau Association’s president and treasurer. He is, in short, the absolute ruler of Five Star’s data. (Casaleggio declined to speak with WIRED.) Five Star’s MPs are forced by new rules to pay 300 euros a month toward the running of the platform. Grillo, for his part, retained the rights to Five Star’s name and logo. On April 12, 2016, Gianroberto Casaleggio died in Milan at the age of 61. As his coffin was carried out of the church that houses Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, a throng of Five Star supporters chanted “Onesta!” (“Honesty!”)—a party slogan. Di Maio and a tearful Di Battista led the chorus. Also in attendance was Umberto Bossi, the founder of Lega. Outside the funeral, a banner read: “We will realize your dream.” The day after Casaleggio died, Rousseau went live. As the 2018 national elections approached, Five Star took one more step away from its original conception as a horizontal, leaderless movement: Via an online ballot on Rousseau, it set about choosing an official party chief. Once again, the contest offered a somewhat cosmetic appearance of choice. Of the best-known, highly groomed members of Five Star, only Luigi Di Maio ran for the job. Fico and Di Battista kept their heads down. So Di Maio was pitted against a slate of relative unknowns, including Elena Fattori. To no one’s surprise, Di Maio won, becoming Five Star’s leader at 31 years old in the fall of 2017. Only about 30 percent of Rousseau’s members voted. Afterward, Grillo began to distance himself from the movement. In January 2018, when Grillo relaunched his blog, there wasn’t a Five Star logo in sight. Steve Bannon—the former White House chief strategist and far-right impresario—has been trying to unify Europe’s most strident populists into a supergroup called the Movement. Some nationalists have been receptive; others see him as an unwelcome foreign influence. (Go figure.) Five Star has held off on joining. Here’s how Bannon has fared elsewhere. —Graham Hacia BELGIUM - Mischaël Modrikamen: Cofounder of the Belgian People’s Party. Helped establish the Movement. ITALY - Matteo Salvini: Interior minister and leader of the anti-immigrant party Lega. Said his party would join. UK - Jacob Rees-Mogg: Pro-Brexit conservative parliamentarian. Said he has no interest. FRANCE - Marine Le Pen: Leader of France’s far-right National Rally. Met with Bannon but distanced herself. GERMANY - Alice Weidel: Cofounder of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Called the project “exciting” but then backed away. HUNGARY - Viktor Orbán: Prime minister and leader of the nationalist Fidesz party. Praised the idea but hasn’t committed. SPAIN - Santiago Abascal: Leader of Spain’s ultraconservative VOX party. Said to count his party in. CZECH REPUBLIC - Milos Zeman: President of the Republic. Said “I absolutely disagree with his views.” NETHERLANDS - Geert Wilders: Parliamentary leader of the anti-Islam Party for Freedom. Likes Bannon but hasn’t joined. On March 4, 2018, Five Star participated in its second national election. This time, Nugnes, the architect turned parliamentarian, watched the coverage on TV alongside activists and representatives in a hotel in central Naples. Unlike in 2013, everyone knew Five Star would do well. But the final results were nevertheless stunning—with 33 percent of the vote, and after just five years in parliament, Five Star had become the largest party in Italy. While her colleagues celebrated, Nugnes worried. “I just saw right away that the overall picture was very disquieting,” she says. Right-wing parties—particularly Lega—had performed well too, off the back of a fiercely anti-immigrant campaign. Nugnes watched uneasily as Five Star tried to form a government, seeming to go against the movement’s original “no alliances” principle. From the start, it was clear that Di Maio—who had criticized the previous, centrist government for presiding over a corrupt, NGO-run “sea taxi” service for migrants to Italy—favored a deal with Lega. Nugnes, who had made a name during the previous five years as an outspoken senator, wrote a scathing post on Facebook about the prospect of an alliance with “he who wants to end immigration,” referring to Lega’s leader, Salvini. “I wouldn’t get into the same elevator,” she went on, “or breathe the same air.” After nearly 90 days of talks, Five Star and Lega came to an agreement; Di Maio and Salvini would share power as deputy prime ministers. When the agreement went up for a vote before Five Star’s members via Rousseau, an astounding 94 percent approved the deal. Movement heavyweights insist that the agreement isn’t an alliance. “If it were an alliance, it would be completely different,” Fico says, explaining that the two parties had instead arrived at a “contract” on a specific program of legislation—a contract that included, crucially, Five Star’s cherished plan for a universal basic income. The new Italian government was hailed by populists around the world. “What is happening here is extraordinary. There has never been a truly populist government in modern times,” Bannon told La Repubblica. “I want to be a part of it.” Bannon gloated that he had advised Salvini to make the deal with Five Star, and he claimed that he had advised Five Star as well. A source close to Bannon confirmed to WIRED that when he was in Rome in June, Bannon met with Davide Casaleggio. Days after the new government took power, Salvini—assuming a dual role as both interior minister and deputy PM—closed Italy’s ports to migrant rescue boats and proposed a census of the country’s Roma community ahead of possible expulsions. Some four months later, Five Star’s universal basic income was approved by Parliament in the government’s annual budget. Di Maio promptly took to the balcony of the parliamentary palace to punch the air in celebration. “We’re going to end up with machines replacing many of today’s jobs,” he tells me later, echoing a common argument in Silicon Valley. “The basic income can be a tool not just to help struggling families but one that allows us to face the fourth industrial revolution.” “If they expel me, it will mean that this is no longer the right place for me,” says Paola Nugnes, a left-wing Five Star senator. “There are so many like me in the movement.” The EU has denounced Italy’s universal basic income as profligate. The country’s public debt stands at 2.3 trillion euros, or 130 percent of the country’s GDP, which far exceeds EU limits; authorities in Brussels fear that Italy’s spendthrift budget will cause the country to default on its loans. Salvini quickly seized on Europe’s rejection of the policy to drum up anti-EU support. As his rants against immigration and the EU continue, Lega is soaring past Five Star in opinion polls. Di Maio has done little to push back against the government’s rightward turn, even as the rebels in his party are growing more defiant. Nugnes and Fattori have both courted expulsion from Five Star over the past year, after refusing to vote with the party at times. They have been subjects of internal investigation, severe criticism by Di Maio, and storms of online abuse. “If they expel me, it will mean that this is no longer the right place for me,” Nugnes says. But she adds: “There are so many like me in the movement. No one can know the future of the movement.” Many believe that the future of the movement is Alessandro Di Battista. The popular former MP decided not to run for election in 2018, despite being omnipresent during the campaign; he says he wanted to get back to the “real world” outside Parliament for a while. Insiders speculate that the real aim of his political hiatus is to avoid hitting his mandatory two-term limit. Once his ally Di Maio’s time is up, many figure, Di Battista will take over the party’s leadership. Of all the movement’s leaders, Di Battista is Five Star’s unabashed Casaleggian radical. On a scratchy WhatsApp line from Guatemala, where he has passed much of his time out of power, Di Battista comes out swinging when I ask about Five Star’s apparent rightward slide: “Today, whoever wants to take back sovereignty is considered a fascist, a nationalist, a populist, a demagogue,” he says. Such allegations, he says, are just another case of media elites missing the point. “The world can’t be judged from an attic in Manhattan. They don’t understand anything—just as they understood nothing of Trump and Brexit, just as they’ve understood nothing about the Five Star Movement.” For Di Battista, Five Star’s grand techno-utopian project is never far from sight. “Representative democracy is obsolete,” he tells me. It will soon be as old hat as absolute monarchy seems to us today. “The future is inevitably direct democracy,” he says. But who knows if that future will be quite as inevitable without a hidden hand to steer it. Darren Loucaides (@DarrenLoucaides) is a British writer who covers politics, populism, and identity.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out in views on race, climate and the role of government By Kim Parker, Nikki Graf and Ruth Igielnik  No longer the new kids on the block, Millennials have moved firmly into their 20s and 30s, and a new generation is coming into focus. Generation Z – diverse and on track to be the most well-educated generation yet – is moving toward adulthood with a liberal set of attitudes and an openness to emerging social trends. On a range of issues, from Donald Trump’s presidency to the role of government to racial equality and climate change, the views of Gen Z – those ages 13 to 21 in 2018 – mirror those of Millennials.1 In each of these realms, the two younger generations hold views that differ significantly from those of their older counterparts. In most cases, members of the Silent Generation are at the opposite end, and Baby Boomers and Gen Xers fall in between.2 It’s too early to say with certainty how the views of this new generation will evolve. Most have yet to reach voting age, and their outlook could be altered considerably by changing national conditions, world events or technological innovations. Even so, two new Pew Research Center surveys, one of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 and one of adults ages 18 and older, provide some compelling clues about where they may be headed and how their views could impact the nation’s political landscape. Only about three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials (30% and 29%, respectively) approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president. This compares with 38% of Gen Xers, 43% of Boomers and 54% of Silents. Similarly, while majorities in Gen Z and the Millennial generation say government should do more to solve problems, rather than that government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals, Gen Xers and Boomers are more evenly divided on this issue. For their part, most Silents would like to see a less activist government. When it comes to views on race, the two younger generations are more likely than older generations to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the United States today. And they are much more likely than their elders to approve of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a sign of protest. The younger generations are also more accepting of some of the ways in which American society is changing. Majorities among Gen Z and the Millennial generation say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society, while older generations are less convinced of this. And they’re more likely to have a positive view of interracial and same-sex marriage than their older counterparts. As a recent Pew Research Center report highlighted, Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation we have seen, but this isn’t all that’s driving the attitudes of this generation when it comes to issues surrounding race and diversity. There are significant, if more modest, generational differences on these issues even among non-Hispanic whites. While Generation Z’s views resemble those of Millennials in many areas, Gen Zers are distinct from Millennials and older generations in at least two ways, both of which reflect the cultural context in which they are coming of age. Gen Zers are more likely than Millennials to say they know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns to refer to them: 35% say this is the case, compared with a quarter of Millennials. Among each older generation, the share saying this drops: 16% of Gen Xers, 12% of Boomers and just 7% of Silents say this. The youngest generation is also the most likely to say forms or online profiles that ask about a person’s gender should include options other than “man” or “woman.” Roughly six-in-ten Gen Zers (59%) hold this view, compared with half of Millennials and four-in-ten or fewer Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. These findings seem to speak more to exposure than to viewpoint, as roughly equal shares of Gen Zers and Millennials say society should be more accepting of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman. Members of Gen Z also stand out somewhat in their views on the role social media plays in modern news consumption. These teens and young adults are much less likely than older generations to say the fact that more people are getting their news from social media is a bad thing for society – 39% of Gen Zers hold this view, compared with about half among each of the older generations. While they are young and their political views may not be fully formed, there are signs that those in Generation Z who identify as Republican or lean to the Republican Party diverge somewhat from older Republicans – even Millennials – in their views on several key issues. These same generational divides are not as apparent among Democrats. On views about race relations, Gen Z Republicans are more likely than older generations of Republicans to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites. Among Republicans, 43% of Gen Zers say this, compared with 30% of Millennials and roughly 20% of Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Z Republicans are also much more likely than their GOP counterparts in older generations to say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society. On each of these measures, Democrats’ views are nearly uniform across generations. In addition, the youngest Republicans stand apart in their views on the role of government and the causes of climate change. Gen Z Republicans are much more likely than Republicans in older generations to say government should do more to solve problems. And they are less likely than their older counterparts to attribute the earth’s warming temperatures to natural patterns, as opposed to human activity. While younger and older Americans differ in many of their views, there are some areas where generation is not as clearly linked with attitudes. When it comes to the merits of having more women running for political office, majorities across generations say this is a good thing for the country. Majorities in each generation also say that, on balance, legal immigrants have had a positive impact on the U.S. This analysis is based on a survey of 920 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 conducted online Sept. 17-Nov. 25, 2018, combined with a nationally representative survey of 10,682 adults ages 18 and older conducted online Sept. 24-Oct. 7, 2018, using Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.3 Findings based on Generation Z combine data from the teens survey with data from the 18- to 21-year-old respondents in the adult survey. When it comes to views on political issues and the current political climate, younger generations have consistently held more liberal views than older generations in recent years. Today, members of Generation Z hold many similar views to Millennials, and both tend to be more liberal than older generations. Seven-in-ten Gen Zers say the government should do more to solve problems in this country, while just 29% say the government is doing too many things that are better left to individuals and businesses. Gen Zers are slightly more likely to favor government activism than Millennials, and significantly more likely than older generations: 53% of Gen Xers, 49% of Baby Boomers and 39% of Silents favor government involvement over businesses and individuals. Among Republicans and those who lean to the Republican Party, the generational divides are even starker. Roughly half (52%) of Gen Z Republicans say they think the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 38% of Millennial Republicans and 29% of Gen Xers. About a quarter of Republican Baby Boomers (23%) and fewer GOP Silents (12%) believe the government should be doing more. Among Democrats, however, these generational divides largely disappear. Roughly eight-in-ten Gen Z (81%) and Millennial Democrats (79%) say the government should do more to solve problems, as do about seven-in-ten Democratic Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Zers’ views about climate change are virtually identical to those of Millennials and not markedly different from Gen Xers. About half in all three generations say the earth is getting warmer due to human activity. Boomers are somewhat more skeptical of this than Gen Zers or Millennials. Members of the Silent Generation are least likely to say this (38%) and are more likely to say the earth is warming mainly due to natural patterns (28%) than are Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers. Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out from older generations as the least likely to say the earth is warming because of natural patterns – 18% say this. By comparison, 30% of Millennial, 36% of Gen X and roughly four-in-ten Boomer (42%) and Silent Generation Republicans (41%) say the same. Almost no generation gap exists among Democrats in views on this issue. When it comes to views of Donald Trump, there are sizable generational divides, particularly among Republicans. Nine-in-ten Republicans in the Silent Generation approve of the job the president is doing, as do 85% of Baby Boomer Republicans and 76% of Gen X Republicans; smaller majorities of GOP Millennials (65%) and Gen Zers (59%) think he’s doing a good job. Younger generations also have a different view of the U.S. relative to other countries in the world. While pluralities of nearly all generations (with the exception of the Silent Generation) say the U.S. is one of the best countries in the world along with some others, Gen Zers and Millennials are the least likely to say the U.S. is better than all other countries. Only 14% and 13%, respectively, hold this view, compared with one-in-five Gen Xers, 30% of Boomers and 45% of Silents. Roughly three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials say there are other countries that are better than the U.S. In their views about the general direction of the country, Gen Zers are mostly downbeat, but they’re not alone in that assessment. Among Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers, two-thirds or more say things in this country are generally going in the wrong direction. About six-in-ten Boomers (61%) say the same. Members of the Silent Generation have a less negative view (53% say things are going in the wrong direction). Today’s 13- to 21-year-olds are only slightly more likely than Millennials to say ordinary citizens can do a lot to influence the government in Washington (53% of Gen Zers say this vs. 46% of Millennials). And their views on this issue don’t differ much from those of Gen Xers, Boomers or Silents (50%, 58% and 58%, respectively, say citizens can have a lot of influence on the government). Younger generations have a different perspective than their older counterparts on the treatment of blacks in the United States. Two-thirds of Gen Z (66%) and 62% of Millennials say blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the U.S. Fewer Gen Xers (53%), Boomers (49%) and Silents (44%) say this. Roughly half of Silents (44%) say both races are treated about equally, compared with just 28% among Gen Z. The patterns are similar after controlling for race: Younger generations of white Americans are far more likely than whites in older generations to say blacks are not receiving fair treatment. Younger generations also have a different viewpoint on the issue of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a protest. Majorities among Gen Z (61%) and the Millennial generation (62%) approve of the protests. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (44%) and Baby Boomers (37%) favor these actions. Members of the Silent Generation disapprove of the protests by a more than two-to-one margin (68% disapprove, 29% approve). Gen Zers and Millennials share similar views about racial and ethnic change in the country. Roughly six-in-ten from each generation say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (52% say this is a good thing), and older generations are even less likely to view this positively. Younger Republicans again stand out in this regard. Half of Gen Z Republicans (51%) say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for the country. This compares with 38% of Millennial, 34% of Gen X, 30% of Boomer and 28% of Silent Generation Republicans. Among Democrats, there is widespread agreement across generations. Though they differ in their views over the changing racial and ethnic makeup of the country, across generations most Americans agree about the impact that legal immigrants have on society. On balance, all generations see legal immigration as more positive than negative. Across most generations, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say legal immigrants are having a positive impact. However, within Gen Z there is no partisan gap on this issue. When it comes to views about how careful people should be in using potentially offensive language, members of Gen Z are divided over whether people need to be more careful or if concerns about political correctness have gone too far. Some 46% of Gen Zers say people need to be more careful about the language they use to avoid offending people with different backgrounds, while 53% say too many people are easily offended these days over the language that others use. Gen Zers’ views are only modestly different from those of Millennials and Gen Xers on this topic: 39% and 38%, respectively, say people need to be more careful about the language they use, while about six-in-ten say people are too easily offended these days. Interestingly, members of the Silent Generation are closer to members of Gen Z in their views on this topic than they are to Boomers, Gen Xers or Millennials. Since they first entered adulthood, Millennials have been at the leading edge of changing views on same-sex marriage. In 2014, when a narrow majority of all adults (52%) said they favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, 67% of Millennials held that view. Today, members of Generation Z are just as likely as Millennials to say allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry has been a good thing for the country (48% of Gen Zers and 47% of Millennials hold this view). One-third of Gen Xers say this is a good thing for the country, as do 27% of Baby Boomers. Members of the Silent Generation are the least enthusiastic (18% say this is a good thing). Relatively few Gen Zers or Millennials (15%) say same-sex marriage is a bad thing for society. Boomers and Silents are much more likely to view this change negatively (32% and 43%, respectively, say this is a bad thing). Across generations, about four-in-ten say allowing gays and lesbians to marry hasn’t made much of a difference for the U.S. In other ways, too, Gen Zers and Millennials are similar in their openness to changes that are affecting the institutions of marriage and family. Roughly half (53%) from each generation say interracial marriage is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (41% say this is a good thing), and older generations are much less likely to view interracial marriage positively. Relatively few across generations say this trend is bad for society; majorities of Silents (66%) and Boomers (60%) say it doesn’t make much difference, as do 53% of Xers. When it comes to couples living together without being married, roughly two-thirds of each generation (with the exception of Silents) say this doesn’t make much of a difference for society. About one-in-five Gen Zers and Millennials say cohabitation is a good thing for society – higher than the shares for older generations. Fully 41% of Silents say this is bad thing for the country, as do about a quarter of Boomers. Compared with their views on cohabitation, the youngest generations have a more negative assessment of the impact of single women raising children: 35% among Gen Z and 36% of Millennials say this is a bad thing for society; roughly four-in-ten Gen Xers and Boomers and 48% of Silents say the same. About half of Gen Zers and Millennials say this doesn’t make much difference for society, while relatively few (15%) view it as a good thing. In their views about gender roles within couples, members of Generation Z are virtually identical to Millennials and Gen Xers and quite similar to Baby Boomers. Large majorities in all four groups say that, in households with a mother and a father, the responsibility for providing for the family financially should be shared equally. About one-in-five Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers – and a quarter of Boomers – say this responsibility should fall primarily on the fathers. Very few say mothers should be mostly responsible for this. Silents are the outliers on this issue: 40% say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for their families financially, while 58% say this responsibility should be shared between mothers and fathers. For the most part, there are no notable gender gaps in views on this issue; the Silent Generation is the exception. Among Gen Zers, Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers, male and female respondents are largely in agreement that mothers and fathers should share family financial responsibility. Among members of the Silent Generation, roughly half of men (49%) but 33% of women say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for the family financially. Large majorities (84% or more) across generations say that responsibility for taking care of children should be shared by mothers and fathers in households with two parents. Some 13% among Gen Z say this responsibility should fall mainly to mothers; similar shares of each of the other generations say the same. Very few say raising children should fall mostly to dads. Male and female respondents across generations have similar views on this issue. A majority of Americans, regardless of generation, view the increasing number of women running for public office as a positive change for our society. Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers say this is a good thing, as do 61% of Boomers and 55% of Silents. About four-in-ten in the Silent Generation (39%) say this trend doesn’t make much difference for society, somewhat higher than the share among the three youngest generations (roughly three-in-ten). There are significant gender gaps on this question, with female respondents expressing much more enthusiasm about the growing number of women running for office in each generation except the Silents. Among Gen Zers, 76% of young women, versus 57% of young men, say the fact that more women are running for office is a good thing for society. The pattern is similar for Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers. However, among Silents, roughly equal shares of men (57%) and women (54%) say this is a good thing. The recognition of people who don’t identify as a man or a woman has garnered increased attention amid changing laws concerning gender options on official documents and growing usage of gender-neutral pronouns. There are stark generational differences in views on these issues. Generation Z is the most likely of the five generations to say that when a form or online profile asks about a person’s gender it should include options other than “man” and “woman”; a 59% majority of Gen Zers say this. Half of Millennials say forms or online profiles should include additional gender options, as do about four-in-ten Gen Xers (40%) and Boomers (37%) and roughly a third of those in the Silent Generation (32%). These views vary widely along partisan lines, with generational differences evident within each party coalition, but sharpest among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. About four-in-ten Republican Gen Zers (41%) think forms should include other gender options, compared with 27% of Republican Millennials, 17% of GOP Gen Xers and Boomers and 16% of Republican Silents. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, half or more in all generations say this, including 71% of Gen Zers and 55% of Silents. When it comes to how accepting society in general is of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman, the views of Gen Zers and Millennials differ from those of older generations. Roughly half of Gen Zers (50%) and Millennials (47%) think that society is not accepting enough. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (39%), Boomers (36%) and those in the Silent Generation (32%) say the same. A plurality of the Silent Generation (41%) say society is too accepting of people who don’t identify as a man or woman. Across all generations, roughly a quarter say society’s acceptance level is about right. Again, there are large partisan gaps on this question, and Gen Z Republicans stand apart to some extent from other generations of Republicans in their views. Among Republicans, about three-in-ten Gen Zers (28%) say that society is not accepting enough of people who don’t identify as a man or woman, compared with 20% of Millennials, 15% of Gen Xers, 13% of Boomers and 11% of Silents. Democrats vary little by generation in shares holding this view. Gen Zers and Millennials are much more familiar than their elders with the idea that some people may prefer gender-neutral pronouns: 74% of Gen Zers and 69% of Millennials say they have heard “a lot” or “a little” about people preferring that others use gender-neutral pronouns such as “they” instead of “he” or “she” when referring to them, with about three-in-ten saying they have heard a lot about this. Most Gen Xers (62%) also have heard a lot or a little about people preferring gender-neutral pronouns. There is less awareness of this among older generations. Still, half of Boomers and 45% of Silents say they have heard at least a little about gender-neutral pronouns. Gen Zers are also the most likely among the five generations to say they personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns, with 35% saying so, compared with 25% of Millennials. Each of these younger generations is more likely than Gen Xers (16%), Boomers (12%) and Silents (7%) to say they personally know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns when referring to them. This generational pattern is evident among both Democrats and Republicans. In addition to their greater familiarity with gender-neutral pronouns, Gen Zers and Millennials express somewhat higher levels of comfort with using gender-neutral pronouns, though generational differences on this question are more modest. Majorities of Gen Zers (57%) and Millennials (59%) say they would feel “very” or “somewhat” comfortable using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so, including about three-in-ten (32% of Gen Zers, 31% of Millennials) who say they would be very comfortable doing this. By comparison, Gen Xers and Boomers are evenly divided: About as many say they would feel at least somewhat comfortable (49% and 50%, respectively) as say they would be uncomfortable. Silents are the only group in which more say they would feel uncomfortable (59%) than say they would feel comfortable (39%) using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone. There are wide party gaps on this measure across generations. Within each generation, Democrats come down on the side of feeling comfortable, rather than uncomfortable, using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so. In contrast, for each generation of Republicans, majorities say they would feel uncomfortable doing this. Across generations, knowing someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns is linked to comfort levels in using these pronouns. Three-quarters of Millennials and about two-thirds of Gen Zers, Gen Xers and Boomers who personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns say they would feel very or somewhat comfortable referring to someone with a gender-neutral pronoun. Those who don’t know someone are roughly 20 percentage points less likely to say the same (51% of Gen Zers, 54% of Millennials, 46% of Gen Xers and 48% of Boomers who don’t know someone say this).4 Fact Tank01/17/2019 Fact Tank11/28/2018 Fact Tank09/06/2018 Social Trends01/17/2019 U.S. Politics01/18/2019 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-419-4349 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

The Supreme Court will decide whether the 2020 census can include a question about citizenship, ensuring a quick review of a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from doing so. Trump says the courts will decide the constitutionality of the national emergency. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is participating in a private conference with other justices Friday after missing several high-court meetings and dates for health reasons. Critics of the Amazon plan can rejoice in their success in having prevented economic development in a moribund area of western Queens. They have preserved stagnation and called it progress. As Washington, D.C. debates a budget deal that would get President Trump barely 1/20th of the border wall funding he requested, and with significant strings attached, two local Texas lawmakers are proposing dipping into the state’s "rainy day" fund to finance the border barrier on their own. When Ohio legislators first passed the heartbeat bill, which would make abortions illegal once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, it was dead on arrival to former Gov. John Kasich's veto pen in December. Former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, in his final days in office, pardoned a wealthy “career drunk driver” in an effort to help the man seek a lucrative promotion, a move branded by Snyder's critics as a mockery of justice.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-census-citizenship-question_n_5c634dd7e4b03de94296978b---split---The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would hear an expedited appeal in a case seeking to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The justices’ decision to take up the case of Department of Commerce v. New York was largely expected and marks the latest step in a closely watched legal battle over next year’s census. Critics contend that adding the citizenship question would discourage people, particularly people of color, from responding to the survey. An inaccurate census would have drastic consequences, they warn, because its results are used to allocate congressional seats and hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds. In January, a federal judge in Manhattan blocked the Trump administration from adding the question. Normally, the case would then go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit before heading to the Supreme Court. But with the Census Bureau facing a fast-approaching June deadline for finalizing census questions, the high court has agreed to hear argument in the appeal in late April. Both the plaintiffs in the suit ― 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant rights groups ― and the Trump administration argued in court filings that if the justices were going to take the case, they should do so quickly and bypass the 2nd Circuit. In a 277-page opinion last month, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman held that the way the Trump administration added the question ran afoul of a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. He found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had ignored analyses from experts on how damaging the question would be and cherry-picked evidence to support his desire to add the question. Ross publicly claimed that he began considering the question only after the Justice Department requested it and that the Justice Department wanted the question in order to obtain better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. But Furman, who was appointed to the federal bench by then-President Barack Obama, said the voting rights rationale was “pretextual,” a “sham justification” concealing the true reason for Ross’ decision. The decennial census ― which goes out to every American household ― hasn’t asked about citizenship since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. And a top Justice Department official was unable to explain in a sworn deposition how adding the citizenship question would get the department better citizenship data than it already had available. In total, seven different lawsuits have been filed challenging the addition of the citizenship question. This story has been updated to note that the Supreme Court will hear argument in the case in late April. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-national-emergency-n957711---split---President Donald Trump on Friday declared a "national emergency" to pay for his wall on the southern border. Presidents have long had broad discretion to declare national emergencies and can tap into an array of emergency powers when they do. While those emergency powers aren't spelled out in the Constitution, legal scholars say the president is entitled to them under the broadly defined "executive power." Abraham Lincoln used the power to suspend habeas corpus during the Civil War, while Franklin Roosevelt used it to order the internment of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II. Congress set out to limit the power after the Watergate scandal with the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The act scaled back the provisions of federal law that granted emergency authority to the president — then about 470 — and was intended to give lawmakers a way to check presidential power. An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal law and public policy institute, at New York University's School of Law identified 136 statutory powers that emergency declarations could give the president, covering everything from the military and land use to public health and agriculture. The president could, for example, take over or shut down radio stations or even "suspend a law that prohibits the testing of chemical and biological weapons on unwitting human subjects," the analysis says. In the case of Trump's border wall, the president is relying on Section 2808 of the Title 10 U.S. Code. It says if the president declares a national emergency "that requires use of the armed forces," the defense secretary "may undertake military construction projects ... not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces." Theoretically, but not likely. The National Emergencies Act originally held that Congress could repeal a presidential emergency declaration with a simple majority vote in both houses, but that was later amended because of a 1983 Supreme Court ruling involving separation of powers. As a result, both houses of Congress would have to act with a veto-proof supermajority, according to some experts. That's highly unlikely, since the current divided Congress has had problems even keeping the government open. Possibly. Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said on MSNBC'S "The Rachel Maddow Show" that such a measure would "be subject to a court challenge very quickly." Trump acknowledged to reporters at the White House on Friday that his declaration will be challenged in the courts and that the case would likely wind up at the Supreme Court, where he predicted victory. But experts have noted the legal process could take a long time, and there's a likelihood any wall construction would be put on hold until the court case was concluded. Yes, many times. Since the 1976 law was enacted, presidents declared national emergencies 58 times, but never to fund a stalled policy goal. Republicans and Democrats say doing so could lead down a slippery slope. Yes, three times. He most recently used the National Emergencies Act in November of last year to slap sanctions on high-ranking members of the Nicaraguan government. Trump also signed an order in 2017 targeting 13 foreign nationals accused of human rights abuses and corruption, and another last year authorizing sanctions against foreign nationals who have engaged in interference in U.S. elections. Yes, but not in decades. President Harry Truman tried to use emergency powers to nationalize the steel industry during the Korean War in 1952 over objections from Congress. Truman maintained that "the president has the power to keep the country from going to hell." The bid was blocked by the Supreme Court, which found in a 6-3 ruling that Truman had exceeded his authority. Thirty-one national emergencies are still ongoing, with the longest-running one involving sanctions on Iran in 1979 over the hostage crisis, according to the Brennan Center. Other ongoing presidential emergencies include one from Bill Clinton in 1995 "prohibiting transactions with terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process," and George W. Bush’s broader post-9/11 order authorizing the government to impede terrorist funding. The president needs to renew national emergencies annually.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-issues-gag-order-roger-stone-case-n972216---split---A federal judge issued a gag order in the Roger Stone case Friday, saying attorneys and witnesses for the former Trump campaign adviser and prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller may not speak publicly about Stone's prosecution for lying, witness tampering and obstruction. Judge Amy Berman Jackson also put an end to Stone's courthouse press conferences. The judge ordered that "all interested participants in the matter ... must refrain, when they are entering or exiting the courthouse, or they are within the immediate vicinity of the courthouse, from making statements to the media or to the public that pose a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to this case or are intended to influence any juror, potential juror, judge, witness or court officer or interfere with the administration of justice." Stone's lawyer Grant Smith said: "As you can see in the order, Roger Stone is not in any way 'gagged' and the courthouse steps is a reasonable place for everyone to act with restraint and decorum." Stone was arrested by FBI agents on Jan. 25 during a pre-dawn raid of his Florida home. He has been indicted on seven counts arising from Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, including five counts of making false statements, one count of obstruction and one count of witness tampering. Prosecutors say Stone, a long-time Trump associate who worked for Trump's nascent campaign in 2015, provided the campaign with information about potential releases of hacked emails by WikiLeaks in 2016. In a statement, Stone attorney Grant Smith said, "As you can see in the order, Roger Stone is not in any way 'gagged' and the courthouse steps is a reasonable place for everyone to act with restraint and decorum."

But declaring a national emergency isn’t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed off on declaring a national emergency on Friday to free up funding to construct a wall along the southern border. The move has created a new fight between the White House and lawmakers but will allow up to $8.1 billion to be used to construct a barrier along the bother between the U.S. and Mexico. Here's the full text of the proclamation released by the White House: The current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics. The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border is long-standing, and despite the executive branch's exercise of existing statutory authorities, the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years. In particular, recent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending. If not detained, such aliens are often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to locate. In response to the directive in my April 4, 2018, memorandum and subsequent requests for support by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense has provided support and resources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern border. Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense in the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government's response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. I hereby direct as follows: Section 1. The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Ready Reserve to active duty as the Secretary concerned, in the Secretary's discretion, determines to be appropriate to assist and support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security at the southern border. Sec. 2. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and, subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, shall take all appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law, to use or support the use of the authorities herein invoked, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border lands. Sec. 3. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.

Vote for your favorite joke at usatoday.com/opinion. Eileen Rivers, USA TODAY Opinion President Donald Trump finally did what he's been warning the nation he might. This morning he declared a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico. Since Congress isn't giving Trump the money he wants to build a border wall, his plan is to use the declaration to take money from some other pot. That plan might work, but the logic isn't sound, says late-night comic Trevor Noah. Why? Aren't emergencies generally more pressing than Trump's ongoing case for a border wall? Take a look at today's Best of Late Night, above, to hear Noah's argument that this is all a bit too weird. And Seth Meyers compares Trump to an odd McDonald's complainer.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/supreme-court-will-decide-census-citizenship-question---split---The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the citizenship question case the second week of April. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The Supreme Court will decide by the end of June whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a quick schedule so questionnaires can be printed on time. In a one-line order Friday, the justices agreed to hear oral arguments in the case the second week of April. The Justice Department asked for the rapid review because the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June, which is also when the Supreme Court term ends. The high court’s decision ultimately could affect congressional delegations and appropriations. The census is used to determine the total population of the United States, regardless of immigration status, to fairly distribute federal funds to states and localities, and to reapportion congressional seats and districts, among other things. A federal judge in New York this month stopped Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from adding the question to the census, ruling that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court action Friday means the dispute leapfrogs over the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. The Trump administration argued in a petition that Ross followed the proper decision-making process to add the question, which has been used in previous censuses. Challengers argued that the question would deter immigrants from participating and ultimately benefit Republicans. The American Civil Liberties Union said the lower court found that a citizenship question would stop about 6.5 million people from participating. That would cause California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, New York and Illinois to face a “certainly impending” or “substantial risk of losing a seat” in Congress and numerous states to “lose funds from several federal programs.” Also watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Bill Weld told an audience in New Hampshire that he is launching a 2020 exploratory committee. Charles Krupa/AP hide caption Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld told an audience in New Hampshire that he is launching a 2020 exploratory committee. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said Friday he is thinking about challenging President Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. Weld, a moderate Republican, was twice elected governor. He supports abortion rights and was an early proponent of gay rights. He resigned his post as governor after being offered the ambassadorship to Mexico, but the nomination stalled in the Senate after opposition from other Republicans. Weld then ran as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 2016 on a ticket with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. According to The Washington Post, Weld told the Politics & Eggs breakfast in Bedford, N.H., on Friday that Trump "acts like a schoolyard bully" and that Republicans in Washington who support him "exhibit all the symptoms of Stockholm syndrome." "We don't need six more years of the antics we have seen," Weld said. Weld faces an uphill battle in taking on Trump, who remains popular with Republican voters. He also isn't the only Republican who has mused about challenging the president. But a primary challenge, even if unsuccessful, could conceivably weaken Trump, as past primary challenges hurt George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford, both of whom fought primary opponents before losing the general election for another term. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Abigail Geiger, Kristen Bialik and John Gramlich The 116th U.S. Congress took office in January, with Democrats taking control of the House while Republicans maintain an edge in the Senate. Apart from its political makeup, the new Congress differs from prior ones in other ways, including its demographics. Here are six charts that show how Congress has changed over time, using historical data from CQ Roll Call, the Brookings Institution, the Congressional Research Service and other sources. 1The current Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nonwhites – including blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – now account for 22% of Congress, including a quarter of the House and 9% of the Senate. By comparison, when the 79th Congress took office in 1945, nonwhites represented just 1% of the House and Senate. Despite this growing racial and ethnic diversity, Congress still lags the nation as a whole: The share of nonwhites in the United States is nearly double that of the country’s legislative body (39% vs. 22%). Read More → Topics: Congress, Federal Government, Demographics By John Gramlich and Kat Devlin A growing share of people around the world see U.S. power and influence as a “major threat” to their country, and these views are linked with attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the United States as a whole, according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 22 nations since 2013. A median of 45% across the surveyed nations see U.S. power and influence as a major threat, up from 38% in the same countries during Trump’s first year as president in 2017 and 25% in 2013, during the administration of Barack Obama. The long-term increase in the share of people who see American power as a threat has occurred alongside declines in the shares of people who say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs and who have a favorable view of the United States. (For more about global views toward the U.S. president and the country he leads, see “Trump’s International Ratings Remain Low, Especially Among Key Allies.”) Despite these changes, U.S. power and influence still ranks below other perceived threats around the world. Considerably larger shares of people point to global climate change (seen as a major threat by a median of 67%), the Islamic militant group known as ISIS (cited by 62%) and cyberattacks (cited by 61%). U.S. power and influence, in fact, is not seen as the top threat in any of the countries surveyed. Read More → Topics: U.S. Global Image and Anti-Americanism, Country Image, Donald Trump By Abigail Geiger and Gretchen Livingston The landscape of relationships in America has shifted dramatically in recent decades. From cohabitation to same-sex marriage to interracial and interethnic marriage, here are eight facts about love and marriage in the United States. 1Half of Americans ages 18 and older were married in 2017, a share that has remained relatively stable in recent years but is down 8 percentage points since 1990. One factor driving this change is that Americans are staying single longer. The median age at first marriage had reached its highest point on record: 30 years for men and 28 years for women in 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As the U.S. marriage rate has declined, divorce rates have increased among older Americans. In 2015, for every 1,000 married adults ages 50 and older, 10 had divorced – up from five in 1990. Among those ages 65 and older, the divorce rate roughly tripled since 1990. Read More → Category: 5 Facts Topics: Lifestyle, Family and Relationships, Marriage and Divorce By Aaron Smith Algorithms are all around us, using massive stores of data and complex analytics to make decisions with often significant impacts on humans – from choosing the content people see on social media to judging whether a person is a good credit risk or job candidate. Pew Research Center released several reports in 2018 that explored the role and meaning of algorithms in people’s lives today. Here are some of the key themes that emerged from that research. 1Algorithmically generated content platforms play a prominent role in Americans’ information diets. Sizable shares of U.S. adults now get news on sites like Facebook or YouTube that use algorithms to curate the content they show to their users. A study by the Center found that 81% of YouTube users say they at least occasionally watch the videos suggested by the platform’s recommendation algorithm, and that these recommendations encourage users to watch progressively longer content as they click through the videos suggested by the site. 2The inner workings of even the most common algorithms can be confusing to users. Facebook is among the most popular social media platforms, but roughly half of Facebook users – including six-in-ten users ages 50 and older – say they do not understand how the site’s algorithmically generated news feed selects which posts to show them. And around three-quarters of Facebook users are not aware that the site automatically estimates their interests and preferences based on their online behaviors in order to deliver them targeted advertisements and other content.

These attitudes were evident in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the summer of 2018. Nigeria is home to the largest population in Africa, which is almost evenly split between Muslims and Christians. Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be running against multiple candidates including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), John Gbor of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Usman Muhammed of the Labour Party (LP) and others. Tensions in the country have grown in the final weeks before elections because of Buhari’s controversial decision to suspend the country’s chief justice. These five charts capture the Nigerian public’s mood about the state of their nation and the differing attitudes of the Muslim and Christian populations. Read More → Topics: International Governments and Institutions, Sub-Saharan Africa, Political Attitudes and Values By Jonathan Evans Germany is the birthplace of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, but since the middle of the 20th century, the country has seen a dramatic shift away from Protestantism – one that has greatly outpaced a decline in the share of Germans who are Catholic. Protestants represented a majority (59%) of Germany’s population in 1950, with Catholics as a sizable minority (37%), according to research by Detlef Pollack and Olaf Müller, scholars of religion and sociology at the University of Münster in Germany. These shares are largely based on church membership rolls that include both children and adults. Over the next 60 years, the share of Protestants fell 30 percentage points, while the share of Catholics dropped 7 points. Each group now includes roughly three-in-ten Germans, based on 2010 membership data. Declines in the shares of Protestants and Catholics have been accompanied by a rising share of the religiously unaffiliated, who accounted for 30% of Germans in 2010, up from fewer than 4% in 1950. And recent research indicates that the share of Muslims in Germany also has been growing in recent years, due in large part to immigration. Read More → Topics: Western Europe, Catholics and Catholicism, Christians and Christianity, Religious Affiliation, Europe By David Masci Tuesday is the 210th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth, a day now celebrated by some as Darwin Day. Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution through natural selection. When Darwin’s work was first made public in 1859, it shocked Britain’s religious establishment. And while today it is accepted by virtually all scientists, evolutionary theory still is rejected by many Americans, often because it conflicts with their religious beliefs about divine creation. While not an official holiday, Darwin Day has been adopted by scientific and humanist groups to promote everything from scientific literacy to secularism. This year, dozens of events have been planned worldwide, many of them anchored by scientific talks or symposiums. To mark the occasion, here are six facts about the public’s views on evolution, as well as other aspects of the debate in the U.S. and elsewhere: 1Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults (81%) say humans have evolved over time, according to data from a new Pew Research Center study. This includes one-third of all Americans (33%) who say that humans evolved due to processes like natural selection with no involvement by God or a higher power, along with 48% who believe human evolution occurred through processes guided or allowed by God or a higher power. The same survey found that 18% of Americans reject evolution entirely, saying humans have always existed in their present form. (See the full report for a deeper look at the ways question wording and format can affect survey results on evolution.) Read More → Category: 5 Facts Topics: Religion and Society, Evolution, Religious Beliefs and Practices, Science and Innovation By Anna Brown A slight majority of Americans (53%) think it is generally unacceptable for a white person to use makeup to darken their skin to appear to be a different race as part of a Halloween costume, including 37% who say this is never acceptable. About one-in-three (34%) say this is always or sometimes acceptable, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. The survey was conducted almost entirely before news broke about Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and other high-profile politicians who have been accused of wearing blackface as part of costumes when they were younger. White adults are about twice as likely as black adults to say the use of blackface as part of a Halloween costume can be acceptable: 39% of whites hold this view vs. 19% of blacks. Hispanics fall in the middle, with 28% saying this is always or sometimes acceptable. Among whites, those younger than 30 are far less accepting of the use of blackface. About a quarter of younger whites (27%) say it is at least sometimes acceptable for a white person to use makeup to darken their skin to appear to be a different race as part of a Halloween costume, but about two-thirds say this is rarely (23%) or never (41%) acceptable. Older whites are more divided, with roughly four-in-ten of those ages 30 and older saying this is acceptable at least sometimes, and about half or fewer in each group saying this is rarely or never acceptable. Acceptance of blackface also is more common among whites without a college degree. While 44% of whites with some college or less education say this is always or sometimes acceptable, 28% of whites with at least a bachelor’s degree say the same. Read More → Topics: Race and Ethnicity By Kristen Bialik More than one-in-five voting members (22%) of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are racial or ethnic minorities, making the 116th Congress the most racially and ethnically diverse in history. There has been a long-running trend toward more racial and ethnic diversity on Capitol Hill: Each of the previous four Congresses broke the record set by the Congress before it. Overall, 116 lawmakers today are nonwhite (including blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans), according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Congressional Research Service. This represents an 84% increase over the 107th Congress of 2001-03, which had 63 minority members. Although recent Congresses have continued to set new highs for racial and ethnic diversity, they have still been disproportionately white when compared with the overall U.S. population. Nonwhites make up 39% of the nation’s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. (For this analysis, Hispanics are included in the Census Bureau estimates for the share of each racial minority group in the overall population.) In the House of Representatives, however, some racial and ethnic groups are now on par with their share of the total population. For example, 12% of House members are black, about equal to the share of Americans who are black. And Native Americans now make up 1% of the House, equal to their 1% of the population. Other nonwhite groups in the House are somewhat less represented relative to their share of the population. The share of Hispanics in the U.S. population (18%) is twice as high as it is in the House (9%). Asians account for 6% of the national population but 3% of House members. The increase in minority representation in the House has largely come among newly elected Democrats. Of the 22 freshman representatives who are nonwhite, just one is a Republican (Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who is Hispanic). Nine senators are a racial or ethnic minority, unchanged from the 115th Congress. Four senators are Hispanic, three are Asian and three are black. (Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is black and Asian). There are no nonwhite freshman senators. In the full 116th Congress, the overwhelming majority of racial and ethnic nonwhite members are Democrats (90%), while just 10% are Republicans. Non-Hispanic whites make up 78% of voting members in the new Congress, considerably larger than their 61% share of the U.S. population overall. And despite the growing racial and ethnic diversity of Congress, this gap has widened over time: In 1981, 94% of Congress was white, compared with 80% of the U.S. population. This analysis includes a few members who are counted under more than one racial or ethnic identity. In addition to Harris, Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., is counted as both black and Asian. Reps. Antonio Delgado and Adriano Espaillat, both New York Democrats, are listed as black and Hispanic. Espaillat, the first Dominican American elected to Congress, self-identifies as a Latino of African descent. Portuguese American members are not included in the Hispanic count. In addition, one disputed seat in the House – North Carolina’s 9th District – is not included in the total number of voting seats.

Today, 63% of U.S. adults say stricter environmental regulations are “worth the cost,” while 30% say such regulations “cost too many jobs and hurt the economy,” according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. Two years ago, the balance of opinion was narrower, as 59% said stricter environmental regulations were worth the cost, while 37% said they cost too many jobs. Partisanship continues to be a major factor in opinions about tougher environmental laws, with Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to view stricter laws and regulations as worth the cost. But since 2017, the share of Republicans who take a positive view of stricter environmental laws has increased, from 36% then to 45% today. There has been little change in Democrats’ views in this period (77% then, 81% now). Still, Republicans remain less supportive of stricter environmental laws and regulations than they were during the 1990s and much of the 2000s. In 2007, for example, 58% of Republicans said they were worth the cost.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/08/border-apprehensions-of-migrant-families-have-risen-substantially-so-far-in-2018/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Kristen Bialik There were nearly 467,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, the most for any calendar year since at least 2012, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the most recent available data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The increase was driven in part by a dramatic spike in border apprehensions of family members at the end of last year. Despite the increase, the number of border apprehensions in 2018 remained far below the levels throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, when around 1 million or more migrants were being apprehended each fiscal year. The situation at the southwest border has become the focus of the now nearly month-long partial federal government shutdown. President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders are at an impasse over Trump’s proposal for a wall at the border. In the months leading up to the shutdown, there was a large increase in the number of people in family units apprehended at the border. Monthly family apprehensions subsequently hit new highs each month from September through December, according to data going back to 2012. There were nearly 17,000 family member apprehensions in September, more than 23,000 in October, about 25,000 in November and a record of more than 27,000 in December. All told, roughly 163,000 family members were apprehended last year – more than three times as many as in 2017, and the highest number since at least 2012.  Family members accounted for about a third (35%) of all border apprehensions in 2018 – the highest share within the past seven years. The months leading up to the shutdown drove this increase: Family member apprehensions in December made up more than half (54%) of total southwest border apprehensions that month, the fourth consecutive high since September (40%). Border agents also apprehended nearly 54,000 unaccompanied children in 2018 – or 12% of the total – though this share was lower than in 2014 through 2016 (each 14%). (Unaccompanied child apprehensions do not include children who were apprehended as a family unit and later became unaccompanied as a result of prosecution initiatives.) Besides unaccompanied children and family members, single adults continue to account for the largest share of border apprehensions: In 2018 there were nearly 250,000 single adult apprehensions, or 54% of the total. Still, the recent surge in family unit apprehensions is particularly notable because December 2018 marks the third time family member apprehensions exceeded single adult apprehensions, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The other two times were in October and November. The apprehension of families and unaccompanied children received renewed attention following the Trump administration’s announcement of a “zero tolerance” policy in April last year. The policy led families to be separated at the border starting in May, though Trump ended the policy in an executive order in late June. Family separations do still occur – such as when adult migrants traveling with children are apprehended at the border and deemed to be involved in criminal or gang activity – though more rarely than under the zero tolerance policy. From June 21 through November, 81 children were separated from 76 adult family members at the border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The vast majority of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors apprehended on the U.S.-Mexico border come from Mexico or the Northern Triangle region (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). (In December 2018, 95% of apprehended family members were from the Northern Triangle.) And in recent years, there have been more overall apprehensions of non-Mexicans than Mexicans at U.S. borders, reflecting a decline in the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. over the past decade. Many families are leaving countries with high levels of violent crime, a fact highlighted in 2017 by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who said “vicious gangs and vast criminal organizations” drive illegal immigration to the U.S. In 2016, El Salvador had the world’s highest murder rate (82.8 homicides per 10,000 people), followed by Honduras (at a rate of 56.5). Guatemala was 10th (at 27.3), according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Poverty represents another motivating force for migration from Central America. Northern Triangle nations are among the poorest in Latin America, and although some have seen a reduction of extreme poverty in recent years, high shares of people still live on less than $2 a day (the international poverty line is $1.90). Within Latin America and the Caribbean, Honduras has the second-highest share (16%) of people below the international poverty line, after Haiti (24%), according to the latest data from the World Bank. Guatemala is fourth-highest at 9%. In El Salvador, 2% of people live below $2 a day. Given the level of poverty in the region, some migrants seek out economic opportunity in the U.S. in hopes of sending money back to their home countries. Most remittance dollars flowing to Latin America come from the U.S., and for Northern Triangle countries in particular, remittances make up a relatively large share of each country’s gross domestic product. In Honduras, for example, remittances were 19% of the nation’s GDP in 2017, according to data from the World Bank. In comparison, remittances were about 3% of Mexico’s GDP last year. For unaccompanied children, family reunification could also be a strong driver. Among children from the Northern Triangle who were apprehended by the U.S. between January 2014 and April 2015, 60% were released to a parent already living in the U.S. Fewer than 10% were released to a non-family sponsor, such as a family friend or a person the family had no previous relationship with, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2019/02/10/climate-change-still-seen-as-the-top-global-threat-but-cyberattacks-a-rising-concern/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Worries about ISIS and North Korea persist, as fears about American power grow By Jacob Poushter and Christine Huang The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report last year expressing serious concerns about the possible impacts of climate change, both in the near and distant future. Broadly speaking, people around the world agree that climate change poses a severe risk to their countries, according to a 26-nation survey conducted in the spring of 2018. In 13 of these countries, people name climate change as the top international threat. But global warming is just one of many concerns. Terrorism, specifically from the Islamic extremist group known as ISIS, and cyberattacks are also seen by many as major security threats. In eight of the countries surveyed, including Russia, France, Indonesia and Nigeria, ISIS is seen as the top threat. In four nations, including Japan and the United States, people see cyberattacks from other countries as their top international concern. One country, Poland, names Russia’s power and influence as its top threat, but few elsewhere say Russia is a major concern.  __ is a major threat to our country Note: “*” indicates the question was not asked in the country. Source: Spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey.  Many people also express fears about North Korea’s nuclear program, but in none of the 26 countries do people rate it as one of their top two concerns (even in neighboring South Korea). Fewer still rate the condition of the global economy as their top international concern, although it remains a pertinent issue in many countries, especially in places where ratings for the national economy are overwhelmingly negative, such as Greece and Brazil. And while a median of less than half across the nations in the survey say the influence of the U.S. is a major threat to their countries, more people now say it is a threat than in 2013 and 2017. Indeed, in 10 countries, roughly half or more now claim that American power is a major threat to their nation – including 64% who say this in Mexico, where ratings for the U.S. have turned sharply negative since the election of President Donald Trump. At the bottom of the threats list is China’s power and influence, although roughly half or more in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and the U.S. name China as a major threat. These are among the findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 27,612 respondents in 26 countries from May 14 to Aug. 12, 2018. There have been substantial changes over time on many of the eight international threats asked about in the 2018 survey. For example, in 2013, well before the Paris climate agreement was signed, a median of 56% across 23 countries surveyed said global climate change was a major threat to their country. That climbed to 63% in 2017, and in 2018 it stands at 67%. Since 2013, worries about the climate threat have increased significantly in 13 of the countries where data are available. The biggest increases have been in France (up 29 percentage points) and Mexico (up 28 points), but there have been double-digit rises in the U.S., UK, Germany, Spain, Kenya, Canada, South Africa and Poland as well. In 2013, a little less than half across the countries surveyed said North Korea’s nuclear program was a major threat (47%). But in 2018, a median of 55% name the issue as a major threat. Worries about the nuclear threat have risen substantially in many countries over the past five years, especially in the countries surveyed across Africa and Latin America. There has also been a substantial jump in those who see cyberattacks from other countries as a top threat. In 2018, a median of 61% across the countries see cyberthreats as a serious concern, up from 54% who said this in 2017. In the past few years there have been multiple headline-grabbing cybersecurity breaches in places as varied as the U.S., Japan and South Africa. Since 2017, there have been double-digit rises in those saying cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to their country in Tunisia (up 25 percentage points), the Netherlands (+15 points), Greece (+12), Sweden (+11) and Canada (+10). Meanwhile, there has been a decrease since 2017 in the number of countries that see ISIS as the top security threat. Substantial double-digit declines among those saying ISIS is a major threat occurred over the past year in Israel (down 16 points), Spain (-13), the U.S. (-12), Greece (-10) and Japan (-10). Views on the global economy and China as major threats have remained roughly the same since 2017. The largest change in sentiment among the global threats tracked are for those who see U.S. power and influence as a major threat to their countries. In 2013, only a quarter across 22 nations saw American power as a major threat to their country, but that jumped substantially to 38% in 2017, the year after Trump was elected president, and to 45% in 2018. In fact, in 18 of the 22 countries surveyed in both 2013, when Barack Obama was the U.S. president, and 2018, there has been a statistically significant increase in those who name the U.S. as a major threat. This includes increases of 30 percentage points in Germany, 29 points in France and 26 points in Brazil and Mexico. There is also a strong connection between seeing America as a threat and lack of confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump. In 17 of the countries surveyed, people who have little or no confidence in the U.S. president are more likely than those who do have confidence in Trump to name U.S. power and influence as a top threat. This difference is most acute among America’s traditional allies, such as Canada, the UK and Australia, where overall views of the U.S. and its president have plummeted in recent years. Across the 10 European countries surveyed, climate change and ISIS are clearly seen as major international threats, although a median of about half or more also name cyberattacks and North Korea’s nuclear program as top concerns. Russia’s power and influence is seen as a major threat by a median of four-in-ten across the continent, about the same share that sees U.S. power and influence as a threat (median of 37%). Meanwhile, only 35% see the condition of the global economy as a major threat, as European countries have mostly recovered from the Great Recession and subsequent euro crisis. A median of 31% see China as a major threat. In terms of individual nations surveyed within Europe, majorities in every country name climate change and ISIS as major threats to their countries. However, six of these countries offer climate change as the top concern, while only two name ISIS. In the Netherlands, more people say cyberattacks from other countries is the top threat, while in Poland, more say Russia’s power and influence is their major international concern. And while few across Europe say the condition of the global economy is a major threat to their country, 88% in Greece do. Despite some rising concerns about American power and influence, no more than half in any European country say U.S. power is a major threat, although nearly half hold this view in France (49%), Germany (49%) and Greece (48%). Since 2013, there has been a significant increase in the share naming climate change a major threat in seven of the European countries surveyed in both years. This includes a 29-percentage-point increase in France, an 18-point increase in the UK, 17 points in Spain and 15 points in Germany. There are some notable differences between American and Canadian views about the top threats facing their countries. Americans are chiefly concerned about cyberattacks, although majorities also see ISIS (62%), climate change (59%) and North Korea’s nuclear program (58%) as major threats. Since 2017, worries about ISIS are down 12 percentage points among Americans. By contrast, more Canadians say global climate change is a major threat to their country than say the same about cyberattacks (57%) or ISIS (54%). Cybersecurity has grown as a concern in Canada since 2017, when fewer than half (47%) said it was a major threat. Russians are relatively untroubled by cyberattacks from other countries (only 36% say it is a major threat) but are concerned about ISIS (62% major threat). Generally, Russians are among the least concerned about all the various threats tested in the survey relative to other countries. On a variety of threats, but especially on climate change and ISIS, there are sharp ideological and partisan divides in Europe and North America. For example, in the U.S., Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party are 56 percentage points less likely to believe that global climate change is a major threat to their country than are Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party. While this partisan divide is substantial, it is not unique. In Europe, supporters of some right-wing populist parties are less concerned than others about climate change. For instance, those with a favorable view of Alternative for Germany (AfD) are 28 percentage points less likely to say that climate change is a major threat to their country than those who do not support that party. Double-digit differences on this issue also appear between supporters and nonsupporters of UKIP in the UK, National Front (now National Rally) in France, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, and the Sweden Democrats in Sweden. There are also strong ideological divides on the threat perceptions of climate change and ISIS across Europe and North America. In nine of the 12 European and North American countries surveyed, those on the ideological left are more concerned about the threat of global climate change than those on the right. This is especially the case in the U.S., where nearly nine-in-ten (87%) among those on the left say global warming is a top concern, versus only 31% on the right who say this. Conversely, those on the political right in Europe and North America are often more concerned about ISIS than are those on the left. This includes ideological differences of more than 20 percentage points in the Netherlands, Canada, the U.S. and Sweden on the ISIS threat. A slight education divide on the threat of climate change exists in many European and North American countries surveyed, where those with more education are more inclined to say it is a threat than those with less education. In contrast to worries about climate change, in eight countries, those with less education are more likely to say ISIS is a major threat than their more-educated counterparts. Women in many countries surveyed are also more concerned about the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program than are men. Overall, double-digit differences between men and women on the North Korean threat appear in nine of the countries surveyed in Europe and North America, with the biggest gap in Sweden. In seven countries, women are more concerned about climate change than are men. In Poland, 61% of women name it as a major threat, compared with 48% of men. Women are also generally more worried than men about the ISIS threat (this is true in 10 countries in North America and Europe). On the risk posed by ISIS, there are significant age divides in many of the countries surveyed. For example, in Germany, 78% of those ages 50 and older are worried about the ISIS threat, compared with only 42% among 18- to 29-year-old Germans. Across the five Asia-Pacific countries surveyed, cyberattacks, climate change and ISIS are all mentioned as top concerns by at least one country. In Japan, it is cyberattacks, while in South Korea and Australia, it is climate change. ISIS is named as the top threat in the Philippines and Indonesia, nations where Islamic extremist violence has occurred frequently over the past 15 years. Asia-Pacific publics also express concern about North Korea’s nuclear program and China’s power and influence. In South Korea, more rate China’s power as a major threat (82%) than the DPRK’s nuclear program (67%). Since 2013, concern about North Korea has fallen substantially in South Korea, from 82% in 2013 to 67% in 2018. Over that time, perceptions of China as a threat have grown in four of the nations surveyed in the region, particularly in Australia (up 20 points) and Indonesia (up 16). Among the three Latin American countries surveyed, global climate change continues to rank as the top concern, extending an established trend. Eight-in-ten Mexicans say climate change is a major threat, marking an 8-percentage-point increase from 2017 and a 28-point increase since the question was first asked in 2013. Almost three-quarters of Argentines (73%) and Brazilians (72%) name climate change as a major threat. Education plays a significant role in how Latin American respondents evaluate the climate change threat. In Brazil, for example, more than eight-in-ten (84%) of those with a secondary education or higher say climate change is a major threat, compared with 62% of those with less education – a 22-point difference. Additionally, 85% of Brazilians in the ideological center are concerned about climate change, versus 74% of those on the left and 69% among the ideological right. Majorities in the Latin America region express significant concern about the condition of the global economy. More than six-in-ten in all three countries surveyed there name it a large threat, making it the second-highest concern in Argentina and Brazil and the third-highest in Mexico. Half or more of people in these nations also see North Korea’s nuclear program and cyberattacks from other countries as major threats. The three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed express distinct top concerns. ISIS stands out as the greatest threat in Nigeria, where the ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa have a strong presence. About six-in-ten (61%) categorize the group as a major concern, an 8-point increase since the question was first asked in 2016. In Kenya, where droughts and extreme weather events have negatively affected agriculture, the public feels most threatened by global climate change (71%). This is true across gender, age, income and education groups. Majorities also see ISIS, cyberattacks, the global economy and North Korea’s nuclear program as major threats.1 For South Africans, cyberattacks from abroad are considered most threatening; 61% categorize them as a large threat. Climate change closely follows as a significant concern, with roughly six-in-ten respondents (59%) naming it as a major threat. Education and income are linked to concern about climate change in South Africa: Those with more education or incomes higher than the median are more likely to see climate change as a major threat. Across the Middle Eastern, sub-Saharan African and Latin American countries surveyed, there are a variety of international concerns, but generally, climate change and ISIS are seen as top threats. In both Tunisia and Israel, ISIS is considered the top threat. Roughly eight-in-ten Tunisians (81%) see the militant Islamic group as a major threat. They are additionally apprehensive about the condition of the world economy, cyberattacks and climate change. About six-in-ten (61%) also say U.S. power and influence are a major threat to their country. Israelis also see ISIS as the top international threat among those tested. However, only 47% label it a major threat, illustrating Israel’s relatively low level of concern about all threat items tested. Roughly four-in-ten see cyberattacks (42%) and climate change (38%) as pressing threats. Jewish Israelis are more likely than the country’s Arabs to be worried about North Korea’s nuclear program, ISIS, cyberattacks from other countries and the condition of the global economy. On the other hand, Arabs are more likely to categorize U.S. power and influence as a large threat. Ideology also affects how Israelis perceive global threats. Israelis on the ideological right are more likely than those on the left to see North Korea’s nuclear program (42% vs. 21%) and ISIS (53% vs. 36%) as major threats. Those on the right are also less concerned about climate change (32% vs. 46%) and the condition of the global economy (35% vs. 49%) than are those on the left. Compared with concerns about Russian or Chinese influence, worries about U.S. power and influence are relatively high in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia. More than half in these countries say U.S. power is a major threat to their country. By comparison, concerns about the U.S. are relatively lower in sub-Saharan Africa and Israel. In none of these countries does a majority express concern about Russian or Chinese power. Apprehension about U.S. power has also increased over time in these countries. In Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia, concerns have gone up by more than 25 percentage points from 2013 to 2018. Worries have increased the least in Israel (up 6 points).

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-drugs-el-chapo-dea-jack-riley_n_5c66dd0de4b05c889d1ebdc6---split---A former top Drug Enforcement Administration official who helped hunt down Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman said President Donald Trump’s border wall wouldn’t do much to stop the flow of deadly substances into the country. With most major drug loads coming through ports of entry rather than isolated parts of the border, former DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley said the government should be focusing on better manpower and screening at official channels. “It is far too risky and expensive for any of the cartels to move high-volume drugs through those desolate, really unwalled areas,” Riley told HuffPost. “I’m a little confused as to why our guy in the White House really doesn’t understand that. ... On the drug side, we know that nearly 80 percent of all the drugs we’re dealing with ― coke, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl and marijuana ― they come through existing ports of entry.” Trump, in declaring a national emergency on Friday in an attempt to reroute billions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund his border wall, dismissed the views of drug trafficking experts who say that most drugs coming over the border come through ports of entry. “A big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads don’t go through ports of entry,” Trump said at a White House press conference after declaring the emergency. “They can’t go through ports of entry.” He called it a lie that drugs are mostly coming through the ports of entry. But Riley, who was the target of an assassination plot by El Chapo’s crew, said that “very little” drug trafficking takes place outside ports of entry and that more manpower and technology at those entry points would be much more efficient. Fewer than a third of vehicles coming through ports of entry are thoroughly searched, Riley said, and it was part of El Chapo’s business model to use expressways and ports of entry because those are the “most economical way” to get shipments across the border. “If you’re El Chapo Guzman and you’re sitting in Sinaloa, you’re thinking ‘Hell, that’s damn near a 70 percent chance. I’m going to get seven of those 10 cars through.’ It’s like they say, you only had to bat .300 to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame,” Riley said. Slightly more than half the drugs by weight seized by U.S. Border Patrol agents last year were discovered outside legal ports of entry, according to preliminary Customs and Border Protection data for last year. But marijuana, which is legal in several U.S. states, accounted for 95 percent of the haul. As for the more serious drugs that have raised concern amid the opioid epidemic, the vast majority of seized shipments last year — including 90 percent of the heroin and 80 percent of fentanyl — were found at ports of entry. Riley is out with a new book, Drug Warrior: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo and the Rise of America’s Opioid Crisis, which recounts his career at the DEA from his days as an undercover officer in Chicago to his time as the agency’s No. 2 official. It also focuses on his work catching El Chapo, who was recently convicted on federal charges that will send him to prison for life. Riley said he fears that Trump’s rhetoric about Mexico is damaging the relationship between U.S. law enforcement officials and their counterparts across the border. “We would have never been able to capture El Chapo twice without the help of the [Mexican] marines,” Riley said, referring to El Chapo’s initial 2014 capture and recapture after his 2015 escape from a Mexican jail cell. “That was a trust-building situation that took years to do, and unfortunately with one condescending tweet, you can affect the relationships that guys worked so hard to build. I’m fearful that that’s what’s occurring.” Part of Trump’s plan would pull $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities. The plan doesn’t directly affect the DEA’s budget, but Riley said the agency is “resource starved” and operating with far fewer agents than it needs to execute its mission. Despite the title of his book, Riley said that the opioid crisis has shifted his thinking on the best ways to combat drug problems in the United States and that terms like “war on drugs” are inappropriate, if only because wars typically end. “I wouldn’t have told you this 20 years ago: We can’t arrest our way out of this. We’ve got to have a balanced approach, with universal treatment available for people who need it and want it,” he said. “I think we’ll be dealing with addiction, cartels and violence for the rest of our existence. It’s just how we choose to attack it.” Riley said that he has big concerns about the “cozy relationship” between big pharma and members of Congress and that the DEA had to “settle for a civil fine” instead of pursuing criminal cases time and time again. “A lot of that had to do with the influence of Congress on the Department of Justice,” he said. But fining big pharmaceutical companies a few million dollars was just the “cost of doing business” for them, he said. “To me, that’s like taking a truckload of narco-dollars from El Chapo. It has no effect.” “What I wish we would do is go after some of the executives criminally, where appropriate, and put them in jail, and that would send a signal throughout the industry that we’re serious,” Riley added. “Millionaire executives in custom suits, they’re not going to do too well playing kickball on the prison yard with some real felons. It will change the industry.” Additional reporting by Roque Planas. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-weld-donald-trump-2020-gop-primary_n_5c67081de4b033a799427d3d---split---BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) — William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor who ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016, became the first Republican to take a serious step toward challenging President Donald Trump in 2020. Speaking Friday at a breakfast in New Hampshire, Weld said he has created a presidential exploratory committee. He blasted Trump for leaving the nation in “grave peril.” “We have a president whose priorities are skewed towards promotion of himself rather than for the good of the country,” Weld said. “He may have great energy and considerable raw talent but he does not use that in ways that promote democracy, truth, justice and equal opportunity for all. To compound matters, our president is simply too unstable to carry out the duties of the highest executive office in the land.” The move makes Trump the first incumbent president since George H.W. Bush in 1992 to face a notable primary challenge. Other Republicans eyeing a presidential campaign include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Trump remains very popular with Republicans so faces little risk in losing the GOP nomination. But primary challenges often foreshadow trouble ahead for incumbent presidents. Bush and Jimmy Carter lost their bids for a second term after facing challenges from inside their own party. Asked to comment on Weld’s campaign, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders responded: “Who?” Stephen Stepanek, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, pointed to Weld’s past support of President Barack Obama and said he didn’t “expect his campaign to get very far among Republican primary voters. “The Republican Party is a big tent, but someone who endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 as the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee really needs to think about how welcome he is in the Republican Party,” Stepanek said in a statement. Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, the 73-year-old Weld ran on the Libertarian party ticket in 2016 with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, receiving about 4.5 million votes, or a little more than 3 percent of the national popular vote. Despite a pledge to libertarians that he would remain loyal to the party going forward, Weld on Jan. 17 walked into the clerk’s office of the Massachusetts town where he lives and re-registered with the GOP, adding to speculation that he would challenge Trump in the primaries. Weld has not won a political race since being re-elected governor by a landslide in his heavily Democratic state in 1994. He was first elected to the office in 1990, defeating a conservative Democratic candidate, and quickly became one of Massachusetts’ most popular governors in recent history. While holding the line on spending and taxes, Weld as governor embraced liberal positions at odds with national Republicans on abortion and gay rights. His low-key style and sharp wit also seemed to play well with voters as did his penchant for the unexpected: He once ended a news conference touting progress in cleaning up Boston’s polluted Charles River by diving fully clothed into the waterway. After winning a second term, Weld’s attention appeared to drift away the governor’s office and toward other political pursuits. He briefly entertained a run for president in 1996 before mounting an unsuccessful campaign that year to unseat Democratic Sen. John Kerry. He resigned as governor the following year after then-President Bill Clinton nominated him to be ambassador to Mexico, but it was a post he would never hold. Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina refused to schedule a hearing on the nomination, claiming among other things that Weld’s support for medical marijuana and needle exchange programs for drug users disqualified him from serving in Mexico because of that country’s history of drug trafficking. Weld fired back at Helms, suggesting it was un-American for Helms to refuse to hold a public hearing on a high-profile ambassadorial nomination. Weld left the public arena but later moved to New York, where he would make a brief, unsuccessful bid to become the first person since Sam Houston to serve as governor of two different states. Upon returning to Massachusetts, he joined ML Strategies, the lobbying arm of the high-powered law firm of Mintz Levin. He consulted for Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn during a regulatory process that in 2014 resulted in Wynn’s then-company being awarded a coveted license to operate the state’s only Boston-area casino. ___ Bob Salsberg reported from Boston.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/briefing/border-wall-illinois-colin-kaepernick.html---split---Supported by By Remy Tumin and Marcus Payadue (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump declared a national emergency to try and build a border wall that Congress refused to give him. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised announcement at the White House, above. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.” Nearly all of Mr. Trump’s claims about the southern border were misleading, exaggerated or false. House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block the president’s move. If approved by Congress, it would put the president in the position of issuing the first veto of his presidency. Here’s what might happen next. A last-minute tantrum by Mr. Trump nearly derailed a deal to avert another government shutdown and forced the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to accept an emergency declaration. We have a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came to a head. _____ 2. The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the next census questionnaire. A decision is expected before census forms are printed in June. Critics say that adding the question would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the form. About 6.5 million people might decide not to participate, according to one government estimate. That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending. _____ 3. Amazon was long accustomed to highly deferential treatment from localities across the country. But according to dozens of interviews this week, it badly misjudged how it would be received in New York. Thursday’s abrupt announcement that the tech company was canceling a deal to build a new campus in Long Island City, Queens, capped several days of intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering among government officials and Amazon executives. We took a look at how the deal collapsed. New York was one of two cities chosen for new Amazon campuses. Northern Virginia is keeping Amazon’s 25,000 jobs, and it wants you to know it. _____ 4. As the possibility grows of Britain leaving the E.U. with no deal, one country is seeing it as a beacon of hope: Many in Ireland believe a no-deal Brexit could lead to the country’s reunification with Northern Ireland. “The sense of a slow momentum toward Irish reunification has become a fast momentum now,” said an English economist based in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, where a defaced “Welcome to Northern Ireland” sign can be seen, above. But lurking in the background of the debate is the possibility that the imposition of a hard border between Britain and Ireland could reignite the violence that largely ended in 1998. And even still, the majority of voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would need to back reunification in a public referendum — and the British government has discretion over when to call a vote. Separately, check out our British-Irish dialect quiz to see what it says about where you’re from. (You can still play along even if you weren’t raised there.) _____ 5. A gunman opened fire inside an industrial complex in Aurora, Ill., killing more than one person and injuring several people. The gunman has been taken into custody, the police said. Scores of law enforcement authorities swarmed the area, and schools kept students inside. Among the injured were police officers, a city spokesman said, adding that they were in stable condition. It was not immediately clear how many people were injured. Check back here for updates. _____ 6. The N.F.L. and Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, have settled a case accusing the league of colluding to keep him off a team. Mr. Kaepernick, above center, has not played in the N.F.L. since the 2016 season, when he ignited a protest movement against racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem. He became a free agent in March 2017. As a parade of quarterbacks found work, he filed a grievance asserting that the league’s owners had conspired to keep him out because of his protests. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The league also settled a similar claim lodged by another player, Eric Reid, above right, who knelt alongside Kaepernick and went unsigned for a period. _____ 7. Terminally ill federal prisoners have long had the option of applying for what is called compassionate release — at least in theory. But in practice, that reprieve has come too late for many. An analysis of federal data by The New York Times and The Marshall Project found that 266 inmates who had applied from 2013 to 2017 had died, either after being denied or while still waiting for a decision. During the same period, the bureau approved only 6 percent of applications. One of the provisions of the new criminal justice law signed by President Trump in December gives inmates the ability to appeal directly to the courts. Steve Cheatham, 59, seen above with his wife, did just that, filing a petition last month so that he could go home to die. He was among the first to be granted release under the new law — but he died before he could make it home. _____ 8. First stop: Puerto Rico. Our new 52 Places Traveler started his yearlong journey there, one and a half years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. He knew he would see progress, but “what I didn’t expect to see were the omnipresent smiles, the sense of optimism shared by so many people I met,” he writes.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/opinion/trump-national-emergency.html---split---Supported by The fact that the president may have the authority to throw away billions on a foolish campaign promise is itself scandalous. By Peter H. Schuck Mr. Schuck is an emeritus professor of law at Yale and scholar-in-residence at N.Y.U. President Trump has declared a national emergency — purely in order to fund his wall. The courts may — or may not — reject his gambit. But the fact that he may actually possess the legal authority to require agencies to waste billions of dollars simply to fulfill a foolish campaign promise he thinks won him the election is itself scandalous. The theatrics surrounding his petulant threat to do so obscure a vital question for our democracy going far beyond this (non)crisis, a question to which Congress should immediately turn: Who decides what constitutes a national emergency? In hundreds of laws, Congress has given the president the power to decide. (The Brennan Center for Justice has compiled an exhaustive list.) But by failing to define crucial terms, legal standards and accountability rules, Congress has handed presidents an all-too-handy tool of tyranny commonly used by autocrats to amass more power, crush dissent and eviscerate democratic institutions. In Mr. Trump’s case, it has handed an unguided missile to an ignorant, impetuous man-child. Congress should have known better. After all, it enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which purported to regulate such declarations, only two years after President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power forced his resignation. The act actually made matters worse in a key respect: It defined a national emergency as “a general declaration of emergency made by the president.” This circular definition, of course, is no constraint at all. Or as Humpty Dumpty says to Alice, “it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.” In the nature of national emergencies, some definitional leeways are unavoidable. But Congress could readily specify certain conditions that must exist before the president can make such a declaration and thus arrogate to himself extraordinary powers — curtailing liberties, seizing property, spending funds appropriated for other purposes and suspending protective laws — that Congress would not otherwise be likely to grant him in advance, or perhaps ever. (Indeed, Congress has the power to override Mr. Trump's declaration and it should in this case — though it probably won’t.) One can easily specify some of the factors in a national emergency condition that any responsible Congress would insist on before allowing such a declaration to take effect: magnitude (the feared incremental harms of the condition are very large, not just marginal); geographic scope (those harms should be nationwide even if the triggering condition is more localized); extraordinary (the condition should be rare, if not unprecedented); imminence (the anticipated harms should be so close in time that Congress cannot deliberate); and likely effectiveness (the president’s action should promise to substantially solve the problem). Reasonable people may disagree, of course, about precisely how Congress should define and weigh these factors, how they should be applied to the facts on the ground and whether other factors should be considered. President Trump’s wall cannot survive such a rigorous analysis: Even assuming that recent illegal border crossings harm the nation, they are not greater (indeed, they are probably fewer) than in recent decades; Congress has been deliberating (in its fashion) for decades about immigration reform, including border walls; and many Americans believe that the wall would be ineffective and a bad idea. Congress simply disagrees with the president about which border security measures would do the job — an instance of decidedly normal politics. But my larger claim — that Congress’s delegation to presidents of vast, essentially unconstrained power to declare national emergencies has been an irresponsible surrender of its constitutional responsibilities — does not depend on whether my assessment of this particular case is correct. Not since the New Deal has the Supreme Court struck down a statute for this kind of standardless delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies, but the Roberts court — activist, conservative and suspicious of broad delegations of power to agencies — recently reached out to review a case, Gundy v. United States, that gives it an opportunity to revive the long-dormant and doubtful non-delegation doctrine. Another way to make the National Emergencies Act more compatible with the rule of law is through a procedure that would broaden participation in all future decisions to declare national emergencies. Under one such reform, the president would have to consult with the leaders of both parties in Congress before issuing a declaration. Even if Congress could not override such a declaration, members would have to take a public position on the facts and reasons invoked as justification by the president. If time were of the essence (not so in this case; Congress has legislated about a wall for more than a decade), their responses would have to be expedited. With such a procedure in place, judicial review of the declaration could be narrow, if at all. If national emergency declarations are as important as presidents (with Congress’s acquiescence) claim them to be, then they are important enough to be subjected to such standards and procedures. In the long run, this is more crucial to the vitality of our democracy than whether President Trump ultimately gets his wall. This article has been updated to reflect news developments. Peter H.

---split---5.0---split---https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/manage/---split---Select the newsletters you want to receive. It’s Valentine’s Day, Short Listers, and my mom's love life may no longer be our greatest national emergency. Today I'm loving this cuddly alligator and very much not loving the latest gross-sounding allegations about R. Kelly. Let's get to today's top news. But first: A deadly "zombie" deer disease is now in 25 states. Even worse: One expert claimed it could affect humans. President Donald Trump will sign a funding bill securing some money for a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border before declaring a national emergency to get more funding for a wall, the White House said Thursday. The measure, which offers $1.375 billion for a 55-mile border barrier – much less than the $5.7 billion that Trump demanded – was cleared by Congress Thursday evening. The spending bill now heads to Trump, who must sign it by midnight Friday to avoid another government shutdown. Declaring an emergency, however, could trigger a legal fight delaying construction at the border. But that drawn-out legal battle would give Trump a potent issue to run on ahead of 2020. Remember that second Amazon headquarters announced for New York City? Yeah, that’s not happening. In a stunning development, Amazon said Thursday it will no longer pursue their new Queens headquarters in Long Island City amid local political opposition. Amazon promised over 25,000 jobs for the city in exchange for up to $3 billion in tax breaks from state and city governments. “While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence,” the company said. The Senate on Thursday made William Barr attorney general, handing him a Justice Department with multiple investigations encircling a president who's been sharply critical of the agency's leadership. The largely party-line vote (54-45) came with concerns from some Democrats about how Barr aimed to oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation tied to the 2016 election. Barr, 68, is a widely respected Washington lawyer who already served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Attorney Michael Avenatti, who repped Stormy Daniels in her battle with Trump, has a new target: singer and accused predator R. Kelly. Avenatti claims he's unearthed "a bombshell of epic proportions" in a videotape from the 1990s of Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Avenatti shared it with CNN and the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "It's over, after nearly two decades of sexual abuse by R. Kelly," Avenatti told USA TODAY, predicting that the singer would not "survive" the discovery of the alleged tape. CNN reported Thursday that it viewed the tape and says it appears to show a man resembling Kelly having sex with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old and, at several points, calls the man "Daddy." Better late than never. After months of promises, our favorite climate agitator finally formed this week, climate scientists said Thursday. To review: El Niño is a periodic natural warming of seawater in the tropical Pacific. It's one of the biggest influences on weather and climate in the world. All this winter weather lately has had an El Niño flavor, even though it hadn't officially formed. Weak El Niño conditions should stay through the spring, weather experts say.

Leadership Conference For Civil And Human Rights President and CEO Vanita Gupta speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington last year on the Trump administration's decision to add a new question on citizenship to the 2020 Census. (Photo11: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON – The Trump administration's controversial plan to determine who is and who is not a U.S. citizen during the 2020 census will be decided by the Supreme Court. The justices agreed Friday to squeeze the blockbuster case on to their April calendar, presumably because the decennial census questionnaire is scheduled for printing this summer. Critics of the administration's effort, including California, the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant-rights groups, have argued that the Commerce Department is trying to intimidate both undocumented and legal immigrants. If their headcount is suppressed, it could reduce the allocation of federal resources and congressional seats to immigrant communities. A federal district judge in New York struck down the plan last month, ruling that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross exceeded his authority when he announced the inclusion of the citizenship question. Judge Jesse Furman said that the likely undercount of immigrants would mean that California would face "a certainly impending loss of representation in the House of Representatives," and Texas, Arizona, Florida, New York and Illinois would face "a substantial risk of losing a seat." In addition, he said, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia likely would be among those losing federal funds. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, sidestepping a federal appeals court because of the tight timetable. "The effect of the district court’s decision is that the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population," Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the court in his request. Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco applauded the court's decision to hear the case "defending the government’s legal and reasonable decision." She reiterated the administration's claim, disputed by opponents, that Ross acted because the department seeks "better data to protect American voters against racial discrimination." Opponents have alleged that Ross chose to ask about citizenship after conversations with top Trump administration officials at the time, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. In his 277-page ruling, Furman dismissed Ross's contention that he acted on the Justice Department's request. He said Ross and his aides sought the citizenship question for other reasons and then "acted like people with something to hide." New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is leading the opposition to the administration's effort, had urged the justices to let the district court ruling stand. Lawyers for the House of Representatives, now controlled by Democrats, argued that the administration cannot undermine "the Census’s constitutional purpose: obtaining an actual enumeration of the country’s total population." The government has not asked about individuals' citizenship on the Census since 1950. The question is included in the American Community Survey, a sample survey conducted annually by the Census Bureau to provide updated demographic information. By agreeing to hear the case, the justices juiced up a low-key docket that had helped them avoid the spotlight following the contentious confirmation last fall of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct. Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal American Constitution Society, warned that the Supreme Court may see the issue differently than Judge Furman. "The court should affirm the district court’s decision, but with its new 5-4 conservative majority, including the newly-minted and controversial Justice Kavanaugh, that may be a faint hope," Fredrickson said.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/2020-democratic-candidates-opposed-spending-bill---split---Gillibrand and her liberal colleagues in the Senate who are running for president opposed the spending bill. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Senate Democrats eyeing the White House split their vote Thursday on the compromise spending package that would avert another government shutdown, with nearly all the candidates who have already announced bids voting against it. The Senate overwhelmingly adopted the conference report, 83-16, but five Democrats, including four presidential contenders — Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — joined 11 Republicans in voting ‘no.’ Of the announced candidates, only Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar supported the measure. Vermont independent Bernie Sanders (who caucuses with the Democrat) and Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, neither of whom have officially jumped in the race, also voted for the package as did Colorado’s Michael Bennet and Oregon’s Jeff Merkley, who are said to be weighing 2020 runs. The more liberal Democrats in the field are positioning themselves in the Senate to win the nomination by setting up a contrast to President Donald Trump, whom the White House has said will sign the spending package Friday. Several pro-immigration groups came out against the compromise measure, saying it made too many concessions to Trump. While the bill wouldn’t give the president the $5.7 billion for the border wall that he wanted, it does include $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of barriers along the border with Mexico. The White House confirmed Thursday that Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border to redirect military funds for his desired wall, which Democrats oppose and have threatened to challenge in court. Candidates who opposed the bill spoke out against the emergency declaration, with many referring to the wall as Trump’s “vanity project.” “The President is going to abuse his power with a non-credible national emergency to go around Congress and waste taxpayer dollars for an ineffective border wall,” Gillibrand said in a statement Thursday evening. She specifically cited the spending measure’s increased funding for the Immigration and Custom Enforcement agency, saying “it comes with no accountability and will give the President the ability to continue his inhumane policies.” Booker offered a similar reasoning for his ‘no’ vote: “This funding bill gives ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] hundreds of millions of additional dollars with little oversight or appropriate guardrails.” Harris voted against the bill out of concern about the increase in funding for the Department of Homeland Security and potential increased capacity for detention facilities. Sanders said he had reservations about the legislation but ultimately supported it because of the federal workers affected by the last shutdown. “I cannot turn my back on the two million federal employees and private contract workers who would be forced, again, to work without pay,” the Vermont independent said in a statement. Across the Capitol, the House later voted comfortably, 300-128, to adopt the spending package. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who entered the Democratic presidential race last month, voted for the measure, as did California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a potential candidate.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-passes-appropriations-package-avert-shutdown-sends-trump---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conducts her weekly news conference Thursday in which she fielded questions about the government funding bill. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) The House passed a spending package Thursday night, completing congressional action to avert a government shutdown with barely a day to spare. The final vote was 300-128. Nineteen Democrats voted against the measure, while 109 Republicans, representing a majority of their conference, were opposed. Earlier in the day, the Senate passed the $333 billion fiscal 2019 package by an 83-16 vote. It contains seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills that were not signed into law before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. The four-and-a-half month delay in completing the fiscal 2019 appropriations process arose over an impasse over the Homeland Security bill — in particular President Donald Trump’s request for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. After a 35-day partial government shutdown over that issue that stretched from late December to late January, a House-Senate conference committee was formed to negotiate the final details on border security spending. The 17 appropriators on the conference committee narrowed in on a solution, before the top four appropriators from both chambers reached an agreement in principle Monday night. The final package provides just under $1.4 billion for a physical border barrier. Trump’s frustration with that figure is why he has decided to declare a national emergency to give himself the flexibility to divert other funds for construction of a barrier. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump will declare the national emergency when he signs the spending package, which is expected to be Friday given that’s the final day to prevent the government from shutting down again. The Kentucky Republican said he will support Trump’s emergency declaration, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic Caucus are opposed. The California Democrat called it “an end-run” around Congress that should alarm Republicans too. “It is interesting to see how the president has said to the Republican leadership in the Senate ... ‘I don’t have confidence in what you did,’ even though the president failed to convince the American people and their representatives in Congress of his position,” Pelosi said. Most House Republicans voted against the appropriations package because of their frustration over the lack of border wall funding, including Georgia Rep. Tom Graves, the only one of the 17 conferees who did not sign the conference report. Still, Republicans got some wins in the bill. In particular, they rejected Democrats’ demand to put a cap on the number of detention beds that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency could use for undocumented immigrants apprehended in the interior of the country, versus at the border. Some Democrats, such as Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Pramila Jayapal, voted against the legislation because of the detention issue. The legislation barely reduced the number of beds or provided restrictions that would help clamp down on the administration’s immigration enforcement policies, some progressives argued.

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for a border wall in a speech at the White House on Friday. Calling it "a great thing to do," President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in order to help finance a long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The move followed Congress approving a government spending bill that allocated $1.3 billion in funding for a wall. But with executive action and the national emergency declaration, Trump is expected to free up about $8 billion for construction of the wall. On today's NPR Politics Podcast, political reporter Asma Khalid, White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional correspondent Susan Davis talk about what it means for Trump to declare a national emergency and what his reasoning is behind the declaration.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rican-officials-warn-against-diverting-recovery-funds-wall-n972056---split---WASHINGTON — María Meléndez, the mayor of Ponce, Puerto Rico’s second-largest city, came to Washington this week on a mission to ensure that federal aid already allocated for hurricane recovery is finally delivered to her city and others on the island. Meléndez's visit to talk about local governance during natural disasters and crisis management came a day before Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall that he dangled as a presidential campaign promise. After multiple reports surfaced saying that funds allocated for recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria could be used to finance the wall, Trump’s action has heightened concerns among Puerto Rican officials who have vowed to fight such a move. “If the president intends to use his emergency powers to take funds from Puerto Rico and other states, I'll see him in court," Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said on Twitter early Friday morning. "Our island urgently needs the disbursement of the money allocated to direct and reconstruction." Hours later, a senior administration official said that taking any disaster relief funds away from Puerto Rico and Texas was not part of the plan, adding that the $8 billion they currently plan to use for the wall should be sufficient. While much attention has been paid to the capital city of San Juan and its recuperation efforts, other island cities and towns have been often overlooked and have the added burden of lacking the resources and personnel to help in a recovery. More than 400 buildings in Ponce were damaged during Hurricane Maria in 2017, damage is estimated at more than $500 million, and the cost of reconstruction is estimated to be at least $200 million. “We are used to hurricanes, but nothing like what happened with Hurricane Maria. It was total devastation and we still need to reconstruct the island. It is a long recovery. We need those funds,” Meléndez, known as Mayita, told NBC News after participating in a forum Thursday at New York University's Washington Center. After the hurricane hit, many homeowners on the island, particularly in rural areas, ran into bureaucratic red tape in applying for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency because they could not prove ownership. Meléndez told of a long-time resident whose home had been handed down through the generations and who, right before the hurricane, had taken out a loan to renovate it, only to lose it in Hurricane Maria. “And when he applied for assistance from FEMA, they said he had no proof that he was the owner.” Community organizations and law schools on the island have been working with homeowners, Meléndez adds, to assist them in getting federal aid even without a title or deed, and that can include a letter from the mayor’s office attesting to the ownership of the home. But the key in really helping Ponce and other cities move forward, the mayor said, is swift action on disbursing the funds to Puerto Rico. Congress last year approved $20 billion in Community Development Block Grants for disaster relief to repair its electric grid and repair homes, but just a fraction of those funds have made its way to the island. Additionally, the Trump administration hints it may take some of those disaster relief funds to help pay for a border wall if Congress does not fully fund it. The government of Puerto Rico has said it will sue the federal government should that occur. “I really hope that it doesn’t happen," Meléndez said of a lawsuit. "Congress already approved that money, those funds have to get to Puerto Rico.” “I hope President Trump understands the needs we have on the island and that the comments that funds will be diverted from hurricane recovery to build a border wall are just that, comments, and not real," she said. "There’s a lot of support in Congress for us to get the funds. We have filled out all the necessary paperwork and turned in all the documents. We’ve done everything we been asked and we’re still waiting, 16 months later.” Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y., a native of Puerto Rico, introduced legislation this week that would prevent the Trump administration from diverting previously allocated disaster relief funds to finance a border wall. “Like many of my colleagues in Congress, I was alarmed when it was reported that the administration is mulling taking resources meant to help Puerto Ricans who are still suffering from Hurricane Maria and diverting those funds to pay for Donald Trump’s stupid, hateful border wall,” Velázquez said in a statement. “The idea that we would siphon assistance from one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history and spend that money on a project aimed at demonizing immigrants is appalling. My colleagues and I will fight such a preposterous move with every ounce of energy we have.” “Before Hurricane Maria, there were political differences among us," Meléndez said, referring to the island's mayors. "I’m of one party and the mayors of surrounding municipalities are of another and we rarely talked. But after the hurricane we have all come together to help each other." That alliance between Ponce and surrounding municipalities allows them to spread the costs of reconstruction and allows for greater flexibility in negotiating contracts and other rebuilding efforts. Additionally, the city of Ponce has granted exemptions on building permits to speed up construction and get businesses and homeowners back on their feet. While residents have electricity, some streets are still dark because damaged light poles have yet to be repaired. Meléndez is hoping that the administration and members of Congress — regardless of current political battles — ensure that the funds necessary for Puerto Rico's reconstruction reach the island. “Fortunately we have a lot of support in Congress to get the assistance that’s coming to us,” she said.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/green-new-deal-trump.html---split---Supported by Even the necessary idealism of the Green New Deal. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Amid the unceasing awfulness of the Trump administration, I’ve lately found comfort in the Yale political scientist Stephen Skowronek’s concept of “political time,” which has in turn informed my thinking about the almost utopian ambitions of the Green New Deal. Surveying the American presidency, Skowronek sees politics unfolding in cycles. Every so often, insurgent coalitions bring an agenda-setting president to power who sweeps away the verities of the old regime, fundamentally restructuring our politics. These “reconstructive presidents,” as Skowronek refers to them, create the political framework that their successors of both parties must operate within. In time, however, insurgencies calcify into enervated establishments. They become dependent on what Skowronek, in his book “Presidential Leadership in Political Time,” called “sectarian interests with myopic demands.” As the regime’s “political energies dissipate,” he wrote, it becomes an obstacle to addressing the country’s most urgent challenges. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In the resulting atmosphere of crisis and upheaval, a new coalition can bring a new reconstructive president to power. When that happens, Skowronek wrote, governing priorities are “durably recast,” and a “corresponding set of legitimating ideas becomes the new common sense.” Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a reconstructive president. So was Ronald Reagan. The assumptions of New Deal liberalism governed American politics from 1932 to 1980. The assumptions of the conservative movement have dominated thereafter, though perhaps not for much longer. Viewed through this schema, Donald Trump’s presidency looks more like the end of a cycle than the end of the Republic. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and the early months of the Trump administration, the constitutional law professors Jack Balkin and Sanford Levinson exchanged letters arguing about the durability of our system; the letters will be published this spring as a book, “Democracy and Dysfunction.” Balkin is the more sanguine of the two, in part because he sees Trump fitting into Skowronek’s model. Trump’s presidency, wrote Balkin, could be what Skowronek called “disjunctive,” meaning one “in which a president allied with an aging political regime promises to restore its dominance and former greatness, is unable to keep all of the elements of his coalition together, and as a result presides over the regime’s dissolution.” If this analysis is correct, intrepid activists have a chance to decide what comes next. “In the next few election cycles, a new regime will begin, offering the possibility of a new beginning in American politics,” wrote Balkin. The young progressives pushing the Green New Deal have a similar sense of historic opportunity. Waleed Shahid, communications director for the Justice Democrats — the group that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress — frames the Green New Deal as an overarching vision for political renewal. “This is not just an environmental sustainability policy,” Shahid told me. “It’s also about rewriting and expanding the social contract that began under the New Deal, was expanded under the civil rights movement and then was completely torn apart over the past 50 years.” A rapidly congealing conventional wisdom holds that the Green New Deal is likely to be electoral kryptonite for Democrats. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, clearly thinks the proposal is politically toxic, which is why he plans to have senators vote on it. Maybe McConnell is right. I’ve lived through enough right-wing backlashes to worry about left-wing overreach. But it seems at least possible that, at this moment of social breakdown and planetary emergency, the calculus of what’s politically feasible could be changing. The electorate certainly is; within the next decade, millennials, the most diverse and perhaps most progressive generation in history, will be the single largest voting bloc. If we are in fact on the cusp of a new political epoch, then a sweeping, idealistic plan for social transformation is not a wild fantasy but a practical necessity. This is not to say there’s nothing to dispute in the Green New Deal resolution introduced in Congress last week. Ocasio-Cortez’s staff certainly made a mistake by releasing a flip document about the resolution saying that it will be impossible to “fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes” in 10 years, giving Republicans an opening to claim that Democrats want to ban hamburgers and air travel. Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith makes a convincing case for a version of a Green New Deal that emphasizes funding for the development and export of green technologies and includes a carbon tax and carbon tariffs. The United States, after all, is responsible for only about 14 percent of current global greenhouse gas emissions; in a hypothetical future where America became a leader on climate, it would probably have to use economic incentives to convince other countries to change their behavior. Still, the fact that more centrist thinkers are now coming up with their own takes on the Green New Deal is testament to the idea’s conceptual power. If there’s a mainstream debate about how best to completely reorient the economy around environmental sustainability, then the proponents of the Green New Deal are already winning. Democrats who are dismissive of the Green New Deal, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, have written it off as a “dream.” But if America is going to start again after the nightmare of Trump, maybe dreaming big is what’s needed.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/congress-spending-bill-wall-money-border-tech/---split---After weeks—years, really—of debate over the Trump administration's proposed wall at the US-Mexico border, Congress will vote on a spending bill Thursday that includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of border fence construction. In response, President Donald Trump signaled that he will declare a national emergency to get the wall built regardless. Doing so will create more problems than it solves. Beyond the politicization of a wall as a cure-all for immigration woes, border security experts continue to stress—as they have since Trump's campaign days—that a physical wall is simply not a practical or effective way to support law enforcement at the border. While human rights and privacy groups raise important concerns about alternatives like border-surveillance technologies, or the concept of a "smart wall," the fact is that Democrats and Republicans in Congress largely agree on how to fund border patrol and enforcement technologies. And despite the pressures of a looming deadline that may yet again shut down the government, Capitol Hill has denied Trump the contiguous wall he has so adamantly championed. "The wall is expensive and unnecessary given the current level of flow into the United States," says Alex Nowrasteh, senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. "These government mega-construction projects usually cost at least 50 percent more than what’s budgeted. We estimate that each mile of wall would cost about $36 million to construct, and it won’t have a major impact on deterrence, because most of the people coming are asking for asylum." "It’s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we’re doing." Christopher Wilson, Wilson Center Thirty years ago, illegal border crossings at the border largely consisted of Mexican men trying to get into the US to find work. The billions of dollars the US has spent to date on physical barriers were founded in that reality. But today, despite Trump's "bad hombres" rhetoric, the majority of those approaching or attempting to cross the border are women and children seeking asylum. That often occurs at official points of entry anyway; when it doesn't, asylum seekers still generally intend to turn themselves in quickly. Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, says that these days the most constructive funding is for "border security that isn’t about the wall." "A lot of it needs to go to the ports of entry rather than the areas between the ports of entry," Wilson says. "It’s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we’re doing, both in terms of facilitating legal travel and trade while enhancing border security." Wilson notes that physical barriers at the border have historically been a helpful deterrent to marijuana trafficking, but that they are less effective at slowing the flow of high-potency drugs like the synthetic opioid fentanyl. These drugs can be trafficked in much smaller quantities and smuggled through legitimate points of entry like checkpoints, on airplanes, and in the mail. Cato's Nowrasteh calls the wall proposal "yesterday’s solution to yesterday’s problem—at best." Physical barriers also don't eliminate criminal behavior; they just relocate it. "If we rely on the wall to stop individuals, and we don't also improve detection methods through technology and response through personnel, then we will find routes across the border displaced rather than deterred," says Brandon Behlendorf, a homeland security researcher at SUNY-Albany. "You also need technology—cameras, sensors, databases, et cetera—and personnel agents and support staff to secure the borders." The widely varied geography and topography of the US-Mexico border also calls for a variety of protective measures. There's no one-wall-fits-all solution. In remote regions, where it takes time for enforcement personnel to respond to potentially illegal activity, physical barriers—like the hundreds of miles of fencing that already exists at the border—are relatively effective and help buy time for enforcement response. In areas where border personnel are based or have an established presence, such physical barriers can actually inhibit security efforts, making it logistically harder for agents to see what's going on and get to the right spots quickly. "The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium." Brandon Behlendorf, SUNY-Albany To that end, Thursday's 1,159-page spending bill earmarks three-quarters of a billion dollars for border security technology, of which $570 million must focus on "non-intrusive inspection equipment at ports of entry." Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security have been working for years to develop an array of border-security tech tools that include body scanners, cameras, infrared sensors, and radar deployed to collectively create a sort of invisible web or dome along and across the border. Sensors are positioned on the ground, on fences, on posts, and higher up through CBP's Integrated Fixed Towers program—which is working on syncing and coordinating various types of sensors. Another crucial component is aerial monitoring from manned planes and helicopters, as well as drones and sensor-equipped blimps. Thursday's bill includes about $2.5 billion to be dispensed through 2023 on border-security-related vehicles, including drones. "It does not fund the president’s wall, but it does support smart border-security initiatives that both parties have always supported, including increased security at our ports of entry and humanitarian assistance at the border," said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on the floor Thursday. "Most importantly, it will keep our government open." Most of all, the months and years spent arguing about a wall could have been much better spent implementing an array of border protections to be effective, but also humane and privacy-preserving. "As you implement new technologies along the border, there are lots of important questions about how to go about doing it," the Wilson Center's Wilson says. "Like is it collecting personal data that needs to be protected? It's kind of crazy that instead of having those important discussions we’re having this wild political discussion about a wall." Analysts also consistently emphasize the importance of seeing border security in the larger context of geopolitics and policy decisions. "Border security is not a stand-alone thing," SUNY's Behlendorf says. "It is part of a larger immigration and border-security system, and some of the most effective solutions to border security lie outside direct efforts to secure the border. Deploying technology is important, but so is reducing immigration court backlogs and improving legitimate entry into the United States, including asylum requests. The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium." Meanwhile, by declaring a national emergency over something that is clearly not one, Trump sets a dangerous precedent and unlocks executive authority that will likely face bipartisan pushback. It's unclear, though, whether anyone has the authority to stop him. The LAPD is one of a growing number of police departments using algorithms to try to predict crimes before they happen. Proponents of these tools say they provide cops with added tools to keep their cities safe -- but critics argue it's just another form of profiling. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tax-refunds-gop-law_n_5c671dcee4b033a799429900---split---Republicans boasted all last year that their new tax law boosted paychecks and showered bonuses on several million workers. But now that tax season is upon us, several million Americans are getting a nasty surprise: a bill from the Internal Revenue Service that they never expected. Beth Callori of Long Island, New York, said she was thrilled to receive about $90 more in each paycheck last year. Thanks to the new lower federal income tax rates, Callori’s employer, a financial services firm, was withholding less from her paycheck for federal tax purposes. “I thought, ‘Wow, Trump is great, I love him,’” Callori said. But last week Callori heard from her tax preparer that she owes the federal government more than $5,000 ― almost five times as much as she had to pay in previous years. “I almost fell out of my chair. I could not believe it,” she said. “I voted for Trump. I thought he was going to be good for this country, but when I got that phone call, that’s it, I’m done.” Callori’s tax bill went up for two reasons. One is that the law directly disadvantaged her by limiting deductions for state and local taxes, which increased the amount of Callori’s income subject to tax and added an extra grand to her bill. The bigger reason is that her employer withheld too little from her paycheck. The extra $90 she received should have been added to the amount that gets automatically socked away to cover the federal income tax. Like most people, however, Callori did not fill out a worksheet and submit a new Form W-4 to her employer at the beginning of last year. After all, at that time Republicans kept bragging about the bigger paychecks they had given the American people. “I thought because I was getting that, I’m entitled to it,” Callori said. The vast majority of Americans got lower taxes from the new law, while only 5 percent or so should have seen a tax increase. Most people should have seen the changes in their paychecks last February. But the way the Trump administration implemented the law has caused a separate problem ― one that the administration knew would result in something like 5 million fewer households receiving tax refunds this year. It’s still early in tax filing season, which opened at the end of January, but the average refund is down 8.7 percent so far. The Treasury Department suggested tax refunds are bad anyway because they result from people overpaying the government. “Smaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers,” a spokesperson said in an email. The problem is, it’s not just smaller refunds ― it’s that paycheck withholding for this tax season is less accurate in general. Treasury has said it expected the percentage of people withholding too much tax in their paychecks to decline from 76 to 73 percent, but the percentage withholding accurately is not increasing at all. Instead, Treasury expected the rate of under-withholding to go from 18 to 21 percent. Those people all owe the IRS. The households most at risk are ones with higher incomes, two earners and slightly more complicated taxes ― especially households that used to itemize their deductions. Instead of taking the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by a set value, itemizers would add up what they spent on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving, and deduct that sum instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the advantage of itemizing and limited the deduction for state and local tax. But the Trump administration decided not to make major changes to the withholding tables that employers are required to use to make sure everybody is paying the right amount of tax. The value of “allowances” that workers can choose on Form W-4 to adjust their withholding has been pegged for years to something called the personal exemption ― which the new tax law eliminated. So they set the value of allowances to last year’s personal exemption and adjusted for inflation. Coming up with new forms would have taken at least half a year, and would have been a chore for everyone. “There’s this tension … You’d like to get all the information needed to calculate withholding as accurately as possible, but that gets very complicated for taxpayers,” said Joe Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center. The administration could have let people withhold too much rather than surprise them with bills at tax time, Democrats have said. “It looks like the Trump Treasury Department spent 2018, an election year, goosing people’s paychecks by under-withholding, and it should have been obvious that the bill would come due eventually,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Friday. The IRS did try to warn people to check their withholding. The agency told the Government Accountability Office that it put out press releases and sent emails to listservs with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It promoted a “paycheck checkup” campaign on Twitter and Facebook, and officials talked to the media. The “make sure you’re not underwithheld” messaging may have been drowned out by congressional Republicans bragging that their law had turbocharged the economy and directly benefited millions of workers. They kept a running tally of the hundreds of firms that had announced bonuses for their workers, trumpeting each announcement in a series of press releases. Fox News worked overtime to remind people that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously called the bonuses crumbs. Another problem, which is not Republicans’ fault, is that even though everyone pays taxes, not everyone understands them very well. Less than half of Americans said they knew they could update their W-4 forms at any time and only 19 percent had actually done so, according to a November survey by the tax prep company H&R Block. Twice as many survey respondents said they updated their W-2, which is actually a document prepared by employers, not workers. Also, some filers are surprised by tax bills simply because they didn’t realize some of the money they earned needed to be taxed. “They’ll have some side job where there’s no withholding and that’s creating this new tax liability,” H&R Block’s Nathan Rigney said, pointing to the rise of non-employee gigs like Uber and Taskrabbit. By capping deductions for state and local taxes, Republicans knew the tax hikes in their law would be concentrated on states with high taxes ― which tend to be led by Democrats, who use the taxes to provide more social services. But it’s not just wealthy New Yorkers who’ve wound up paying more. Kurt Kromm is an electrician in Kenosha, Wisconsin ― an area that used to be represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Kromm knew he and his wife would pay higher taxes because of the limit on deductions for state and local taxes, but he didn’t think they would owe more than $4,000 this spring. Kromm had already indicated on the Form W-4 documents he’d previously submitted to his employer that he was married and wanted zero allowances, which means he was withholding as much as he could without specifying an additional dollar amount. “I figured married and zero would probably be appropriate,” Kromm said. “They spent no time trying to really put out a decent withholding table.” Kromm’s case shows the two-earner household pitfall. After he realized how much he owes, he went to the withholding calculator on IRS.gov and realized he could have either told his employer to take an additional $80 per week or just put “single” on his W-4, since single people face higher rates and therefore higher withholding. If he had done so last year, he could have had less money in each paycheck but saved himself the aggravation of making a large payment. But not even the administration expected people to go to such lengths ― in its simulations of how people would be affected, the IRS assumed nobody would adjust their W-4s. “It’s unreasonable to expect working people with busy lives to start the year out by crunching the numbers on their tax withholding with the rigor of a workaholic [certified public accountant],” Wyden said. Beth Callori, for her part, said she had also previously chosen zero allowances ― plus she had an extra $130 withheld from each paycheck. It wasn’t enough. She said she used to love Donald Trump. Not anymore. “I really liked things he was doing, until this, and now I hate him,” she said. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-drug-dealers-death-penalty_n_5c66e2b8e4b033a7994228a3---split---President Donald Trump remarked on Friday that he wants drug dealers to get the death penalty. Speaking to reporters outside the Oval Office, he declared a national emergency over the non–national emergency of his wanting a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In a typically rambling speech, he also touched on his continued obsession with wanting to kill people who sell drugs. Trump explains that he'd like American drug laws to be more like China's, where drug dealers receive the death penalty. pic.twitter.com/sBo7EAnaN0 “Last year 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl,” Trump said before describing a meeting he had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “[China’s] criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list,” Trump said. “Their criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty, our criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called how bout a fine? And when I asked President Xi, I said, ‘Do you have a drug problem?’ ‘No, no, no.’ I said, ‘You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you don’t have a drug problem?’ ‘No, we don’t have a drug problem.’ I said, ‘Why?’ ‘Death penalty, we give death penalty to people that sell drugs. End of problem.’ What do we do? We set up a blue ribbon committees. Lovely men and women, they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time. So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem. You can end it a lot faster than you think.” At a campaign rally last March, Trump told supporters that executing drug dealers is “a discussion we have to start thinking about.” In that speech, he praised Singapore and China for their zero-tolerance policies on dealing drugs. “That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty,” he said of Singapore, recalling a conversation he had with the country’s president. “And they don’t have a problem.” The comments fly in the face of the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that would overhaul prison sentencing laws that Trump endorsed in November. The bill would help rehabilitate federal inmates for a life outside prison by expanding employment opportunities and incentivizing their participation in rehabilitation programs and would institute “reasonable sentencing reforms,” he said at the time. “We’re all better off when former inmates can receiver and re-enter society as law-abiding, productive citizens,” he said at the time. But just one month later, Trump tweeted his desire to kill drug dealers, saying that “the results will be incredible!” .....considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all. Last year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl. If China cracks down on this “horror drug,” using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/you-may-be-disappointed-mueller-report-n971601---split---WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans are waiting for Robert Mueller to give them the final word on whether the Trump campaign conspired with the 2016 Russian election interference effort — and whether their president is under the influence of a foreign adversary. Millions of Americans may be sorely disappointed. Unless Mueller files a detailed indictment charging members of the Trump campaign with conspiring with Russia, the public may never learn the full scope of what Mueller and his team has found — including potentially scandalous behavior that doesn't amount to a provable crime. The reason: The special counsel operates under rules that severely constrain how much information can be made public. Those rules require that the special counsel's report to the attorney general be "confidential." And, while the attorney general is required to notify Congress about Mueller's findings, the rules say those reports must amount to "brief notifications, with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them." "Expectations that we will see a comprehensive report from the special counsel are high. But the written regulations that govern the special counsel's reporting requirements should arguably dampen those expectations," said Chuck Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor and NBC News analyst. When Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr released the report of his investigation of President Bill Clinton in 1998, all of Washington paused to digest the 453-page document (plus 2,000 pages of appendixes), with its salacious details of the president's sexual dalliance with an intern. It was made public at the same time it was sent to Congress. The Mueller report won't be anything like that. Starr operated under the now-defunct independent counsel law, meaning he called many of his own shots, outside the purview of the Justice Department. Mueller is a special counsel under Justice Department supervision, subject to very specific regulations. Here is the sum total of what the rules say about a final report: "At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel." What's more, a 1999 document outlining that rule in the federal register criticizes the way in which independent counsel reports like Starr's were made public, saying that a public prosecutors report "provides an incentive to over-investigate, in order to avoid potential public criticism for not having turned over every stone, and creates potential harm to individual privacy interests." Memos explaining decisions not to prosecute can be long or short, and there is nothing in the rules to prevent Mueller from writing a 500-page narrative laying out the behavior of the Trump team with regard to Russia in excruciating detail. However, that report will go to the attorney general, and under the regulations, it is secret. The attorney general is required to send a report to Congress. But here is what the rule says about that: "To help ensure congressional and public confidence in the integrity of the process, the regulations impose on the Attorney General these reporting requirements to the Judiciary Committees of the Congress. These reports will occur on three occasions: on the appointment of a Special Counsel, on the Attorney General's decision to remove a Special Counsel, and on the completion of the Special Counsel's work. "These reports will be brief notifications, with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them." There is a wildcard — if the Mueller report contains allegations of potentially impeachable offenses against the president, scholars have said the Justice Department would have to pass the full details of that to Congress. But short of that, it's not clear Congress will get access to the evidence Mueller has gathered. Mueller has filed charges against 34 people and secured convictions of some of Trump's key former advisers. But none of the charges have accused anyone in Trumpworld of conspiring with the Russian intelligence operation to help Trump get elected in 2016. Nor has Mueller made any allegation that the president is compromised by Russia — a suspicion that percolates in part because of Trump's favorable behavior towards Vladimir Putin. What if Mueller has evidence of that, but not enough to prove a criminal case? Isn't the public entitled to know? The Democrats who now control the House have already made clear that they will do everything they can to ensure that Mueller's findings become public. They may well subpoena the confidential Mueller report to the attorney general. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation of the 2016 election, would also have an interest in gaining access to Mueller's findings and the evidence he has obtained. But the Justice Department may well resist those demands. Congress generally can't get access to information gathered by a grand jury, which by law is secret. And that may cover large swaths of the information Mueller has gathered. Other aspects of the report are likely to be classified or "law enforcement sensitive," a term of art for confidential information. Still other segments may be covered by executive privilege. What's more, a central principle of the U.S. justice system is that prosecutors don't pass public judgment on conduct unless they are doing so in a criminal filing. Former FBI Director James Comey was criticized for doing that in the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Multiple Justice Department and Congressional officials have told NBC News they expect a Mueller report to be sent over to the Justice Department in the next several weeks. When it lands, it's possible officials will publicly acknowledge receipt. And that will be it, until Attorney General William Barr decides how, if at all, he is going to make information public. Barr was asked about this many times at his confirmation hearing. And, as legal scholars Jack Goldsmith and Maddie McMahon pointed out in an article on Lawfare.com, Barr promised to make as much information public as he could. But he added an important qualifier: "consistent with current law." "Barr was remarkably — and, in our view, understandably — noncommittal in these statements," they write. "He reminded the senators of what the regulations say and noted that he would follow them. Barring the distinct possibility of a leak, Barr may play a crucial role in deciding how much of Mueller's findings become public. The rules governing the special counsel are internal rules that Barr could change. And they do not appear to constrain the attorney general from holding a news conference and discussing Mueller's report. But nothing Barr said during his confirmation hearing suggested he would do that. "Let's assume that Mr. Mueller at some point, hopefully soon, writes a report and that report will be given to you," Sen. John Kennedy asked him. "What happens next under the protocol rules and regulations at Justice?" Barr replied: "Well under the current rules, that report is supposed to be confidential and treated as, you know, the prosecution and declination documents in an ordinary—any other criminal case. And then, the attorney general as I understand the rules, would report to Congress about the conclusion of the investigation. I believe there may be discretion there about what the attorney general can put in that report." How Barr exercises that discretion may determine how much the public learns about what Robert Mueller knows.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-congress.html---split---Supported by On Washington By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON — Outraged House Republicans sued President Barack Obama in 2014 for spending billions of federal dollars without congressional approval — and won. Now many House and Senate Republicans could side with President Trump for doing what they saw as a grave abuse of power by Mr. Obama — circumventing an unwilling Congress in a spending dispute. The power of the purse is paramount for Congress. The constitutional edict that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law” gives Congress the upper hand over the executive branch when it comes to how federal funds are allocated and disbursed. The president can veto spending bills if he is dissatisfied, but is not supposed to rewrite them or defy Congress and spend money in ways it did not approve. Many in both parties now say that the presidential decision to act unilaterally and fund construction for a border wall via an emergency declaration would establish a dangerous new model, encouraging presidents thwarted by Congress to simply cite such a crisis to spend dollars however and wherever they pleased. “We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. Accepting the declaration would represent another weakening of the authority of Congress in a steady ceding of power to the executive branch — a trend that Republicans have said they want to reverse and that they railed against when Mr. Obama used executive orders to act on issues such as immigration and health care. “As I’ve said many times, I have concerns about the precedent that could be set with the use of emergency action to re-appropriate funds,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican in the Senate. Many other Republicans expressed similar reservations. But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who had suggested misgivings of his own, said he would back Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, as did others who said the president had no other option given the bipartisan spending compromise that denied him money for his coveted wall. “From Day 1, President Trump has made it clear he’s ready to address the crisis at the southern border, whether or not Congress works with him,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, a newly elected Republican from North Dakota. “While Democratic leadership has refused to tackle this issue, I stand with President Trump in favor of funding border security as we head into budget talks for the upcoming fiscal year.” That willingness to stand with the president at the expense of their own institution underscores that the border wall remains a powerful symbol with Republican voters and suggests Republicans would rather risk a troubling precedent than run afoul of Mr. Trump, who made the wall his signature campaign promise in 2016, and his constituency. It also shows how deeply lawmakers wanted to avoid another calamitous shutdown. But Republicans also fear that once Mr. Trump takes the emergency route, future Democratic presidents will follow suit and declare an emergency to deal with issues dear to their hearts, be it climate change, gun safety, immigration or health care. Republicans won’t be left with much room to complain should that happen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as much as she warned Republicans of the dangers of the president’s plan. “I’m not advocating for any president doing an end run around Congress,” she said. “I’m just saying that the Republicans should have some dismay about the door that they are opening, the threshold they are crossing.” Ms. Pelosi has a point. In the ever escalating partisan fights in Congress, the party that considers itself wronged by raw exercise of power typically seeks quick revenge when it has the opportunity to do so. Cases in point: the decision by Democrats in 2013 to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for filibusters on most nominations, the Republican blockade in 2016 against Judge Merrick B. Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court and the elimination in 2017 by Republicans of the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court nominations. In the Republican case against the Obama administration’s spending, a lawsuit initiated by John A. Boehner, the speaker at the time, claimed that the executive branch was spending more than $130 billion in subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that Congress had never agreed to spend. In a surprising decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of Federal District Court in Washington sided with Republicans and said that if the House could not sue to protect its appropriations power, it was in big trouble. “The House of Representatives as an institution would suffer a concrete, particularized injury if the executive were able to draw funds from the Treasury without a valid appropriation,” she wrote in her ruling. The case was later essentially made moot when Mr. Trump took over from Mr. Obama, but the ruling against the White House stood. The border wall case is somewhat different because the White House is using its declaration of an emergency as a justification for steering federal dollars to the wall against the wishes of Congress. But Democrats and some Republicans insist there is no emergency in the sense that the law was intended to cover. They say such action by the president would be an unmistakable defiance of Congress, which made its views evident in the spending legislation that did not provide the authority for the president to build the wall he wants. “Congressional intent on this issue is very clear,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “The president’s wall has been before Congress several times and has never garnered enough votes to even merit consideration. For the president to declare an emergency now would be an unprecedented subversion of Congress’s constitutional prerogative.” Like the health care dispute, the emergency declaration is virtually certain to end up in court and also be challenged in Congress. The president’s actions left many apprehensive about its future implications, particularly members of the Appropriations Committee. “I clearly have concerns about the idea that he can use an emergency declaration for this set of circumstances,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. “But let’s see what happens and how they do it.” “For the president to repurpose unilaterally billions of dollars that have been appropriated by Congress for specific needs undermines the role of Congress and is of dubious constitutionality,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. The president sees the emergency declaration as a way to get his way over a resistant Congress. But to many on Capitol Hill, it is the declaration itself that could become the emergency.

In his declaration of a national emergency on our southern border, President Trump recognized the Americans who experienced the consequences of that emergency firsthand: angel moms and dads. I never expected I would be one of them. My beautiful daughter, Mandy, was a 28-year-old sixth-grade teacher at Eastwood Heights Elementary School, and the center of our family. She was my world, she was my wife’s best friend and, most importantly, she was my baby girl. On the morning of November 22, 2018 — Thanksgiving Day — a man who should never have been in our country drank several beers before getting behind the wheel of a car. He blew through two red lights at an intersection, killed my daughter, and changed our lives forever. Surveillance footage shows that Mandy was using a crosswalk as she crossed the street. A witness described the sound of the impact as being so loud that he thought two vehicles had collided, not that a human being was struck. My daughter died on the spot. Read more commentary: Donald Trump's emergency declaration is an attack on democracy My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die. El Paso mayor: Despite Trump's State of the Union claim, our relations with Mexico thrive The man, Joel Velazquez, didn’t even stop to render aid. He kept driving, then abandoned the vehicle and lied to the police, telling them his vehicle had been stolen to try to avoid being arrested. Eventually, Velazquez admitted the truth. Mandy was so badly injured that the police initially wouldn't let me see her body. We were eventually told that her legs were broken in multiple places and she had multiple skull fractures and broken ribs. My beautiful daughter, torn to pieces. That’s something my family and I have to live with every single day. To makes things worse, shortly after Mandy’s funeral, we learned that the man who killed my daughter not only has an apparently criminal past, but was also in the country illegally. Dan Ferguson with his daughter, Mandy, at her wedding on June 21, 2014, in El Paso, Texas. (Photo11: Family handout) He was arrested in 2017 on suspicion of assault, but a judge released him on bond. When Mandy was killed, Velazquez was still out on bond and his assault case was pending in district court. Now, he’s been charged with manslaughter in the accident involving my daughter’s death and tampering with evidence. Unfortunately, cities like El Paso don’t enthusiastically support voluntarily assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in identifying criminal illegal immigrants. In the past, El Paso’s City Council has unanimously voted to challenge Texas’ legal ban on sanctuary cities. There are in fact hundreds of sanctuary jurisdictions around the country. How many cases are there similar to my daughter’s death? I have never been an especially political person, but Mandy is the reason I attended President Trump's rally in El Paso Monday night, and she is why I’m with the president 100 percent on the need for effective border security, including building a wall along the vulnerable areas on our southern border. The president was right to declare our border crisis a national emergency. While the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not violent criminals, they have all violated the laws which are in place to keep the American people safe. In the same city and at the same time that Trump was standing up for immigration enforcement, former Representative Robert O’Rourke, who was my congressman the day Mandy was killed, led an anti-wall rally. Days later, when O'Rourke was asked if he'd tear down the border wall separating El Paso, Texas, from Juárez, Mexico, he said, "Yes, absolutely. I'd take the wall down." Juárez is the birthplace of the man who killed Mandy. O'Rourke called his anti-wall the “March for Truth”. This is the truth: When our laws are broken, there are consequences, not just for the victims of crimes but also for the victims’ families. Mandy would not have been killed Thanksgiving morning by an illegal immigrant with a history of arrest if our immigration laws were enforced as they are written. After Mandy was killed, O’Rourke never bothered to reach out to my family; yet by welcoming my family and me as special guests to his rally, President Trump has given me the platform to ensure that Mandy didn’t die in vain. It won’t bring Mandy back, but it might prevent this from happening in the future. I hope the president’s efforts will convince Congress to finally do what is necessary to secure America’s borders, before another parent has to bury his or her child because partisan bickering kept politicians from doing what’s right to secure the safety of the American people.

But spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not provide details as a new round of talks is slated for next week in Washington. (Lintao Zhang/Getty Images file photo) The White House on Friday said “intensive” trade talks this week with Chinese officials yielded “progress,” but there was no indication President Donald Trump is ready to delay a substantial ballooning of tariffs on Chinese-made goods set to take effect March 1. “These detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “Much work remains, however.” The latter assessment reflects what top White House officials have said for months: on major issues like Chinese government subsidies to its firms, U.S. companies’ intellectual property rights and a handful of others, Beijing has never budged months during nearly two years of high-level talks. [Trump’s executive order will tap $6.6. billion in Pentagon, Treasury funds for wall, source says] This week’s round of talks in China, like others have focused on those issues and others like forced technology transfers demanded of U.S. companies, forced joint ventures, non-tariff barriers on agricultural and industrial goods, and cybersecurity matters. “It’s the same list,” a clearly frustrated White House chief economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told reporters in late November. “We haven’t seen much change.” Since, Kudlow and others have promised reporters new rounds of talks have yielded “progress,” but they decline to provide specifics. That language was back Friday, with the top White House spokeswoman saying “the United States looks forward to these further talks and hopes to see additional progress,” referring to a new round next week in Washington. Trump earlier this week said he would consider pushing back a deadline in just 14 days at which time U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods will swell from 10 percent to 25 percent if he thinks talks are moving toward a deal. But Sanders gave no indication Friday that he is ready to make that move, a sign he sees it as leverage for his team of negotiators. [Legal fight expected for Trump’s national emergency declaration] “Both sides will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the March 1, 2019, deadline for an increase in the 10 percent tariff on certain imported Chinese goods,” Sanders said. Lawmakers have both applauded the Trump administration for its tough stance on China’s trade practices and urged the president to resist an all-out trade war that could drive the American and global economies into a recession. Report language in the spending package Trump is slated to sign Friday morning tells the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office it “shall” create a process for businesses to seek tariff exemptions for imported products affected by U.S. duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods. The agency has said it would create an exemption process if U.S.-China trade talks fail, prompting the tariffs to increase to 25 percent. White House officials said earlier this month that any U.S.-China trade pact would not be required to get congressional approval, but they said they are keeping key lawmakers updated on the talks. Trump campaigned on getting tougher on Beijing in 2016, and brings it up at his political rallies as he gears up for a re-election fight. Ellyn Ferguson contributed to this report.

Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Newly sworn-in U.S. citizens rise from their seats during a 2018 naturalization ceremony in Alexandria, Va. Updated at 5:50 p.m. ET The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The decision grants the administration's request for an immediate review of a lower court's ruling that stopped plans for the question. A hearing is expected to be held in April. The question asks, "Is this person a citizen of the United States?" The Trump administration is locked in a legal battle with dozens of states, cities and other groups that do not want the question to appear on forms for the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the U.S. The Census Bureau has not asked all households about U.S. citizenship status in close to 70 years, although a sample of households have encountered a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey now known as the American Community Survey. For the 1950 head count, census workers asked where members of all households were born. If people were born outside the U.S., census workers asked whether they were naturalized citizens of the U.S. Citing Census Bureau research, the groups suing argue that asking about citizenship status will depress census participation among households with noncitizens. That could lead to an undercount of immigrants and communities of color, which would have major implications for the way political power and federal funding are shared over the next decade. Pressure is mounting to resolve all of these disputes by June so that the printing of paper questionnaires for the census can proceed as scheduled. Population counts from the census determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state receives. They also guide the distribution of an estimated $880 billion a year in federal tax dollars to states and local communities for Medicare, schools and other public services. The Supreme Court's decision comes a month after U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of New York ordered the administration to stop its plans to include the controversial question. Furman's decision for the two lead lawsuits based in Manhattan was the first major trial court ruling out of seven lawsuits over the Trump administration's decision to add the question to the census. The administration maintains that the Justice Department wants responses to the question to better enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. In his 277-page opinion, however, Furman concluded that was not the "real reason" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, approved including the question on the census. The judge found Ross' decision to be "arbitrary and capricious," in part because adding the question is less effective and more expensive than an alternative method the Census Bureau recommended to Ross — compiling existing government records on citizenship. Furman also said that Ross made a "veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut" violations of administrative law, including providing misleading statements about the citizenship question. Ross has said that the Justice Department "initiated" the request for the question. But court filings show that after discussing the question with Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Ross pressured his staff at the Commerce Department to get a formal request for the question from the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice, which is representing the administration in these lawsuits, said the department "looks forward to argument before the Supreme Court." "We are pleased that the Supreme Court has decided to hear this case defending the government's legal and reasonable decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census," said Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco in a written statement. "Adding a citizenship question to the census would cause incalculable damage to our democracy," said Dale Ho, one of the lead plaintiffs' attorneys at the ACLU, in a statement. "The evidence presented at trial exposed this was the Trump administration's plan from the get-go." "The District Court recognized these facts in ruling in favor of our challenge and we look forward to seeing the Trump Administration in court once again," said New York State Attorney General Letitia James, whose office represented some of the lead plaintiffs in district court under her predecessor. In an unusual move, the Trump administration's attorneys appealed Furman's ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before asking the Supreme Court to bypass the 2nd Circuit and take on reviewing the decision earlier. Besides the two lead lawsuits in New York, district judges are hearing citizenship question cases in California, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Internal documents released as part of the lawsuits reveal that the Trump administration had prepared to defend adding a citizenship question in the country's highest court. "Since this issue will go to the Supreme Court we need to be diligent in preparing the administrative record," Commerce Department official Earl Comstock wrote in a 2017 email to Ross. "We should be very careful, about everything, whether or not it is likely to end up in the SC," Ross replied. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---8.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ann-coulter-trump-national-emergency_n_5c66f56ee4b01757c36b4d99---split---President Donald Trump’s former hardline supporter Ann Coulter is continuing to turn on him, slamming his national emergency declaration as a way to “scam the stupidest people in his base.” Coulter, who some have speculated influenced Trump’s decision to stand firm in his demands for border wall funding last December as the federal government spiraled into a shutdown, has been visibly furious with the president ever since he backed down. In two posts on Twitter Friday, the right-winger claimed Trump’s latest move was all for show: No, the goal of a national emergency is for Trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years. https://t.co/6DQSkqxV8h The goal is to get Trump's stupidest voters to say "HE'S FIGHTING!" No he's not. If he signs this bill, it's over. https://t.co/6DQSkqxV8h Asked Friday about the power of conservative media over his decision-making, Trump claimed not to know Coulter, much to the surprise of many Twitter users who reacted in astonishment and amusement on the social media platform. Aside from Coulter, a handful of Trump’s Fox News allies initially expressed frustration with the congressional deal on border security, which the president intends to sign. On Monday night shortly after the agreement was announced, Sean Hannity trashed it as a “garbage compromise” and Laura Ingraham called it “pathetic.” Lou Dobbs echoed the disapproval, tweeting that it was “an insult to @POTUS and the American people.” The proposal will give the president $1.375 billion for his border wall while slashing the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds by roughly 17 percent. Trump plans to get ahold of billions more in border funding with his national emergency.
---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/supreme-court-census-citizenship.html---split---Supported by By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation. The court’s move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term. The justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The federal government has long gathered information about citizenship, but since 1950, it has not included a question on it in the forms sent once a decade to each household. Last month, a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question, saying that the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed. The Supreme Court stepped in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter, and it put the case on an unusually fast track. The Supreme Court’s speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline — the census forms are set to be printed in June. Without immediate action from the court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, told the justices, “the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population.” The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for late April, and it is expected to rule before the end of June. The case — United States Department of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966 — is the latest test of the scope of executive power in the Trump era. Last year, the justices upheld President Trump’s authority to restrict travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. More recently, the court rejected the administration’s request to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern border illegally On Friday, Mr. Trump said he expected his declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall to be challenged in court. He predicted that the administration would lose in the lower courts but prevail in the Supreme Court. The census case has its roots in the text of the Constitution, which requires an “actual enumeration” every 10 years, with the House of Representatives to be apportioned based on “the whole number of persons in each state.” “By its terms, therefore, the Constitution mandates that every 10 years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the United States, whether citizen or noncitizen, whether living here with legal status or without,” Judge Jesse M. Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote last month in his decision, setting out the consensus view. Critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms. By one government estimate, about 6.5 million people might decide not to participate. That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending. Judge Furman found that were the question added, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would risk losing seats in the House and that several states could lose federal money. Dale Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the addition of the citizenship question, said that it “would cause incalculable damage to our democracy.” “The evidence presented at trial exposed this was the Trump administration’s plan from the get-go,” Mr. Ho said. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has said that he ordered the question to be added in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department, which said that data about citizenship would help it enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In a detailed decision after an eight-day trial, Judge Furman concluded that Mr. Ross had dissembled, saying that “the evidence is clear that Secretary Ross’s rationale was pretextual.” “While the court is unable to determine — based on the existing record, at least — what Secretary Ross’s real reasons for adding the citizenship question were, it does find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that promoting enforcement of the” Voting Rights Act, or V.R.A., “was not his real reason for the decision,” Judge Furman wrote. “Instead, the court finds that the V.R.A. was a post hoc rationale for a decision that the secretary had already made for other reasons.” Judge Furman had called for Mr. Ross to be questioned under oath, but the Supreme Court blocked that order in October. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the court should have gone further, shutting down all pretrial fact-gathering in the census case. Justice Gorsuch added that there was no indication of bad faith in Mr. Ross’s conduct. “There’s nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape,” Justice Gorsuch wrote at the time. “Of course, some people may disagree with the policy and process. But until now, at least, this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretary’s motives.” In November, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to halt the trial, over the dissents of Justices Thomas, Gorsuch and Samuel A. Alito Jr. In his ruling last month, Judge Furman relied on evidence in the so-called administrative record, meaning the materials the government said Mr. Ross had considered before making his decision. Evidence presented at the trial showed that Mr. Ross had wanted to add the question long before the request from the Justice Department. The letter from the Justice Department, Judge Furman wrote, was an attempt “to launder their request through another agency — that is, to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made.” Documents disclosed in the case showed that Mr. Ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and an architect of the Trump administration’s tough policies against immigrants, and that Mr. Ross had met at Mr. Bannon’s direction with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration. “In a startling number of ways,” Judge Furman wrote, “Secretary Ross’s explanations for his decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency.” Judge Furman ruled that the administration had violated federal statutes. But he rejected a constitutional challenge based on equal protection principles, saying that there was not enough evidence in the record to conclude that Mr. Ross had intended to discriminate against minorities and unauthorized immigrants. The lawsuit challenging the addition of the question was filed by New York, other states, localities and advocacy groups. They said that asking the question was a calculated effort by the administration to discriminate against immigrants. “Adding a question about citizenship to the census would incite widespread fear in immigrant communities and greatly impair the accuracy of population counts,” Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, said on Friday after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. In urging the Supreme Court to review Judge Furman’s decision, Mr. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, wrote that Mr. Ross had wide discretion over the census that could not be second-guessed by courts. He added that questions about citizenship have often been asked of at least a sample of the population in many earlier censuses and are commonplace in ones conducted by other developed democracies.

By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. This editorial was updated. With his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, President Trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights. The damage to American democracy threatens to linger long after his administration is no more than a dank memory. Cornered into accepting a budget deal that lacked the $5.7 billion in border-wall funding he demanded, the president could not handle being labeled a loser by conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. His solution: Sign the bill while simultaneously declaring a national emergency that, at least in his mind, would allow him to shift funds and order the military to start building his wall. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced the move on Thursday afternoon. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” she said. To repeat: The influx of migrant families at the southern border does not constitute a national security crisis, much less a bona fide emergency. There is, at this point, a worsening humanitarian crisis, actively fueled by the draconian policies of the administration. But the suffering on display requires thoughtful policy adjustments, not a steel monstrosity. Not that this is the end of this battle. Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration is destined to wind up in the courts, where it could get bogged down indefinitely. This fit of presidential pique is about more than a wall. It constitutes a reordering of the power dynamic between the branches of government. Mr. Trump aims to usurp one of Congress’s most basic responsibilities, the power of the purse. Confronted with this power grab, every lawmaker should be bellowing in alarm. Until recently, the threat of an “imperial presidency” was of grave constitutional concern to Republicans, who spent much of President Barack Obama’s tenure accusing him of misusing executive authority on, among other matters, immigration, health care and the environment. To their credit, a few Republican lawmakers have been warning against an emergency declaration for weeks. “I believe the president does have the legal authority — if you read the statute. I also think it would be a poor use of that authority,” Representative David Schweikert, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Politico in January. Senator Marco Rubio was more emphatic. “If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.” The reaction of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Mr. Trump’s intentions will do nothing to calm Republican jitters. “Just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people,” she observed. The poison cherry atop this sundae is that Mr. Trump is subverting American democracy for a cause opposed by a majority of the public. Polls show that most Americans do not want a wall at the southern border. And most definitely do not approve of Mr. Trump’s faking a national emergency to make an end run around Congress. Two recent polls showed that two-thirds of Americans opposed it. Not that any of this seems of interest to the president. “I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” he insisted to reporters last month, sounding more like a huffy kindergartner than a world leader. This administration is forever coming up with creative new ways to disturb and dismay the nation. Mr. Trump’s eagerness to undermine the Constitution to serve his short-term political gain remains among the most outrageous.

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60 BEDFORD, N.H. – William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor who ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016, became the first Republican to take a serious step toward challenging President Donald Trump in 2020. Speaking Friday at a breakfast in New Hampshire, Weld said he has created a presidential exploratory committee. He blasted Trump for leaving the nation in “grave peril.” “We have a president whose priorities are skewed towards promotion of himself rather than for the good of the country,” Weld said. “He may have great energy and considerable raw talent but he does not use that in ways that promote democracy, truth, justice and equal opportunity for all. To compound matters, our president is simply too unstable to carry out the duties of the highest executive office in the land.” The move makes Trump the first incumbent president since George H.W. Bush in 1992 to face a notable primary challenge. Other Republicans eyeing a presidential campaign include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Libertarian vice presidential candidate William Weld speaks at a rally Sept. 10, 2016, in New York. (Photo11: Bryan R. Smith, AFP/Getty Images) More: Who is running for president? Here's a list of the candidates who have declared so far Trump remains popular with Republicans so faces little risk in losing the GOP nomination. But primary challenges often foreshadow trouble ahead for incumbent presidents. Bush and Jimmy Carter lost their bids for a second term after facing challenges from inside their own party. Asked to comment on Weld’s campaign, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders responded: “Who?” Stephen Stepanek, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, pointed to Weld’s past support of President Barack Obama and said he didn’t “expect his campaign to get very far among Republican primary voters. “The Republican Party is a big tent, but someone who endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 as the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee really needs to think about how welcome he is in the Republican Party,” Stepanek said in a statement. Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, the 73-year-old Weld ran on the Libertarian party ticket in 2016 with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, receiving about 4.5 million votes, or a little more than 3 percent of the national popular vote. Despite a pledge to libertarians that he would remain loyal to the party going forward, Weld on Jan. 17 walked into the clerk’s office of the Massachusetts town where he lives and re-registered with the GOP, adding to speculation that he would challenge Trump in the primaries. Weld has not won a political race since being re-elected governor by a landslide in his heavily Democratic state in 1994. He was first elected to the office in 1990, defeating a conservative Democratic candidate, and quickly became one of Massachusetts’ most popular governors in recent history. While holding the line on spending and taxes, Weld as governor embraced liberal positions at odds with national Republicans on abortion and gay rights. His low-key style and sharp wit also seemed to play well with voters as did his penchant for the unexpected: He once ended a news conference touting progress in cleaning up Boston’s polluted Charles River by diving fully clothed into the waterway. After winning a second term, Weld’s attention appeared to drift away the governor’s office and toward other political pursuits. He briefly entertained a run for president in 1996 before mounting an unsuccessful campaign that year to unseat Democratic Sen. John Kerry. He resigned as governor the following year after then-President Bill Clinton nominated him to be ambassador to Mexico, but it was a post he would never hold. Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina refused to schedule a hearing on the nomination, claiming among other things that Weld’s support for medical marijuana and needle exchange programs for drug users disqualified him from serving in Mexico because of that country’s history of drug trafficking. Weld fired back at Helms, suggesting it was un-American for Helms to refuse to hold a public hearing on a high-profile ambassadorial nomination. Weld left the public arena but later moved to New York, where he would make a brief, unsuccessful bid to become the first person since Sam Houston to serve as governor of two different states. Upon returning to Massachusetts, he joined ML Strategies, the lobbying arm of the high-powered law firm of Mintz Levin. He consulted for Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn during a regulatory process that in 2014 resulted in Wynn’s then-company being awarded a coveted license to operate the state’s only Boston-area casino.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/mcconnell-trump-will-sign-spending-bill-declare-national-emergency---split---President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrive for lunch with Senate Republicans in the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2018. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) The big bipartisan government funding deal is going to become law, but it will be far from the end of the border security battle between President Donald Trump and members of Congress. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Thursday that Trump intends to sign the spending conference report, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had indicated earlier. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” she said in a statement. “The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.” Confirmation from the White House spokeswoman came after McConnell said Trump had told him he would sign the conference report into law, along with the emergency declaration. Watch: What is a national emergency? How Congress gave the White House broad, far-reaching powers “I had an opportunity to speak with President Trump and he, I would say to all my colleagues, has indicated he's prepared to sign the bill,” the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor. “He also will be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. I indicated I’m going to support the national emergency declaration.” With the assurances that Trump would put his signature on the appropriations package, the Senate quickly moved ahead, adopting the conference report on an 83-16 vote. Following the McConnell announcement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed that the $333 billion, seven-bill appropriations package to finish off fiscal 2019, would also move ahead in the House later Thursday. “We’ll vote on it later today,” the California Democrat said of the fiscal 2019 appropriations package. “So that’s real progress for us to have left it to the appropriators to make the decisions.” Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans “It’s gonna pass,” House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn said of the omnibus spending package. “I hope it would be a strong bipartisan vote, [that] is what I would like to see.” The South Carolina Democrat said he had been in contact with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana about this evening’s vote. “So the two of us are working together, trying to come up with a strong bipartisan vote for this bill. It will pass. I would hate to predict how many he will have, I think I know about how many I have on this side,” Clyburn said. Lindsey McPherson and Doug Sword contributed to this report.

Andrew Harnik/AP hide caption During his State of the Union speech this month, President Trump reiterated his call for funding of a wall to block unauthorized migration across the Southern border. After weeks of brandishing the threat of invoking a national emergency, President Trump is going ahead and declaring one. "President Trump will sign the government funding bill," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Thursday afternoon, "and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border." Trump had earlier declared his unhappiness with the $1.375 billion that Congress is providing for a border barrier in a spending bill that keeps the government operating through the end of September. That outlay is less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion Trump had sought for a wall along the border with Mexico. By declaring a national emergency at the same time he signs the legislation keeping the government open, Trump is aiming to amass additional funding for that wall from what acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has called "pots of money" in federal agencies. A possible source for fattening border wall funding would be the billions of dollars appropriated this year for military construction. A 1982 law empowers the secretary of defense to redirect military construction funds during a presidentially declared national emergency. But tapping money meant for building military housing or improving safety on bases could be problematic. "You can use military construction funding under a national emergency, but it actually stipulates that that has to be for a military purpose, and it would be hard to justify this, I think, is a military purpose," says military budget expert Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "So if [Trump] did that, he's likely to end up with a court challenge, which could forestall the whole thing for months or even years." NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor
---split---8.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/14/more-people-around-the-world-see-u-s-power-and-influence-as-a-major-threat-to-their-country/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By John Gramlich and Kat Devlin A growing share of people around the world see U.S. power and influence as a “major threat” to their country, and these views are linked with attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the United States as a whole, according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 22 nations since 2013. A median of 45% across the surveyed nations see U.S. power and influence as a major threat, up from 38% in the same countries during Trump’s first year as president in 2017 and 25% in 2013, during the administration of Barack Obama. The long-term increase in the share of people who see American power as a threat has occurred alongside declines in the shares of people who say they have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs and who have a favorable view of the United States. (For more about global views toward the U.S. president and the country he leads, see “Trump’s International Ratings Remain Low, Especially Among Key Allies.”) Despite these changes, U.S. power and influence still ranks below other perceived threats around the world. Considerably larger shares of people point to global climate change (seen as a major threat by a median of 67%), the Islamic militant group known as ISIS (cited by 62%) and cyberattacks (cited by 61%). U.S. power and influence, in fact, is not seen as the top threat in any of the countries surveyed.  Still, in 18 of the 22 countries, there were statistically significant increases in the share of people who see American power and influence as a major threat between 2013 and 2018. That includes increases of 30 percentage points in Germany, 29 points in France, and 26 points in Brazil and Mexico. And while these shares rose substantially in many countries after Trump’s election, they increased further in several nations between Trump’s first and second year in office. In Germany and France, for instance, the share of people who see U.S. power and influence as a major threat went up by 14 and 13 percentage points, respectively, between 2017 and 2018. Other notable year-over-year increases occurred in Tunisia (11 points), Canada and Argentina (8 points each), South Africa (7 points) and Brazil and Russia (6 points each). Other nations bucked this trend, however. In Spain, for example, the share of people who see American power as a major threat fell by 17 points between 2017 and 2018 (from 59% to 42%). Still, people in Spain remain much more likely to see the U.S. as a threat today than in 2013. Overall, there are 10 nations surveyed where roughly half or more now see U.S. power as a major threat, with the biggest shares saying this in South Korea (67%), Japan (66%) and Mexico (64%). In South Korea, equal shares point to U.S. power and influence and to North Korea’s nuclear program as a major threat to their nation (each is cited by 67% of the public). However, several other perceived threats to South Koreans outrank U.S. power and influence, including global climate change (named by 86% of South Koreans), China’s power and influence (cited by 82%), cyberattacks from other countries (cited by 81%) and the condition of the global economy (cited by 74%). South Koreans have long perceived American power as a major threat to their country: 66% said this in 2013 and 70% said it in 2017. In many of the surveyed countries, concerns about American power and influence are connected with views of Trump: People who have little or no confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs are more likely than those who have confidence in Trump to see U.S. power and influence as a top threat to their country. This includes several longtime U.S. allies, including Canada, the UK and Australia. The same pattern appears when it comes to views of the U.S. in general, as opposed to its president. In most surveyed nations, people who have a more unfavorable view of the U.S. are also more likely to say that American power and influence is a threat to their nation.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-national-emergency-didnt-need_n_5c66e76ce4b05c889d1ed6bf---split---President Donald Trump on Friday admitted that he “didn’t need to” declare a national emergency for his long-promised border wall, and merely wanted to “do it much faster” to please his political base. A number of legal experts — including George Conway, husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway — immediately noted on Twitter that those words could easily be used against him in the likely legal battle over his questionable claim to a national emergency. This quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every complaint filed this afternoon. https://t.co/ClHQhpTaEe Hours after Trump’s announcement, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) announced a lawsuit against the Department of Justice “because the government has so far failed” to explain why the wall could be considered a national emergency. Trump openly acknowledged the possibility of lawsuits during his remarks Friday, predicting that he would lose in the lower courts. It would not be the first time Trump’s words have been used against him in court. The ACLU, which has frequently sued Trump and his administration, announced Friday it would file a lawsuit “early next week” challenging Trump’s decision. “This is a patently illegal power grab that hurts American communities and flouts the checks and balances that are hallmarks of our democracy,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said. Omar Jadwat, the director of ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project, urged the president to “keep talking” in a tweet posted during Trump’s remarks. keep talking mr president Following his announcement Friday, Trump is heading to his golf club in Florida for the weekend, further underscoring the dubious nature of his “national emergency.” This story has been updated to note lawsuits from CREW and the ACLU.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/language-euphemisms-trump.html---split---Supported by Language has been neutralized when it should state the obvious. By Timothy Egan Contributing Opinion Writer You could always slight the very rich by calling them moneybags, robber barons, fat cats or plutocrats. Billionaire was a neutral word, grounded in math: Such a person could spend $10 million a year, for 100 years, before the pile was gone. Then came Howard Schultz, a billionaire times two, insisting that people not use the B-word in describing him. Better to refer to the 540 Americans in his sensitive class as “people of means.” For this he was roundly mocked, and rightly so. The pushback to the pusher of our favorite South American drug is a fair start. But there is much more to clean up. For we live in a time when language has been weaponized for high crimes and petty cruelties, while neutralized when it should state the obvious. Democracy may die in darkness, as the slogan of a rival newspaper has it, but it also slips away under cover of euphemism. You can date it to Republican repackaging of the estate tax as a “death tax,” or tax cuts for the rich morphing into “tax relief” for the overly burdened. And were French fries really “freedom fries” during a spasm of faux-patriotism? Maybe the food marketers started us down this road when “natural” was slapped onto any label — turpentine, for example, which also happens to be gluten-free. Or Big Pharma, using “wellness” to describe treatment by drugs with names from a dance party: Lyrica, Celebrex, and then the Cialis gets passed around. All of that can be excused as framing to get an advantage. The Democrats are doing it now with the Green New Deal and Medicare for All — both of which sound pleasantly pie-in-the-sky and historically resonant until you look at the details, which their sponsors didn’t bother to do. The most egregious of political language fraud, as George Orwell noted in his seminal essay on the subject, is used for “the defense of the indefensible.” To that end, the Trump administration has been a fount of criminal circumlocution. We all know about “alternative facts” and “truth isn’t truth” and “fake news” — used by the administration to describe reality. But less attention has been paid to this government’s description of cages for young children separated from their parents. The Trump administration has invented “tender age” shelters to defend the indefensible. It sounds so caring. And Trump is downgrading “national emergency” from something that comes with a siren for a soundtrack to just another term for cheap political expediency. It used to be a big deal for a reputable news organization to flat out call the president a liar. Now, liar must be the most-used descriptor linked to this president. It’s also the right word. But “liar” has lost its sting, because Trump clearly doesn’t care about telling the truth. As a journalist, I’d get in more trouble if I said the president is fat — my bad, I mean plus-sized. The word “socialist” is back in play. This term also used to sting, evoking Cold War authoritarians and empty store shelves. That was true then. What’s true now is that socialist “has lost its meaning,” especially among millennials, as Peter Buttigieg, the young presidential aspirant and mayor of South Bend, Ind., said. If used to describe help for the elderly, subsidized college or affordable health care, socialist is a net plus. If it implies total government control without choice, it’s a loser. We’ve only just begun the modern reframing of this power word. At the White House, “executive time” is the bogus term for the majority of the president’s day spent watching Fox News hosts praise him, tweeting insults or playing virtual golf in the new room-sized simulator just installed in the house where Lincoln slept. Kramer did more work in the “Seinfeld” episode where he pretended to have a job. The border “wall” is a “complexifier,” to use the odd word that multibillionaire Jeff Bezos introduced, but also central to Trumpian Newspeak. The wall doesn’t exist, not in the form Trump has described it — “a great, great wall” made of “hardened concrete.” And yet, it’ll soon be finished. How so? In a masterstroke of up-is-down, Trump’s rally in El Paso this week switched the “Build the Wall” slogan of his cult to “Finish the Wall.” As my colleagues at Upshot showed, Trump keeps weaseling out of his wall promise by changing the wording — a fence, a barrier, some German shepherds. The language is crucial here, because it’s the central lie of his presidency. Like Schultz, Trump wants to use his own verbal wallpaper to cover the truth.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/democrats-will-push-back-on-national-emergency-in-congress-and-courts-pelosi-schumer-say---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats will push back against the president's national emergency declaration in Congress, the courts and the public. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer promise that Democrats in Congress — hopefully joined by some Republicans — will push back against President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration in multiple arenas. “The President’s actions clearly violate the Congress’ exclusive power of the purse, which our founders enshrined in the Constitution,” the duo said in a joint statement Friday. “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.” Pelosi and Schumer did not provide specifics regarding the actions they’ll take. But there’s already talk of the House passing a resolution of disapproval, rejecting the emergency declaration. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, presidents can take extraordinary actions in times of crisis by declaring a national emergency. A joint resolution disapproving of action under the 1976 law would be considered “privileged” and can be passed with a simple majority vote in each chamber. The privileged status of such a resolution would allow Senate Democrats to force a floor vote over objections of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Thursday he supports Trump’s decision. During a Rose Garden announcement Friday, Trump said he would sign a national emergency declaration stating there’s a crisis at the southern border. He plans to shift $3.5 billion from the Defense Department’s military construction fund to the border barrier project. “The President’s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process.” The Democratic leaders’ promise that Congress will respond in the courts comes as no surprise to the administration. Trump said Friday he expects to get sued and even to get an initial “bad ruling,” but he expressed confidence the Supreme Court will uphold his declaration. Democrats are likely to coordinate legal action with states and local governments — and potentially, outside interest groups —that will want to sue Trump over the declaration. “The president’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our founders’ vision,” Pelosi and Schumer said. Some Republicans have said they do not support Trump using an emergency declaration to go around Congress. But it’s unclear whether they feel strongly enough to get involved in any court action, or to support a resolution of disapproval. Pelosi and Schumer are hoping they will, saying, “We call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution. Just as both parties honored our oath to protect the American people by passing the conference committee bill, the Congress on a bipartisan basis must honor the Constitution by defending our system of checks and balances.” The Democratic leaders’ statement focused on Trump’s national emergency declaration. It was not immediately clear if they will also seek to challenge his authority to use other executive actions to shift additional money toward the border barrier project. The Trump administration is planning actions that would divert $2.5 billion from the Pentagon’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury Department drug forfeiture program. White House officials said Friday those funds will “back-filled” in Trump’s fiscal 2020 budget request. John T. Bennett, David Lerman and Niels Lewsniewski contributed to this report.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/author/matt-bai---split---Pete Buttigieg would rather talk about his record as the two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind., than about his identity as the first openly gay man to seek the Democratic nomination. Our developer president could have focused his energy on building airports, high-speed rail lines and high-tech schools. But he can only think of one place to sink a shovel, and that’s turning out to be the sinkhole of his administration. Howard Schultz is one of very few people on the planet who had the vision to transform the way we live. He saw where the culture was headed and figured out a way to get ahead of it. No one in politics is doing that. The question facing former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, if he decides to run against Trump, is this: Do you try to take out the incumbent president in the primaries, or do you make an independent bid instead? President Trump doesn’t think our defense of democratic values really works for America anymore, and in this he has more in common with Vladimir Putin than he does with his own Cabinet or his military. In Trump’s America, taking personal responsibility for anything you say or do is suddenly out of vogue, no matter which side you’re on or how petty the issue. Back in 2015, I sat down with President Obama, during a visit to Nike’s Oregon campus, to talk about the huge Asian trade pact he was trying to sell. It was what Obama said that day about Elizabeth Warren, who had become a vocal critic of the trade deal, that landed like a grenade. What crude and awful The contrast to focus on in 2020 isn’t just right versus left. It’s short term versus long term. It’s quarterly returns versus a half century of peril. When Trump flouts the conventions of the office, he’s winning with his core voters. It doesn’t matter what he’s saying — what matters is that he’s making the rest of us howl in indignation. It was hard to watch George H.W. Bush’s funeral proceedings this week and not wonder how Donald Trump’s last farewell will someday compare. A few of the Democratic Party’s young stars in the House took on Nancy Pelosi this week and proved mainly that none of them have anything like the political acumen to replace her. In a movie where virtually all the characters live in a gray zone of morality, should the journalists be exempt? Do we have to choose between defending ourselves from a demagogue and reckoning with our role in having created him? By any historical measure, the Democrats had a pretty great night Tuesday, and the president’s party did not. Donald Trump calls himself a “nationalist.” You needn’t be a racist to believe that national identity and borders matter. Trump makes no pretense of balancing moral imperatives, or even military objectives, against the economic agenda that is his only real priority. The Supreme Court hearings are starting to feel less like the #MeToo movement and more like ruinous politics, Matt Bai says. The fact is that at this elite level of the American judiciary, everybody's smart. But not everybody's good, Matt Bai writes. Trump’s safe choice for the high court has become the last thing he and the GOP needed so close to midterms, Matt Bai writes. Ten years ago last month, I wrote a long cover story for the New York Times Magazine titled: “Is Obama the End of Black Politics?” The central point of the essay, which featured dozens of black leaders and provoked no shortage of debate, was that Barack Obama’s nomination in 2008 marked a turning point Trump’s aides say it’s their duty to protect the president from himself, even if that means stealing papers off his desk.
---split---10.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lawsuit-national-emergency_n_5c65dc88e4b05c889d1d51a7---split---The first lawsuits challenging the legality of President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration began rolling in on Friday, and lawmakers say more are likely to follow. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington came out the gate first with a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Justice failed to provide documents concerning the president’s legal authority to invoke emergency powers over a border wall. “Americans deserve to know the true basis for President Trump’s unprecedented decision to enact emergency powers to pay for a border wall,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. “We’re suing because the government has so far failed to produce the requested documents or provide an explanation for their delay.” The announcement came the same day Trump confirmed he will use the declaration to divert about $3.6 billion the Defense Department had allocated for construction projects and $2.5 billion earmarked for counterdrug activities in order to fund his long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border ― a project Congress refused to fully fund in the spending bill it passed Thursday. The American Civil Liberties Union announced Friday that it will file a lawsuit early next week arguing that Trump cannot legally use the emergency declaration to evade those funding limits imposed by Congress. “The Constitution assigns Congress the power of the purse, and no prior president has ever tried to use emergency powers to fund a chosen project — particularly a permanent, large-scale domestic project such as this — against congressional will,” Dror Ladin, staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement. “This is obviously improper.” Other lawsuits are likely to follow. In a press conference on Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Attorney General Xavier Becerra said they are planning to sue after reviewing the declaration. “Donald Trump, we’ll see you in court,” the governor said. Becerra said they are “working closely with several other states that feel the same way,” hinting at a multistate legal effort. Democrats in Congress have also signaled they’re ready to go to court. Soon after Trump’s announcement Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) issued a joint statement, saying, “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.” Plenty of past presidents have declared national emergencies ― something Trump has cited to normalize his plans ― but it’s unprecedented for a president to declare one as a means of bypassing Congress to pay for a project lawmakers won’t endorse. Given the extraordinary nature of Trump’s plan ― not to mention the extraordinary nature of his presidency ― legal scholars have raised concerns that Trump could take advantage of a national emergency declaration and expand its scope far beyond his border wall. In December, the Brennan Center for Justice identified 123 different statutory powers that may become available to Trump in the event he declares a national emergency. Those include letting the federal government seize private vessels at sea, assuming control of internet traffic, deploying the military as a domestic police force and dozens of other actions unrelated to the national emergency he’s claiming. Others have pointed out the dangerous precedent set by a president invoking emergency powers to make good on a campaign promise. “What is particularly troubling here is the idea that the president and administration officials seem to be trying to manufacture an emergency in order to achieve a political goal,” Brookings Institution legal scholar Margaret Taylor said in a Q&A with Vice News last month Sanjana Karanth contributed reporting.

Here are some of the most eye-opening moments from President Donald Trump's teleprompter-free emergency declaration announcement-turned-Rose Garden news conference: After declaring that he was using his national emergency powers to build his wall on the southern border, Trump broke out into a singsongy rap about what he expected to happen next, which would include appeals to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against his travel ban in 2017. "We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn't be there, and we'll possibly get a bad ruling and then we'll get another bad ruling and then we'll end up the Supreme Court, and then hopefully we'll get a fair shake and we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban. They sued us in the 9th Circuit and then we lost ... " The president expressed his admiration for Chinese President Xi Jinping's approach to drug crimes. He recounted a conversation with Xi, where he said: "You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem. Why?" He then did an impression of Xi saying: "Death penalty. We give death penalty to people who sell drugs. End of problem." "What do we do? We set up blue-ribbon committees, lovely men and women, they sit around a table, eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time," Trump said. "Their criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called how about a fine," he complained. In December, Trump signed a criminal justice reform act that reduced mandatory penalties for some drug offenses. He said Xi was adding fentanyl to his country's "criminal list" thanks to ongoing trade negotiations. The "penalty is death. That's frankly one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal," Trump said. The president said the wall was necessary to stop the flow of illegal drugs from the Mexico, saying "the big drug loads don't go through ports of entry." He was asked later about the claim, which contradicts statistics from his own administration. A 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment by the DEA, Mexican drug cartels "transport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers." "I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster," he said. Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize for getting North Korea to stop flying "rocket ships" over Japan. "In fact, I think I can say this, Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. He said: 'I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.' I said, 'Thank you.' "We do a lot of good work. This administration does a tremendous job and we don’t get credit for it. So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean it’s the most beautiful five-page letter, Nobel Prize, he sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan, and they had alarms going off — you know that. Now all of the sudden they feel good, they feel safe. I did that." On the benefits of the wall, Trump said: "One of the things we'd save tremendous, just a tremendous amount on, would be sending the military. If we had a wall we don’t need the military, because we'd have a wall! So I'm going to be signing a national emergency, and it’s been signed many times before." Trump insisted conservative commentators don't decide policy for him, pushing back against reports that he shut down the government at their behest. But he went on to praise several of his favorites. "Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do, not of me," Trump said of the Fox News personality he reportedly speaks to often. "If I changed my views, he wouldn't be with me," the president insisted. "Rush Limbaugh, I think he is a great guy," he said. "He can speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. ... I mean this guy is unbelievable." He also singled out Fox personalities Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, before talking about Ann Coulter. Coulter wrote a book called "In Trump We Trust" before turning on him for his failure to build the wall. “Probably, if I did speak to her, she would be very nice, but I just don’t have time to speak to her,” he said. But for now, said the president who's come under fire for making Native American cracks about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Coulter "is off the reservation."

---split---10.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/munich-trump-europe-iran.html---split---Supported by It's no longer worth pretending Trump is not in the authoritarian camp. The shock has passed. European powers are thinking again. By Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist MUNICH — If the Munich Security Conference had a soul it was embodied in Senator John McCain, always an invigorating presence here and always a fierce advocate of the trans-Atlantic alliance. He’s gone now and so is the idea of inevitable liberal democratic convergence, replaced by great power competition in the age of the strongman. The meeting comes hard on the heels of a strange gathering in Warsaw — yes, Warsaw — convened by the United States and devoted to “Peace and Security in the Middle East.” It might better have been called “Pipe Dreams on the Vistula” or “Trump’s America Bashes Europe.” At the Warsaw conference, Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Germany, France and Britain for trying “to break American sanctions” against Iran. He seemed as incensed by Europe’s malign behavior as by Iran’s — a curious case of the United States aiding Vladimir Putin’s divisive agenda in Europe. The truth is that the Trump Administration broke the Iran nuclear agreement, undermining America’s word, whose value has declined around the world as sharply as Iran’s rial currency over the last 18 months. Germany, France and Britain believe in the evidence that the nuclear agreement is working, with the Islamic Republic in compliance. The accord was never supposed to transform Iran overnight or sprinkle fairy dust on the Middle East. It was meant to keep Iran from going nuclear. It’s doing that. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a hapless mission to shape Trump’s caprices into policy, declared, “You can’t achieve peace and stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran.” He has this upside down. Peace and stability in the Middle East are impossible without Iran. The Islamic Republic is too big and too influential to shut out. It’s not going anywhere. To say this is not to advocate appeasement. Iran, 40 years after its revolution, is beset by internal contradictions and is predatory abroad. It is to recognize that, as with Europe’s successful Ostpolitik during the Cold War, engagement with a rival power may be the best way to change that power and defuse confrontation. Behind the nuclear deal lay this conviction. It is inscribed in postwar Germany’s DNA. German-American relations are now at a low point. Multilateralism was not just a policy for postwar Germany. It was a core belief. In the construction of a rules-based world order anchored by international organizations, including the European Union and NATO, lay the assurance that history could not repeat itself. Trump has never encountered a multilateralism he does not loathe. The world, for his administration, is a place where rivals “compete for advantage.” The president is for muscular unilateralism in a Hobbesian world — except he hasn’t heard of Hobbes. Global community is pie in the sky; Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, a lost cause. The relationship anchoring the world that the Munich Security Conference sought to buttress has been drained of meaning. This is why Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the United States, wrote in his welcoming remarks of “a reshuffling of core pieces of the international order” and a “leadership vacuum.” Who carries aloft the flag of liberalism and its values with anything resembling the autocratic convictions of the new strongmen — Vladimir Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in China, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, and Donald Trump in the United States? It’s no longer worth pretending that Trump is not in the authoritarian camp. The shock has passed. Europeans have internalized the shift. The best they can offer as liberty’s beacon in America’s stead is Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Merkel. He is being yellow-vested, and she is in her twilight years. If there is a particular foreboding hanging over this conference, it lies in the fact that the sonderweg, or (loosely) wayward path, of Trump’s America has occurred just as Europe splinters. Brexit is weeks away. Spain has just called yet another election. In France and Germany and Spain, the major political parties are losing power or disintegrating, challenged by nationalist xenophobes, leaving a fragmented political topography. Instability is inevitable. Trump favors such fragmentation because he believes it will leave weaker European powers more susceptible to his winner-takes-all bullying. Europeans have no illusions about this. The old order has frayed to the point of dissolution. It was based on the conviction that words have meaning. For Trump, they do not, as his declaration of a “national emergency” on the southern border with Mexico underscores. Without meaning, no law, no treaty, is worth the paper it’s written on. This is the real danger confronting the West. During the Warsaw theater, Roxana Saberi of CBS News confronted Pompeo on the hypocrisy of the United States denouncing human rights abuses in Iran while embracing Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, who, in the assessment of the C.I.A., ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist. Pompeo lost it, twice calling Saberi’s legitimate inquiry “a ridiculous question.” European powers see such braggadocio for what it is. They are contemplating the world without its postwar American anchor. Cometh the emergency-declaring strongman. He’s pitched camp in Washington, no less.

Please read the rules before joining the discussion. For a president to survive in Washington, it helps to have two things: a sense of humor and a dog. Donald Trump is the first Oval Office occupant in decades to have neither. Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law and an animal rescue advocate, has been pressing him to get a rescue dog, ABC News reported. But at a rally Monday in El Paso, Trump made clear there’s probably no puppy in his future. “I don’t have any time,” he told the audience, adding it “feels a little phony, phony to me.” In fact, a dog’s genuine love, along with a sense of humor, can go a long way toward smoothing over lapses, extinguishing fires and softening unappetizing traits. But the only use Trump seems to have for dogs is as epithets. His critics have been “fired like a dog” and “dumped like a dog.” They choked, cheated, lied, sweated or begged like dogs. Women's March in London on Jan. 19, 2019. (Photo11: Will Oliver/epa-EFE) Read more commentary: During a tragedy a dog may be the only one to bring comfort Repay dogs for their military service. Stop the deadly VA canine experiments. Reader suggestion: Why Donald Trump should get a dog As for a sense of humor, even with a script, a stage and the perfect occasion, Trump can still blow it. He had a shot last March at Washington’s Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering that brings together journalists and politicians for a mutual roasting. He got off to a strong start. “My staff was concerned heading into this dinner that I couldn’t do self-deprecating humor…. And I told them not to worry. Nobody does self-deprecating humor better than I do.” It was a good line, and the audience was with him. But after several laugh-worthy moments, Trump descended into a long and unfunny stream of consciousness. As for next month’s Gridiron dinner, it’s unclear whether he will attend. A few presidents — John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, in particular — had keen senses of humor that they used to great advantage. (“Please tell me you’re Republicans,” Reagan famously quipped to surgeons after he was shot in a 1981 assassination attempt.) The last president to have no sense of humor was Richard Nixon. We all know how that story ended. But at least Nixon had dogs. He was often photographed on the beach in San Clemente, the Western White House, with his gorgeous Irish setter King Timahoe. In 1952, his daughters’ cocker spaniel saved his threatened vice-presidential nomination after accusations he took campaign contributions for personal use. Appearing on television to refute the charges, Nixon vowed to keep one personal gift from an admiring voter: a black and white puppy the family named Checkers. ''The kids, like all kids, love the dog, and I just want to say… that regardless of what they say about it, we're going to keep it.” Corny and sentimental, sure. But Nixon emerged from what became known as the Checkers speech with a cleaner reputation. Many other presidents had “celebrity” dogs, too. Warren Harding’s Airedale terrier Laddie Boy had a special chair to sit in during Cabinet meetings. George H.W. and Barbara Bush’s English springer spaniel, Millie, “dictated” a children’s book about her adventures as First Canine. And who could forget Bush’s yellow Labrador service dog, Sully, lying faithfully by the side of his owner’s casket in the Capitol? One of the most famous presidential dogs was Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Scottish terrier, Fala, an inseparable soulmate to FDR, who took him on diplomatic trips. During the 1944 election campaign for Roosevelt’s historic fourth term, Republicans accused him of accidentally leaving Fala behind on a trip and sending a Navy destroyer to pick him up at taxpayers’ expense. At a Teamsters Union speech, Roosevelt replied: “These Republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me, or my wife, or on my sons. No, … they now include my little dog, Fala. Well, of course, I don’t resent attacks … but Fala does resent them.” The Teamsters ate it up, as did a nationwide radio audience — making it a turning point in the campaign. It’s pretty late in the game, but maybe Trump can still discover that a public sense-of-humor would do more for his approval rating than nasty tweets. As for getting a dog, Trump is right, it wouldn’t work if it was just a prop. “How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?” he wondered aloud at Monday’s rally. Actually, he might just look more … human. Saundra Torry is a former USA TODAY editorial writer.

---split---10.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/waiting-for-sam-ervin---split---Folksy North Carolina Sen. Sam Ervin, center, chaired the committee that destroyed Nixon’s strongest claim to power — his political popularity, Shapiro writes. (CQ Roll Call file photo) OPINION — It is easy to imagine an undiscovered Samuel Beckett play entitled “Waiting for Mueller.” On stage, faithful Democrats vacillate between stubborn hope (“He should be here”) and fatalistic despair (“He didn’t say for sure that he would come”). In the end, they just wait, day after day. Whatever Robert Mueller’s internal timetable (seers like Rudy Giuliani have so far been comically wrong in trying to predict it), the investigation will face new pressures with the virtually certain Senate confirmation this week of William Barr. For the first time, Mueller will be supervised by a legitimate attorney general — rather than an acting Donald Trump factotum — who has avoided any promises about releasing the full report. All of this might be ominous for Mueller were it not for existence of Democratic House committee chairmen armed with subpoena power. Jerry Nadler, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, just pointedly announced the appointment of two high-profile Trump critics (Norman Eisen and Barry Berke) as legal consultants. At moments like this, it is tempting to dust off Watergate parallels from the Saturday Night Massacre (Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox) to the House Judiciary impeachment vote that helped precipitate Nixon’s resignation. But there are major differences between Trump’s current troubles and Nixon’s resignation beyond the existence of a presidential Twitter account and capital-letter tweets wailing and railing about a “WITCH HUNT.” Trump’s behavior, from his fan-boy embrace of Vladimir Putin to his cynical profiteering from his hotel empire in the White House, has never been subject to sustained congressional scrutiny. Fired FBI Director James Comey’s June 2017 appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee remains the most dramatic congressional hearing about Trump’s conduct in the Oval Office. In dramatic contrast, the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, chaired by folksy North Carolina Democrat Sam Ervin, paved the way for Nixon’s downfall. For 51 days from May until November 1973, Americans of all political persuasions were riveted by the Ervin hearings that were broadcast gavel-to-gavel and repeated in the evenings on PBS. According to the Gallup Poll, more than 70 percent of Americans watched at least part of the hearings. Watch: How does impeachment work? The hearings had everything, including the stunning revelation by Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield that the president had a taping system for recording conversations in the Oval Office. The parade of witnesses included comic characters like tough-talking retired New York City detective Tony Ulasewicz, who recounted his adventures as a Nixon bagman delivering cash payoffs to the plotters behind the Watergate break-in. But the hearings were mostly defined by gravely serious witnesses like former White House counsel John Dean, who testified about telling Nixon, “There was a cancer growing on the presidency and that if the cancer was not removed, then the president himself would be killed by it.” (I should mention that the idea for this column was triggered by a recent conversation with Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Martin Luther King biographer. More relevant, Branch was the ghostwriter for Dean’s bestselling Watergate confessional, “Blind Ambition.”) The Ervin committee hearings destroyed Nixon’s strongest claim to power — his political popularity. At the beginning of 1973, fresh off his 49-state sweep against George McGovern, Nixon boasted a lofty approval rating of 68 percent. By August 1973, Nixon had lost more than half his supporters, with the Gallup Poll clocking him in at a dismal 31 percent. Although Nixon survived in the White House for another year, his approval rating never again came close to 40 percent. Despite a mostly buoyant economy, Trump’s own approval rating has been bouncing along for months just over 40 percent. But for all the attention devoted to the Mueller investigation in Washington, there remains a level of abstraction surrounding it. It’s like a battle scene in Shakespeare when everything is occurring offstage — and the audience just gets periodic bulletins from messengers and wounded soldiers. While nothing is certain, the odds seem high that Trump’s popularity would take a major hit if Americans got to view protracted public testimony from the likes of Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and, yes, Jared Kushner. Whether the topic were plans for the Trump Tower in Moscow or campaign payoffs to the president’s purported paramours, it would be hard for honest Republicans to dismiss such a tawdry parade of Trump associates as “fake news.” But a dramatic set of congressional hearings needs more than just a compelling roster of witnesses. Part of the secret of the success of the Ervin committee was that, as a select Senate body, it was limited to just seven hand-picked members. As a result, senators could pursue their inquiries without being tongue-tied by arbitrary time limits. Nadler’s Judiciary Committee, in contrast, has (gulp) 41 members. Unless committee Democrats are willing to subordinate their political egos for a larger cause, there would be no way to follow a consistent line of inquiry in the face of expected GOP obstruction. Maybe the solution would be for Nancy Pelosi to appoint a small select committee on the Watergate model. Or maybe the bulk of the questioning before the Judiciary and similar committees should be handled by senior staffers and outside attorneys rather than individual legislators preening during their five minutes on camera. All predictions about Trump’s future have to be balanced against the reality that House Democrats are planning what they hope will be the most explosive set of congressional hearings in nearly half a century. These hearings may prove as politically important as the Mueller report itself. Which is why there may be still another Beckett play called “Waiting for Nadler.” Walter Shapiro has covered the last 10 presidential campaigns.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/trump-national-emergency-data-doesnt-exist/---split---Toward the end of a White House press conference Friday morning, during which President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in order to secure up to $8 billion in funding for a border wall, White House reporter Brian Karem stood to ask the president a single question: “What do you base your facts on?” It was the most clarifying question in an hour-long display that at times felt as hard to grasp as a slinky. During his remarks, President Trump repeatedly called into question and even dismissed as lies much of the available data that exists on immigration and crime, all while glorifying countries like China that give drug dealers the death penalty and painting a picture of a country under siege by criminal invaders. So, Karem asked, what is that picture based on? President Trump responded in generalities. “I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. The numbers I have from Homeland Security are a disaster,” he said. Asked to clarify what numbers he’s referring to, Trump said, “I use many stats.” https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1096478979178008576 One possible reason President Trump may have had trouble producing those stats? They don’t really exist. Again and again throughout his remarks, and throughout his years-long battle to build a wall on the southern border, President Trump has relied, instead, on anecdotes, highlighting, for example, the heartbreaking stories of mothers whose children have been killed by undocumented immigrants or noting, as he did during the press conference, individual examples of people being killed on the border last week. These stories confirm President Trump’s stated belief that something new and dangerous is taking place on the border, and so he holds up them up as all the proof the American public needs that he's right. But as the saying goes, the plural of anecdote is not data. The government's own data, instead, suggest just the opposite of what the president needs the country to believe in order to fulfill his chief campaign promise and build a border wall. “His speech basically repeated every falsehood, every misconception, and every untruth that has been stated about the border and illegal immigrant crime and national security threats involving immigration for the last several years,” says Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at libertarian think tank Cato Institute. Take the president’s suggestion on Friday that a disproportionately high number of undocumented people make up the federal prison population. According to a Department of Justice report released last June, about 20 percent of the federal prison population in the first quarter of 2018 were “known or suspected aliens,” and 93 percent of them were in the country illegally. The Federal Bureau of Prisons told WIRED on Friday that "19.3 percent of the BOP's inmates have either unknown or non-US citizenship," which, of course, includes a far broader category of immigrants than only the undocumented ones. But the demographics of the federal prison population are hardly a fair proxy for the country as a whole. As the DOJ’s report states, 90 percent of the incarcerated population in the US resides in state and local prisons, and the rate of undocumented people in state and local prisons is far harder to calculate, as few states report those statistics. In Texas, one state that does calculate these figures, a Cato report found that in 2015, "as a percentage of their respective populations, there were 50 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans." In addition, immigration offenses are themselves federal offenses. It stands to reason, then, that people serving time for immigration offenses would be overrepresented in the prisons where people serve time for immigration offenses. The DOJ report doesn’t state what percentage of undocumented immigrants are in federal prison for violence or drug charges. Neither did President Trump. Then there’s the president’s insistence that Democrats are lying when they say ports of entry, and not the southern border, are most responsible for drug smuggling. But in November of 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration reported exactly that. “The most common method employed by these [transnational criminal organizations] involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. [ports of entry] in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers,” the report reads. The president's bleak description of rampant violence along the border also stands in stark contrast to what the Federal Bureau of Investigation's statistics show, Nowrasteh says. According to FBI crime reports obtained by Cato, in 2017, the violent crime rate, property crime rate, and homicide rate were lower along border counties than they were in the United States writ large. Not only that, but according to Customs and Border Patrol, in 2018 gang members accounted for just .2 percent of all apprehensions at the border. "Those numbers would be very different if there was a real invasion," Nowrasteh says. Such willful distorting of data in the service of stoking fear about a group of people has scary historical precedents, says Jason Stanley, a philosophy professor at Yale University and author of the book How Fascism Works. "He's saying data doesn't matter. He’s saying, 'This is about my power,'" Stanley says. "It’s a sign of power that you can declare a national emergency without there being one." Before President Trump even completed his address, he anticipated the ways in which that power may be checked. "We will have a national emergency, and we’ll then be sued," he said, expressing full confidence that the Supreme Court would eventually uphold his declaration. Hours later, the American Civil Liberties Union announced its plans to file a lawsuit early next week, arguing that the president's actions are "unprecedented." “By the president’s very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency. He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress, and decided to move along his promise for a border wall ‘faster,'" the ACLU's staff attorney, Dror Ladin, wrote in a statement. "This is a patently illegal power grab that hurts American communities and flouts the checks and balances that are hallmarks of our democracy." The data may not matter to the White House. Now we'll see if it matters to the courts. Immigrants founded half of the billion dollar startups in the US. Now many worry that Trump's current travel ban and any future restrictions to work visas could hamper growth in Silicon Valley. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-emergency-declaration-build-wall-will-cost-americans-more-ncna972146---split---There is a national emergency, but it’s not coming from caravans massing in Mexico. It’s from an authoritarian flailing in Washington. The crisis that the country is now confronting has less to do with a porous physical boundary than with how the limits of presidential power are eroding before our eyes. President Donald Trump has ended weeks of flirting with the use of emergency powers to build his border wall and is taking the plunge. But one can only ruminate on an “emergency” for months before a solution is proffered that will take a decade to implement when the emergency is flimflam – a tissue of an excuse to assume ordinarily unavailable powers. The situation on the border is hardly an emergency. Unauthorized border crossings are lower than they’ve been in almost a half-century: Barely 300,000 people were detained trying to cross in fiscal year 2017, when the border was more secure than ever, as compared with 1.6 million in FY2000. The percentage of undocumented immigrants in border states is falling. And the counties abutting the Mexican border are among the nation’s safest. There are humanitarian challenges at the border, but Trump and his inhumane policies are largely their cause rather than solution. Tellingly Trump seems to have culled his most colorful warnings of border-related dangers from the silver screen and even admitted that his proclamation is a farce: “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said in his bizarre Friday press conference. But if something isn’t even necessary, it’s definitely not an emergency. The crisis to which Trump is actually responding relates to his own impotence: The self-styled master negotiator couldn’t persuade even quiescent Republicans to fund a wall during their congressional supremacy and then he couldn’t leverage his government shutdown to force one from a Democratic majority. So he’s decided to cut Congress out of the policy-making process. Doing so will unleash legal and political firestorms. Congress will vote on a resolution to end the “emergency,” forcing Trump to veto it if passed. And it will trigger lawsuits not only from legislators upset that he’s seizing their constitutional prerogatives, but from border-area landowners unwilling to sacrifice their property on the altar of King Donald’s whims now freed, as a result of the president’ emergency order, from the restrictions of the Depression-era Declaration of Takings Act which would otherwise limit their ability to sue to stop the project. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had warned against such a declaration before essentially agreeing to it; Republicans are already worried about the precedent a non-emergency emergency declaration sets. “I don’t believe that’s the way we should be doing these sorts of things,” said Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who had previously mused that a future Democratic president might use such a declaration about climate change to seize fossil-fuel power plants. (Indeed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday noted that the next Democratic president might declare gun violence a national emergency.) But forget a future Democrat’s intentions: If Trump, long on despotic instincts and short on patience, gets away with this declaration, why wouldn’t he do it again? It’s staggering to imagine what other dead-end fancies might he resurrect as emergencies. On the precedent question, though, it will be instructive to see how quickly the 2020 Democratic hopefuls’ condemnations of Trump’s overreach will be replaced with vows to exercise emergency powers to deal with issues such as climate change, gun violence or health care in the absence of Congressional action. But even if that doesn’t happen this election cycle, if Trump’s power-grab isn’t slapped down — hard — it’s inevitable that unfettered emergency declaration powers will become stump speech and debate staples before becoming staples of presidential legislating. Accomplishing something in the face of partisan sclerosis does have a certain appeal in 2019. But, as Julius Caesar is credited with saying, “All bad precedents begin as justifiable measures.” (Caesar, remember, had first-hand experience with a necrotic republic.) Our system was designed around checks, balances and the need for compromise. Power was divided among three co-equal branches of government, each able to check the power of the others. Congress makes laws — including ones dictating how the federal government raises and spends money — and the president executes them faithfully. This is basic high school civics stuff, which might explain why it seems mysterious to Trump. His national emergency scheme threatens to upend that balance. If emergency declarations become a way for an executive to legislate, then a president unable or unwilling to reach a deal with Congress need not make the effort to engage with the constitutional requirements set forth by our Founding Fathers. And to the extent that members of Congress go along with this — and several seem poised to join Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in the quisling caucus — they are deliberately downgrading their branch from coequal to subordinate, and slouching toward irrelevant. This is just the latest and arguably most dangerous instance of a trend that predates Trump but which, like everything else he touches, he’s made worse. Over recent decades the unwritten rules of politics, norms which distinguished powers that could be exercised from ones that should be, have increasingly been disregarded. So the filibuster, once rarely used, is now the Senate standard. Acts of political terrorism – threatening deliberate harm to Americans through a government shutdown or national debt default unless otherwise unachievable demands are met – have become commonplace. Prosecutorial discretion was a matter of efficiency before President Barack Obama made it a policy tool. The Senate accepted a president’s power to fill Supreme Court vacancies during his term until, without precedent, it didn’t. McConnell’s threat to politicize the response to 2016 Russian hacking scuttled the idea of politics stopping at the shoreline. And national emergencies were heretofore used to enact noncontroversial responses to real crises rather than as a tool of expediency for politically untenable ends. In each case, politicians maximized partisan gains with little regard for long-term consequences. It’s a political tragedy of the commons, where the desire to score points subsumes the greater good of having a functional and responsive political system. All of those examples illustrate a broader, darker picture of a political culture finding short-cuts away from the sometimes-arduous process of consensus, compromise and cooperation and instead opting for the quicker and easier — but constitutionally destructive — path of authoritarianism facilitated by obstruction. When running for office, Donald Trump promised repeatedly that Mexico was going to pay for his wall. Instead, it turns out, that we all may pay for it – both with our taxes and with our polity.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/emergency-border-wall.html---split---Supported by By Michael Tackett WASHINGTON — President Trump has decided to roll out the big cannon. In the Rose Garden on Friday, he said he was declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico, using money from other federal accounts, after Congress declined to authorize sufficient funds to satisfy him in legislation that averts another government shutdown. Mr. Trump is wielding extraordinary power to get his way. Democrats strenuously dispute that there is a national security crisis on the border that warrants using the kind of presidential authority that in the past has been used for grave matters like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump’s action. Republicans in Congress, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, were fine with the spending deal that they reached with Democrats to keep the government open. But more hard-line elements within the party scalded Mr. Trump with criticism, including the Fox host Laura Ingraham and the conservative commentator Ann Coulter. But as The New York Times reported early Friday, the president felt cornered into accepting the deal and agreed to it only with Mr. McConnell’s promise to support an emergency declaration. Still, the White House assuaged some other skeptics of the funding deal, namely Sean Hannity on Fox and the radio host Rush Limbaugh, both of whom in effect announced the president’s decision in advance and encouraged their followers to fall in line. Mr. Trump is willing to risk the blowback, even from members of his party, and a possible court defeat, if it means he can tell his core supporters that he did all he could to build the wall. Democrats cannot stop the president from issuing the declaration, but they can make it very uncomfortable for Republicans. They can vote to terminate the president’s declaration on the grounds that there is no emergency — there is strong sentiment among Democrats to do that — which would force Republicans in the Senate to make a tough vote over Mr. Trump’s extraordinary exercise of power. Already, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has been sharply critical of the president using his authority this way, and fellow Republican Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky also have been highly skeptical. Mr. Paul called it “extraconstitutional.” So the president’s action will force Republicans to decide whether to back him — and then set a precedent for a future Democratic president to use power this way — or embarrass Mr. Trump with a vote that could undo his declaration. The president could veto the resolution, and the declaration would likely remain in place because there would not be sufficient votes to override it, but his standing would be undermined. Mr. Trump has to find money from other federal programs to make up a $4 billion shortfall from his initial demand for border wall funding. He can do this by taking money from funding for projects. The declaration enables Mr. Trump to divert $3.6 billion budgeted for military construction projects, and he will also tap into $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. All told, that leaves him with about $8 billion for the wall, including the $1.375 billion authorized by Congress in the spending package that averts a government shutdown. Each of those pots of money comes with a specific constituency that authorized it in the first place, and those constituencies may not be pleased to see it used for another purpose. With this declaration, a court challenge is a near certainty. A party opposing the president will probably seek an injunction — a halt in the action — while the matter is litigated. Yet every day that the wall is not built could undermine Mr. Trump’s fundamental premise that there is an emergency at the border. The challenges are likely to be many, in jurisdictions from coast to coast, increasing the chances that new construction would not start any time soon. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has been among the few Democrats who seem to be able to stare down the president. In this case, she has offered a not-so-subtle warning about what she sees as an abuse of the emergency authority. She pointed to the mass shootings in the United States, and noted that perhaps the president should issue a national emergency about guns. That could be a mere preview of how she and the Democrats will frame the case against the president, starting with the idea that he has abused is constitutional authority. After his speech on Friday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, vowed to try to overturn the decision. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” they said in a joint statement. Expect to hear a lot from Ms. Pelosi about a basic tenet of American government, that Congress is a coequal branch of government that is not cowed by presidential whim. Democratic presidential candidates already believe they have a list of reasons to deny Mr. Trump a second term. In turn, he has increasingly tried to cast them as far-left socialists. The national emergency declaration may give Democrats an opening to turn his case upside-down, allowing them to argue that he has governed as an authoritarian who put his desires for a pet project above democracy.

But declaring a national emergency isn’t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs WASHINGTON – Pressed to explain his decision to declare a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border to help build his controversial wall, President Donald Trump said Friday he relies on "many stats" from "a lot of sources" to inform his opinions. Trump did not specify which statistics guided his decision. Critics have noted that border crossings are down significantly from a decade ago and that most illegal drugs coming through the border arrive through ports of entry. How both sides frame the situation at the border will play a central role in the legal battles that will follow Trump's national emergency declaration. Democrats have accused Trump of manufacturing the crisis to build political support for the wall. Apprehensions along the southern border are actually at historic lows. Border Patrol routinely apprehended more than 1 million people a year – peaking at 1.6 million in 2000 – throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In 2017, it apprehended just over 300,000. It 2018, it apprehended just under 400,000. “I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily," Trump said during one of the more heated exchanges of a press conference Friday in the White House Rose Garden. "The numbers that come out of Homeland Security for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration." Trump gets sing-songy, hopes for fair shake in wall lawsuit (Photo11: WHITE HOUSE) But it’s not clear whether DHS has ever produced such an analysis, which focuses on immigration enforcement and processing visas for people entering the country. The department did not immediately return a question about economic reports. Trump has spent much of his presidency describing the situation on the border as a "national crisis" and calling caravans of migrants arriving from Central America an "invasion." Last year he deployed thousands of active and National Guard soldiers to the border to place razor wire along sections of wall that already exist. Many of the migrants arriving in the caravans are applying for asylum, a legal form of immigration. Some have sought to slip across the border illegally. Data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show the vast majority of drugs seized along the southern border are caught by Customs officers at ports of entry, not by Border Patrol agents who monitor the vast stretches between those ports. According to CBP statistics, 90 percent of heroin seized along the border, 88 percent of cocaine, 87 percent of methamphetamine, and 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 11 months of the 2018 fiscal year was caught trying to be smuggled in at legal crossing points. A reporter pressed Trump on whether the statistics published by his own agencies are wrong. "No. No. I use many stats," Trump said. "You have stats that are far worse than the ones I use but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security." A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

But declaring a national emergency isn’t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to pay for his long-promised and controversial border wall. The national emergency and other measures will free up $8 billion – far more than the $5.7 billion he initially demanded – to free up funding for 234 miles of bollard wall, the White House said. It's a move that is almost guaranteed to draw the White House into a lengthy legal battle over the president's ability to use the tool for that purpose. So where will the White House find that money? More: Candidate Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. What happened? Military construction Trump will attempt to access $3.6 billion in military construction money. Unlike other portions of the plan, the president must declare a national emergency to access this account, which has long been rumored to be under consideration. The money is used for military bases and other projects. President George W. Bush tapped into this same account after he declared a national emergency following the 2001 terrorist attacks. White House officials said they did not yet know which military constructions might be cancelled or delayed by the move. President Donald Trump gestures while delivering remarks at the Major County Sheriffs and Major Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference, in Washington on Feb. 13, 2019. (Photo11: Michael Reynolds, epa-efe) Trump will dip into about $600 million in asset forfeiture funds at Department of Treasury. This funding has been controversial on both sides of the aisle because it comes from government seizures of property. More: National emergencies are common; declaring one for a border wall is not More: Trump's emergency declaration would trigger a drawn-out legal fight More: How congressional Democrats could fight a Trump national emergency Current law gives the president power to rely on the Department of Defense for drug interdiction in certain cases, even without a national emergency. The law says the Pentagon can assist in that effort through the building of fences and other measures. The White House believes it can draw about $2.5 billion through this provision. White House officials did not say, specifically, where that money will come from. Part of Trump's package includes the $1.375 billion that Congress approved on a bipartisan basis for border barriers late Thursday night. That measure, which will also avert another government shutdown, limits Trump to spending the money only on previously approved barrier designs, including the "bollard wall" design that was also used by the Obama administration.

---split---11.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/house-may-vote-on-resolution-to-disapprove-of-national-emergency---split---Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., said the House will vote on a resolution to disapprove of President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency to build the wall. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Updated 9:34 p.m. | The House will vote on a resolution of disapproval that would push back on President Donald Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency to free up more funds for a wall along the southern border, according to New York Democrat Nydia M. Velázquez. But a leadership aide said no such decision about a vote has been made. Velázquez said the timing of the vote had not yet been settled on but added that the disapproval resolution sponsored by Texas Democrat Joaquin Castro would be the first vote taken. Castro, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement that he was “prepared to introduce a resolution to terminate the President’s emergency declaration under 50 U.S.C. 1622. (National Emergencies Act)” if Trump made such a move. Velázquez also noted that there are discussions about moving other bills such as one she introduced to prevent money Congress appropriated for disaster relief from being used for the wall. The aide said it would be impossible for leaders to decide a path forward until they see what Trump does. Trump hasn’t yet declared a national emergency but is expected to do so Friday as he signs the fiscal 2019 appropriations package Congress is preparing to send him Thursday night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday that Democrats will weigh their options for a response, including taking legal action. She was asked about the possibility of scheduling a vote that would put Republicans on record over Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency but declined to confirm if she would do that. “I don’t believe that there’s any good faith negotiations to have with the Republicans in Congress if they’re going to support the president doing an end-run about what the will of the people, the Congress of the United States, has put forth,” the California Democrat said. “So we will review our options and I’m not prepared to give any preference to any one of them right now.” Velázquez, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico, is concerned that Trump may use the national emergency declaration to take money from the relief effort to help the U.S. territory with its recovery from the 2017 hurricanes that ravaged the island. “There is not a national emergency at our border,” she said Thursday, appealing directly to Trump. “A national emergency is when 3.4 million American citizens endure the longest blackout on American history after a hurricane. … A national emergency is what your administration caused in Puerto Rico.” Velázquez spoke alongside a handful of Democrats from California and New York in opposition to the national emergency. Rep. John Garamendi mentioned several Army Corps of Engineer projects in California that Trump may target. He also has a bill that would prevent Trump from raiding disaster relief funds. In addition to legislative action, the members said that they expected a coordinated legal response from Democrats inside and outside Congress and that the state of California was likely to be involved. “There appears to be plenty of opportunities for lawsuits here,” Garamendi said, noting there’s been discussion of that at the leadership level. Pelosi said she “may” mount a legal challenge against the declaration but did not not want to commit to anything until seeing Trump’s explanation for his action.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47258754---split---Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window President Trump has confirmed he will use emergency powers to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, saying "walls work". Building the wall was a key pledge of Mr Trump's campaign, but Democrats have described the move as a "gross abuse of power". He later signed the plan along with a spending bill aimed at preventing a repeat of a recent government shutdown. He announced the plan after Congress refused to pay for a wall in the bill. Senior Democrats immediately said that they would challenge the move in the courts. The declaration will give Mr Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. Making the announcement in the White House Rose Garden, the president said the emergency would allow him to get almost $8bn for the wall. The money is expected to be diverted from military construction projects and efforts to fight the drugs trade. This is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the wall along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border. "We're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border," Mr Trump said. "We have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable. "Everyone knows that walls work." But Mr Trump accepted that he would be sued for the move, and predicted that the emergency order would lead to legal action which was likely to end up in the Supreme Court. By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor The trouble with going nuclear is there is fall-out. This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue. On one side of the wall, Republicans; on the other side Democrats. But by going nuclear the president has made it more complicated than that. There are a lot of Republicans - in the Senate and in the House - deeply uneasy about what Mr Trump is doing. Why? Because the constitutional arrangement of the US is that Congress - not the president - controls the purse strings and allocates funds. This is a major land grab by the president. It undermines their position and sets a very dangerous precedent. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer responded to Mr Trump's announcement with a statement saying they would challenge the move in Congress and in the courts "using every remedy available". "The president's unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defence funds for the security of our military and our nation," the statement said. "This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process." Ms Pelosi also seized on a remark by Mr Trump in response to a question from a reporter, in which he said he "didn't need to do this" but had done so because he wanted a quicker result than by going through Congress. Analysts suggest that this remark could undermine Mr Trump's case in court that the country was facing an emergency. It didn’t take Nancy Pelosi long to pick up on that line. I imagine we’ll see it in a court brief soon. https://t.co/SUjVL7BNFP End of Twitter post by @awzurcher Within minutes of the announcement, New York State attorney-general Letitia James vowed to mount a legal challenge. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it - and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential contender and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Maine Susan Collins, who said the move was of "dubious constitutionality". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. The National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Mr Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts. The largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. Declaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. "It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past," said the Republican senator Ron Johnson. The US president confirms he will use emergency powers to build a wall on Mexico's border. 15 sayings from around the world
---split---12.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-change-resolution-national-emergency_n_5c670757e4b01757c36b6b0a---split---Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) swung back at President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on Friday over a border wall by announcing plans to introduce a similar resolution for a crisis that scientists around the world warn we are running out of time to address ― climate change. “If Trump can call a national emergency for a fake crisis at the border, then surely Congress should call a national emergency for a REAL crisis,” Blumenauer said in a statement. During a press conference on Friday, Trump admitted that the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border did not warrant such a declaration. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. In a related letter to congressional colleagues, Blumenauer called Trump’s decision “profoundly disturbing” and urged them to join him in co-sponsoring his emergency resolution on climate change. “What our country should be doing right now is focusing on addressing a real national emergency and one of the most pressing issues of our time: the climate crisis,” Blumenauer wrote. “If Donald Trump wants to start declaring national emergencies for fake crises, Congress should address the real ones, starting with climate change.” With his controversial decision, Trump may have opened the door to a broader use of emergency declarations. “We should do something about the actual emergencies that plague our nation — like climate change or health care access — not playing politics in order to build a wasteful border wall,” Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), one of several Democratic presidential candidates, tweeted on Friday. We should do something about the actual emergencies that plague our nation — like climate change or health care access — not playing politics in order to build a wasteful border wall. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) called on America’s next president to take that kind of step. Our next President should declare a #NationalEmergency on day 1 to address the existential threat to all life on the planet posed by Climate Change. And Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) warned that Trump’s use of emergency powers could lead to a Democratic president declaring an emergency to combat gun violence and then instituting universal background checks and banning assault weapons. 100 people die from guns every day. That’s a national emergency. If Trump gets away w this border emergency declaration, then a Dem President can declare a gun violence emergency and institute universal background checks and an assault weapons ban by executive action. So... In a January post on the Legal Planet blog, Dan Farber, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, explored a number of ways that future presidents could use emergency powers to fight climate change. Doing so, Farber wrote, “would be far more legitimate than Trump’s wall effort,” given the scientific community’s warnings and the fact that the Pentagon has recognized that climate change is a national security threat. Late last year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S. issued separate reports concluding that averting climate catastrophe would require immediate, sweeping cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the Trump administration has downplayed the threat. “I don’t believe it,” Trump said of his own administration’s report, adding that “we’re the cleanest we’ve ever been.” Blumenauer is one of dozens of co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, a nonbinding climate resolution introduced last week by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). The measure outlines the lofty goals of slashing global greenhouse gas emissions 40 to 60 percent by 2030, building climate-resilient infrastructure, and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs. Republicans were quick to dismiss it as an “impossible” and “pie-in-the-sky” proposal, and Trump said it “sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark.” “The climate crisis is impacting our world as we know it,” Blumenauer said Friday. “Every day, our temperatures are rising and our sea levels are following suit, threatening more intense storms and natural disasters. Saving the planet is our most pressing issue that must be addressed with urgent action, not a manufactured ‘crisis’ at the border.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---12.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-declare-national-emergency-obtain-billions-border-wall-n972021---split---WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in an effort to circumvent Congress and fund the wall he promised to build along the U.S. border with Mexico. "We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers with all types of criminals and gangs," Trump said in remarks delivered in the White House Rose Garden just before he issued the order. But he seemed to undercut the theme of urgency when he took questions later, telling NBC's Peter Alexander that the move wasn't really necessary. "I could do the wall over a longer period of time," he said. "I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster." The controversial executive action — which Trump acknowledged would draw lawsuits — came the day after Congress cleared a bill for his signature that prevents a second government shutdown in two months and provides just under $1.4 billion for 55 miles of new fencing along the border. Trump has indicated he will sign the bill, which passed with veto-proof majorities in both chambers, despite pressure from some conservatives to veto it because of its limitations on the type and length of barrier that can be built. "The current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics," Trump said in the proclamation, released later in the afternoon, when he also signed the appropriations measures. "Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis." Trump addressed the voices of dissent on his right flank in his Friday morning remarks, saying that conservative commentator and sometime critic of his approach Ann Coulter is "off the reservation." He also said that allies like Fox's Sean Hannity and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh have his ear but "they don't decide policy." The emergency declaration could allow him to spend money on barriers from a variety of accounts, including the $1.4 billion in the appropriations bill, if his actions clear legal hurdles. Democratic leaders in Congress quickly vowed to fight Trump on what they said was an overstep of his authority. "The president's actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution," Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement. "The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available." Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told NBC Thursday night that he planned to introduce a joint resolution terminating the national emergency, but that would not take effect unless both chambers of Congress passed it and either the president signed it or Congress overrode a veto. Trump, who spoke without the aid of a teleprompter, appeared to have difficulty staying focused on the task at hand during lengthy remarks that veered from trade relations with China and his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the state of the economy. He did not provide all of the details of his border plan. But senior administration officials said Friday that with the declaration, Trump will have access to a total of $8 billion for the wall. That figure includes $1.375 billion offered by Congress in the spending bill for fencing in Texas; $600 million from the Treasury Department’s drug forfeiture fund; $2.5 billion from a Defense Department drug interdiction program; and $3.5 billion from a military construction budget under an emergency declaration by the president. He got swift support from traditional allies, including Jenny Beth Martin, honorary chair of the Tea Party Patriots Action group. "We applaud President Trump for working to keep his promise to the American people and fighting to make our country safe and secure," Martin said in a statement. Trump has said for weeks that he was considering using his national emergency powers to unlock funds for his wall, despite originally vowing that Mexico would pay for it. News of Trump's plan to declare a national emergency was met with swift criticism from lawmakers in both parties Thursday, with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, calling it a "dangerous step." Several Republicans have warned that a Democratic president could follow suit and use a national emergency declaration to fund liberal priorities in the future, and many lawmakers in both parties regard the prospect of a president shifting billions of dollars of funding into a new project as a worrisome precedent even if the courts uphold the plan. John Paul Woodley Jr., a former assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said in an interview before the announcement that he's not aware of any prior effort by an administration to transfer money on such a large scale. In the past, said Woodley, who oversaw the Army Corps of Engineers, relatively small sums — "in the millions, not in the billions" — have been moved to address natural disasters. "Congress regards — particularly the appropriations committees regard — any reprogramming, however small, as a very serious matter," he said.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/fact-checking-trump-emergency-border.html---split---Supported by Fact Check To justify redirecting federal funds to a wall, the president made a litany of assertions about crime, drugs and other issues on the southern border. Nearly all were misleading, exaggerated or false. By Linda Qiu As President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall, he again painted a portrait of a lawless, chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts. Illegal border crossings have been declining for decades. While families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men, a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum, which is legal. Research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border, as official ports of entry are the main route into the United States for both. Cumulatively, Mr. Trump’s unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency, a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges. What Was Said “In El Paso they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It’s a lot of murders. But it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall in Mexico.” Mr. Trump is correct that there were 23 murders in El Paso last year, compared with more than 1,200 murders in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. But the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns. In 2007, the year before border fencing construction began, El Paso reported 17 murders while Juárez recorded about 320 homicides, before the drug war between cartels escalated. In 2010, after the barriers were largely completed, El Paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later. That same year, murders in Juárez topped 3,600 before declining to over 2,000 in 2011. What Was Said “When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just a lie. It’s all a lie.” Mr. Trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points, or ports of entry. The relevant statistics come from Mr. Trump’s own agencies, not Democrats. Data from Customs and Border Protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry (marijuana is the exception). The Drug Enforcement Administration noted that a “small percentage of all heroin” is seized at areas between ports of entry. What Was Said “You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.” You can. For example, the Justice Department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from Thailand into the United States and coerce them into the sex trade. About 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry, according to a decade’s worth of data collected by the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative. The Polaris Project, a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the United States, said in a statement that out of nearly 50,000 cases it has handled, “the vast majority of victims” arrive through ports of entry. What Was Said “Take a look at Israel. They’re building another wall. Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.” Israel built a wall along its border with Egypt in 2013, and it has proved to be effective. Israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16,000 in 2011 — a 99 percent reduction. Whether that example could be applied to the United States is another matter, as PolitiFact has reported. The border between Israel and Egypt is much shorter than the United States-Mexico border, along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain. Israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border. What Was Said “And the people that say we create precedent, well, what do you have 56 or a lot of times that is creating precedent.” Mr. Trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978, 30 of which are still in effect. But those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad. Examples include blocking transactions with the Taliban, prohibiting the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone, placing restrictions on North Korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Mr. Trump’s declaration, however, is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of Congress. What Was Said “I went through Congress. I made a deal. I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get $1, not $1, he’s not going to get $1. Well, I got $1.4 billion, but I’m not happy with it.” The funding deal passed by Congress on Thursday authorized $1.375 billion for border fencing, which is less than the $1.6 billion that senators proposed last June and that Mr. Trump rejected. Asked about his reaction to the reduced funding, Mr. Trump misleadingly cited comments made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. At a news conference in January, while the government was still partially shut down, Ms. Pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give Mr. Trump $1 for his border wall. But Ms. Pelosi and Democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security, referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers. At that same January news conference, Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats promoted a bill that included $1.3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government. Other claims: Mr. Trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that The New York Times has previously fact-checked: He misleadingly claimed that he had already “done a lot of wall.” (The first extension of barriers built before Mr. Trump took office, 14 miles, is scheduled to begin this month — a tiny portion of the 1,000-mile wall he promised.) He falsely claimed that the money for the wall was coming from the revised North American Free Trade Agreement. (Any additional federal revenue from the trade deal, which is not guaranteed, would still be coming from American consumers, not Mexico.) He claimed, with no evidence, that the man charged in a Manhattan truck attack sponsored “22 or 23 or 35 of his family members” to immigrate to the United States. (This is not possible, as the man was a green-card holder who would not have been able to sponsor extended family.) He claimed, with no evidence, that other countries are “putting some very bad people” in the diversity visa lottery. (Individuals enter the lottery on their own, and must pass a screening process that bars criminals and the indigent.) Curious about the accuracy of a claim? Email factcheck@nytimes.com.

Rich Pedroncelli/AP hide caption California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (right) and Gov. Gavin Newsom said California will sue President Trump over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. California plans to sue the Trump administration over the president's emergency declaration to fund construction of a border wall. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined state Attorney General Xavier Becerra to decry Trump's plan at a news conference Friday. They also hinted that a multistate lawsuit against the administration was imminent. "Donald Trump, we'll see you in court," Newsom said. "President Trump got one thing right this morning about his declaration when he said, 'I didn't have to do this.' He's right. He didn't have to do this. In fact, he can't do this," said Becerra. He said the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the powers to control how federal dollars are spent, not the president. Trump's emergency declaration came after Congress passed a spending bill that included only $1.375 billion for border security, short of the $5.7 billion the president requested. During Trump's announcement Friday, he said the declaration was needed "because of an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs." Becerra has previously threatened litigation if Trump declared an emergency. "The idea of declaring a nonexistent state of emergency on the border ... to pay for the wall is not only immoral, it is illegal," he said last week, after delivering the Spanish-language Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address. During Friday morning's news conference, Becerra said he believes the president knows that there is no national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. "He knows he will lose in court, and he is hoping to use the U.S. Supreme Court as a tool in his game to fulfill a campaign promise," Becerra said, referring to the president's repeated promises to build a border wall. "The consequences of that are harm: harm to Californians, harm to all Americans," Becerra added. Newsom said that California wants to work with the Trump administration to address the "legitimate crisis with drugs" in this country. "I don't want to be a sparring partner with President Trump. We want to be a working partner," Newsom said. "But he makes it all but impossible when he plays these games, and manufactures a crisis, and creates the conditions where we have no other choice but to sue the administration." Also on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California released a statement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling the declaration "unlawful."

---split---13.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-asked-wall-he-s-forcing-constitutional-crisis-n971911---split---WASHINGTON — Congress knew President Donald Trump thought there was a border crisis when it voted to curb his wall Thursday. In the arcane language of House and Senate appropriators, endorsed by veto-proof majorities in both chambers, lawmakers said Trump could have no more than $1.375 billion to build 55 new miles of steel fencing. They specifically cited the risk to law enforcement in banning him from constructing solid walls. It was a resounding and explicit rejection of the idea that there is a national emergency requiring billions of dollars to build a border wall. And that judgment was rendered at a time when Trump has been making a very public case — in speeches, interviews and tweets — that there is a "humanitarian and security crisis" and after he shut down the government for 35 days to make his point. This is not a case in which an act of God or war struck when Congress was dormant; lawmakers reacted — just not in the way the president had hoped. Put simply, Congress heard Trump's plea for emergency funding and used its primary authority under the Constitution — the power of the purse — to say no. That's not an answer Trump likes to hear. So he's not taking it. Instead, he announced a national emergency Friday morning that would allow him to draw $8 billion from the just-passed bill and other existing federal accounts to build the wall anyway, according to an administration official. Lawsuits will ensue, and the courts will have to decide whether and how to intervene in a power struggle between the other two branches. Whatever the case at the border, there's now a clear constitutional crisis that will bolster the power of either Congress or the president. It's an outcome that many lawmakers — both supporters and opponents of the president — had hoped to avoid. "I don’t want to see him do that, but it is sad that he is in the position of even having to do that and he would not need to do that had Congress simply done their job and funded the government and funded the wall," Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, said before the president's decision had been confirmed. "Blame Congress." Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., a former secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, said it would be improper for Trump to take money intended for other purposes and shift it to building a wall. "That’s why there’s going to be a legal challenge," she said. "I hope he doesn't do that." Many Republicans, particularly establishment conservatives, have said in recent weeks that it's a bad idea for Trump to use executive powers to circumvent Congress. They envision a Democratic president tapping emergency powers and federal accounts to address liberal wish lists in the future. But on Thursday, it wasn't that hard to find Republicans on Capitol Hill who were fully behind Trump. "If we have a national emergency issue, which we have — we have a crisis going on on the border — then I support his ability to do what he needs to at that point," said Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. Democrats said there was no crisis, other than the political box Trump built for himself by promising his base that he would build the wall in the first place. "This is a fake emergency," said Rep. Joaquín Castro, D-Texas. "In the past, presidents have called national emergencies over national security issues or disasters." Castro said that he is prepared to introduce a measure that would terminate Trump's emergency declaration, which could get a vote in the House but might not see floor action in the Republican-controlled Senate. If the House passes a joint resolution terminating a national emergency, the Senate must either take up the resolution within 18 days, or vote not to consider it within that timeframe. In order to stop the process he launched Friday, the president would have to sign a termination measure, or it would have to get a two-thirds majority over his veto. "I don’t believe he would have the support in the Senate — if they’re required to vote," Castro said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, suggested the same in criticizing the impending move by Trump. “I think it’s a dangerous step," he said. "One, because of the precedent it sets. Two, because the president is going to get sued and it won’t succeed in accomplishing his goal, and three, because I think [Speaker Nancy] Pelosi will then introduce a resolution which will pass the House, then come over here and divide Republicans. So to me, it strikes me as not a good strategy.” In theory, Congress could have gone further to stop Trump from building a wall. The new bill could have included a "none-of-the-funds" provision prohibiting him from using any federal money to build a barrier along the border. But a provision like that would surely have drawn a veto — if it didn't sink the bill in the Senate — and possibly forced another government shutdown. Given its strong desire to avoid that, Congress spoke as forcefully as it could to pre-empt Trump's emergency declaration. Now, the courts will decide who really has the power over the wall.

President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border … one way or the other, we have to do it,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. TRUMP WILL SIGN BORDER SECURITY BILL, DECLARE NATIONAL EMERGENCY, WHITE HOUSE SAYS The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future. But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package. He signed the spending deal Friday afternoon. Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that "walls work" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation. "We’re talking about an invasion of our country," Trump said. And in an almost-casual tone, the president predicted a legal fight that will wind up before the Supreme Court. "We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued," Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration. "Then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake, and we’ll win at the Supreme Court -- just like the [travel] ban.” A senior administration official told Fox News that the White House plans to move $8 billion in currently appropriated or available funds toward construction of the wall. Of that, $3 billion could be diverted with help from the emergency declaration. That money includes about $600 million from the Treasury Department’s forfeiture fund. That money has been described as “easy money” that the White House can use however it wants. The White House is also expected to use drug interdiction money from the Department of Defense. But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Department’s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion. Diverting Pentagon funding, however, is expected to set off a legal battle and has already prompted fierce opposition from Democrats in Congress. "This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. "The President's actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution." They vowed Congress would "defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available." "The President’s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the President from spending money that has not been appropriated. ... This is a gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. This is far from the only declared national emergency. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 "national emergencies" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts. But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress. The president’s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package. The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday. But the deal would provide only a fraction of Trump’s originally proposed figure of $5.7 billion for border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the southern border. The bill also imposed a number of restrictions on the White House, with legislative language preventing the administration from moving funding around to get a barrier or a wall -- a factor that may have contributed to the emergency declaration decision. WHAT IS A 'NATIONAL EMERGENCY' AND HOW CAN TRUMP USE IT TO FUND THE BORDER WALL? The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier. And notably, the word "wall" does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. The funding battle follows the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25—for 35 days—the White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding. Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding. The shutdown left more than 800,000 federal employees and contractors furloughed or working without pay. At the end of last month, though, Trump signed a short-term spending package that funded the government through the Friday deadline. The prior fight left little appetite on either side of the aisle for another shutdown, leading to the passage Thursday of the compromise measure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-off—despite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.

---split---14.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/trumps-executive-order-will-tap-8-billion-in-pentagon-treasury-funds-for-wall-source-says---split---President Donald Trump talks to reporters during a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Senior White House officials said Friday that the funds President Donald Trump will take from the Pentagon and the Treasury Department to pay for his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border would be “back-filled” in his 2020 budget request. That means U.S. taxpayers would pay for every penny of the wall in fiscal 2019 — even though Trump long promised that Mexico would pay for it. Trump is using his executive authorities to move $2.5 billion from the Pentagon’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury Department drug forfeiture program to fund the wall. With the $1.375 billion for fencing along the southern border included in the spending bill he is expected to sign on Friday, that would bring the total for a barrier to $8 billion. [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] Trump is choosing to use his executive authorities because he concluded Congress is “simply incapable” of funding his proposed border barrier, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters on a call Friday morning before the president announced his plan in the Rose Garden. Democrats, however, have simply refused to fund the kind of concrete — and later steel — structure he has talked about since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015. “With the $8 billion, we should have enough money to do what we wanted to do with the $5.7 [billion],” Mulvaney said. He also defended the emergency declaration as Democrats and left-leaning groups already are threatening legal action, noting over the nearly 60 national emergencies declared in the modern era, over 30 remain on the books. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] “It’s not as if he’s waving a magical wand” to tap a special amount of money, Mulvaney said. “The authority … has been on the books since 1976.” Asked from which military construction projects will be tapped, a senior White House official said lower-priority initiatives are being studied — but nothing to hinder “lethality.” Democratic leaders and left-leaning organizations have threatened a court challenge to Trump’s plans. Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Trump and his top aides in recent days had signaled they were searching through the Office of the President’s legal authorities for ways to shift existing funds into the border barrier project. “We have options that most people don’t really understand,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. He also had teased moving monies from “far less important” programs within the federal budget. A senior administration official on Friday said there are no restriction from Congress on the $6.6 billion Trump plans to tap from the Pentagon and Treasury. But in a Thursday statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York were explicit in threatening a legal fight over his emergency declaration. [Trump defends signing national emergency to build border wall] “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities,” the top Democrats said after Pelosi used her weekly press conference to blast Trump for moving toward what she called an “end-run around Congress,” which controls how federal funds are allocated. Left-leaning organizations like Public Citizen said Thursday they intend to sue the president soon after he signs the declaration. Trump’s top spokeswoman, however, brushed off the threat. “We are very prepared, but there shouldn’t be. The president is doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” Sanders told reporters outside her office Thursday. On the Friday call, a second senior official said Democrats are being disingenuous when they claim they held firm and did not help pass a funding measure for Trump’s wall. The official said the administration long ago agreed to the kind of bollard-style fencing already in place in some areas and which the compromise bill would finance.

---split---14.0---split---https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695203852/many-presidents-have-declared-emergencies-but-not-like-trump-has---split---Scott Horsley President Trump announces his emergency declaration during a Rose Garden event at the White House on Friday. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption President Trump announces his emergency declaration during a Rose Garden event at the White House on Friday. In declaring a national emergency Friday, President Trump tried to underscore the urgency of what he calls a national security crisis along the U.S. border with Mexico, while at the same time downplaying the gravity of his response. The president and his advisers couched the emergency declaration as a routine move by the executive branch to redirect money Congress has authorized, just as previous presidents have done dozens of times. Critics scoffed at that argument and accused Trump of an illegal power grab. The emergency declaration is designed to free up more than $6.6 billion for Trump's controversial border wall, after lawmakers rejected the president's demand and approved only a fraction of the wall funding Trump had asked for. Trump insists the extra money is necessary to control an influx of illicit drugs as well as people fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. "We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country," Trump said during a Rose Garden ceremony to announce the emergency declaration, a claim NPR has previously fact-checked. His plan would redirect money from the Defense Department and the Treasury to supplement the $1.375 billion Congress authorized for the wall. The extra money would allow the administration to build more than 230 miles of border barrier, rather than the 55 miles lawmakers approved. The administration insists there is nothing unusual about a president moving money around like that. "This is authority given to the president in law already," acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters. "It's not as if he just didn't get what he wanted so he's waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money." Aides said it's within the president's power to shift some funds around even without declaring an emergency. But the White House says the declaration does give the president some additional flexibility. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, presidents have declared national emergencies 60 times (including Trump) since the power was codified in 1976. Although the law — passed in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and Watergate — gave Congress the right to challenge an emergency declaration, most have been uncontroversial. "There's rarely been a problem," Trump said. "They sign it. Nobody cares. I guess they weren't very exciting." Trump's declaration differs from many of those earlier emergencies. About three-quarters of the time, presidents use their emergency power to impose economic sanctions or limit trade with foreign parties. Then-President Jimmy Carter, for example, declared an emergency to limit business dealings with Iran. George H.W. Bush did the same with Iraq. And Barack Obama used emergency powers to limit transactions with Libya. Other declarations have followed terrorist attacks or natural disasters. George W. Bush declared an emergency after the Sept. 11 attacks. And Obama used one to respond to the swine flu epidemic in 2009. Critics say Trump's declaration is categorically different, in that the president is using his power to fund a border wall far bigger and more expensive than Congress was willing to pay for. "This is not 9/11. This is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979," California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a news conference on Friday after Trump's remarks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the president's actions a clear violation of lawmakers' power to set spending priorities. "This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process," Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, accused the president of "manufacturing a crisis" and diverting money that law enforcement in his state might otherwise use to fight drug dealers. "Our message to the White House is simple and clear," Newsom said in a statement. "California will see you in court." The president grimly anticipated such legal challenges in announcing the emergency. "Sadly we'll be sued," Trump said. "And sadly it will go through a process and happily we'll win, I think."

---split---14.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-declares-national-emergency-to-build-a-wall-162757209.html---split---In a rambling, teleprompter-free diatribe, President Trump announced that he was declaring a national emergency in order to build a wall at the southern border. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Friday morning, after a long digression in which he touched on trade policy with China, the war on ISIS and other subjects, Trump announced he would take executive action to divert federal money to declare a national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.” In doing so, he brought up many of the discredited arguments he has been relying on over the last several months. He said drugs coming across the southern border don’t come through official ports of entry (not true), that El Paso, Texas, was dangerous before the construction of a wall (not true) and that women are being trafficked across the unguarded portions of the border (no evidence exists of this). Trump also disputed studies that have found undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens. An emergency declaration would allow Trump to divert funds appropriated for other purposes to build the wall. Trump has said he would shift the money from “far less important” government programs, including the Department of Defense. A Pentagon official told the New York Times that one likely scenario would be to divert up to $2.5 billion in counternarcotics funds to the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a departure from Trump’s original campaign promise that Mexico would pay for the wall. The administration did not press for money to build a wall during the two years when Republicans had control of both the Senate and House. Illegal border crossings have declined during that time, and the administration has not explained why the border situation is now an emergency. If, as seems likely, there is a constitutional challenge to the declaration, it may hinge in part on Trump’s admission in his remarks that “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this.” A deadlock with Congress over border security issues led to the 35-day partial government shutdown that ended last month. Congress passed a continuing resolution Thursday to fund the government and avert a second shutdown, and Trump has agreed to sign it, but he made no mention of it in his remarks.  President @realDonaldTrump signs the Declaration for a National Emergency to address the national security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border. pic.twitter.com/0bUhudtwvS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the option of triggering a vote on Trump’s declaration, forcing Republicans to go on the record about whether they support the emergency wall. Two Democratic representatives, Joaquin Castro of Texas and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have already announced plans to introduce a resolution that would terminate the emergency declaration. But even if the declaration survives congressional challenges over appropriations, actually building the wall could face legal challenges from landowners along the border whose property would need to be acquired. Trump acknowledged that this act would likely face a legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was supportive of Trump declaring a national emergency, many of his Republican colleagues were less enthusiastic. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called it a “bad idea,” Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said it was “of dubious constitutionality” and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said, “It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past.” On Thursday, Pelosi warned that a future Democratic president could use the precedent of declaring a national emergency for other purposes, such as gun control, citing the anniversary of the Parkland, Fla., mass shooting that left 17 dead. "Because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he’s created as an emergency, an illusion he wants to convey, just think what a president with different values could present to the American people,” said Pelosi. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let's talk about today. The one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would. But a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare emergencies as well." All the major network and cable news outlets carried Trump’s Rose Garden announcement live. But as the president’s rambling speech wore on, CBS cut away and returned to its regularly scheduled programming — which, on the East Coast, was “The Price Is Right.” Trump’s declaration of a national emergency came hours before he was scheduled to depart the White House for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for the weekend.

The dig resembled the heavy heaping of shade Mariah Carey delivered to Jennifer Lopez while speaking to the paparazzi in the early 2000s.

In response, Trump decided to rattle off the names of far-right personalities he liked and why: “Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,” he remarked, adding: “Rush Limbaugh I think he is a great guy ... and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.” Trump says he doesn't have time to talk to Ann Coulter, adding "she's off the reservation." pic.twitter.com/5ntb0ZWCYG When the reporter interrupted to ask if they were deciding his policies, however, Trump responded with: “They don’t decide policy. In fact, if I went opposite — they have somebody, Ann Coulter, I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. But the press loves saying ‘Ann Coulter.’ Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time to speak to her,” Trump said. But he didn’t stop there. “I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason. When they asked her, like right at the beginning, ‘Who’s going to win the election?’ She said ‘Donald Trump.’” He then ended his comments on the controversial pundit with a racially insensitive idiom, saying: “But, she’s off the reservation. But anybody who knows her understands that.” The far-right, anti-immigration and anti-Muslim personality —who was an early and vocal Trump supporter — eventually turned on Trump for failing to deliver the promised border wall. On Friday, Coulter responded to Trump’s comments on Twitter, saying: “This is not Paul Ryan’s fault. It’s not Mitch McConnell’s fault. Trump ran AGAINST the GOP and won. Responsibility is 100% his.” This is not Paul Ryan’s fault. It’s not Mitch McConnell’s fault. Trump ran AGAINST the GOP and won. Responsibility is 100% his. People on Twitter seemed to relish her frustration. Yes, Trump's... and the 60 million suckers you helped lure into his trap. Heckuva job, @AnnCoulter! “Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie?

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist U.S. political discussion has been dominated by the issue of Donald Trump’s wall — an issue on which Trump's irrationality keeps surprising even his critics. So I don’t imagine that many people have heard about Trump’s nomination of David Malpass, currently an under secretary at the Treasury Department, to lead the World Bank. But it’s a story worth following. For one thing, while the U.S. traditionally gets to choose the World Bank’s president (Europe gets the International Monetary Fund), there will be a lot of opposition to Malpass, who has a history of being hostile to international institutions. Furthermore, the Malpass nomination highlights the remarkable character of Trump’s economic appointments. Remarkable in what way? Well, remarkably bad. Every economist, yours truly very much included, gets it wrong sometimes. But Trump only seems to choose men who have been wrong about everything. Beyond that, however, what’s remarkable is the extent to which this president consistently chooses economists whose ideology is at odds with his own professed views on policy. [Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool, moving from a career as a world-class economist to writing hard-hitting opinion columns. For an even deeper look at what’s on his mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.] These days, at least, Trump is an easy-money guy who wants the Fed to keep interest rates low. But he keeps appointing deflationists — men who opposed any attempt to rescue the economy from the financial crisis, who bitterly attacked the Fed for keeping rates low and demanded tight money even when we had very high unemployment. Why does he do this? I’ll get there in a minute. First, let’s talk about who’s on the Trump team. At the top of the list is Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. He has quite a track record; as one commentator put it, he “has elevated flamboyant wrongness into a form of performance art.” Kudlow may be best known for his unflagging faith, in the teeth of the evidence, in the magic of tax cuts, as well as his dismissal of “bubbleheads” who predicted a housing crash. Less known is his 2008 praise for Bush officials for having the courage not to bail out Lehman Brothers. Just hours after his encomiums, Lehman’s fall had plunged the whole world into financial meltdown. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is another bubble denier, although his most famous prediction was in his 1999 book “Dow 36,000” (which, adjusted for inflation, would mean roughly Dow 55,000 today). More relevant to current policy, Hassett was among those who kept predicting, wrongly, that Ben Bernanke’s efforts to fight unemployment would cause runaway inflation. And then there’s David Malpass, also both a bubble denier and a Bernanke-basher. Much press commentary has noted his 2007 insistence, as chief economist at Bear Stearns, that there was no reason to be worried about the financial system. A few months later his own firm imploded. But I think his most revealing piece of commentary was a 2011 screed against low interest rates and what he considered a “weak dollar” policy. A low rate policy, he declared, hurts the economy because it “discourages thrift,” while the weak dollar was bad for confidence, or something. This was really bad economics. At the time, America had 9 percent unemployment, entirely because of inadequate private spending; to the extent that low interest rates were discouraging thrift and making people spend rather than save, that would have been a good thing, not a problem. And Malpass’s argument about the dollar was just incoherent. What’s really striking, however, is that the policies Malpass attacked were precisely the policies Donald Trump now demands: low rates and a weaker dollar. So why would Trump want to promote him, and people like him? Here’s how I understand it: The first thing Trump looks for in an appointee is someone who shares his values — above all, his absolute lack of compassion for those less fortunate than himself. And if you want an economic official who doesn’t care about the poor or the unlucky, you must perforce go for a right-winger. But Trump also has another criterion: He wants people who will be personally dependent on him, who don’t have any kind of professional reputation to defend and therefore won’t take a stand on principle. That is, he only wants hacks. And here’s the thing: Right-wing hack economists are, with hardly any exceptions, hard-money, hyperinflation-is-around-the-corner types. So Trump ends up with officials whose past views are diametrically opposed to what he says now. Does this mean that the men he has chosen will stand in the way of his policies? No, not at all. They are hacks, after all, and will tell Trump whatever he wants to hear. But it does mean that Trumpian economic policy is being made by men who, almost by definition, don’t know what they’re doing. To have gotten their jobs, they not only had to have track records of talking nonsense, but to have suddenly started talking completely different nonsense — reversing their long-held positions to curry favor with the Very Stable Genius. So what will happen if and when this economic team has to deal with real problems, like a global slump? Somehow, I’m not optimistic.

---split---15.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-defends-signing-national-emergency-build-border-wall---split---Donald Trump speaks on border security during a Rose Garden event at the White House on Friday. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) President Donald Trump defended his executive action to access $6.6 billion in Pentagon and Treasury Department funds for his southern border barrier, accusing Democrats of opposing it as part of a “big con” and “a lie.” Trump said Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Charles E. Schumer “know” border walls work, but they are resisting his proposal purely for political reasons. “We fight wars that we should never have been in many cases,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. “But we don’t defend our border. … Walls work 100 percent.” [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] The president revealed his likely legal strategy in defending his move in court, saying he acted for “invasion purposes.” The president did not speak from a teleprompter, and he did not appear to be reading from a binder he carried to his podium. His border and immigration remarks soon resembled a tamer version of one of his campaign rallies. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said. He opened the press conference with rambling statements that touched on everything from China and UK trade talks to the Islamic State to Syria to the state of the economy and the stock market. Once he was back on topic, he called a national emergency “a great thing to do” and again claimed undocumented migrants are carrying out an “invasion” of the United States. “We want to stop gangs” and “drugs from coming into our country,” he said before veering off into attacks on Democrats. He claimed that if Democrats had won the presidency in 2016, the economy would not be “going through the roof.” [Republicans have concerns about Trump’s emergency declaration, too] Trump took a swipe at Democrats, saying “they didn’t even fight us” during a conference committee’s negotiations on matters like bolstering security at ports of entry. He said the other border security funds in the bill he will sign later is “crazy,” adding “I don’t even know what to do with it.” The White House announced Thursday that Trump would sign a seven-agency spending measure that includes $1.375 billion for fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also confirmed the president will tap his executive authorities for billions more. “If we had the wall, it would be very easy,” he said of stopping migrants from reaching American soil. “That’s the story: We want to have a very safe country.” Though Democratic leaders and left-leaning organizations quickly threatened court challenges, Trump said the national emergency he is triggering Friday allows him to shift $3.5 billion from the Defense Department’s military construction fund into the boundary barrier project. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] In a new twist he hinted at all week, Trump is also issuing an executive order to transfer $2.5 billion from the military’s drug interdiction initiative and $600 million from a Treasury drug forfeiture program into the border project. Trump said the military would not be impacted because he is taking “a small amount” from its budget that now exceeds $700 billion. Trump said he signed emergency declaration documents Friday because of the “invasion” of undocumented migrants, which he again claimed bring drugs and crime into the country. Democrats and immigration experts say his claims are overblown, however. Trump had created confusion during the presser saying he had signed the order but would sign the final documents after he went back into the Oval Office. At about 2:20 p.m., White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Trump had signed the spending bill. She tweeted a picture at about 11 a.m. depicting Trump signing a document identified as the emergency declaration.

---split---16.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-checking-trump-s-speech-declaring-national-emergency-border-wall-n972116---split---President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in an effort of unlock funds for his promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, delivering a freewheeling speech that included a number of false or misleading claims. From the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump spoke and took questions from reporters for nearly an hour, touching on immigration, his emergency declaration, China and more as he pressed the need for a wall to counter what he called an "invasion" threatening the southern border. Here's what the president said, and the facts. Border fencing is essential "because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into the country," Trump said Friday, later saying the country is facing an "invasion" of drugs. "With a wall, it would be very easy" to stop drugs and crime from entering the U.S., he said. But it's unlikely a border wall would have much effect on the illegal drug trade. Drugs primarily come into the U.S. through ports of entry and through the mail, not through unsecured portions of the southern border, according to the government's own data. "When you look and when you listen to politicians — particular certain Democrats, they say it all comes through the port of entry. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's just a lie," Trump said. It's Trump who has his facts wrong here. Government reports have repeatedly shown that illegal drugs primarily enter the country through ports of entry. And it's not just Democrats who have publicly acknowledged this information. Trump's then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly — who went on to become White House chief of staff, until December 2018 — said in April 2017 that illegal drug traffic “mostly comes through the ports of entry.” Border barriers between the U.S. and Mexico do not have a perfect success rate. These fences have been cut through, dug under and climbed over in the past. To reduce illegal crossings, border authorities have recommended, and requested in budgets, a combination of fencing, technology and other enforcement efforts. Speaking about crime and violence, Trump said "it was not only better, it was 100 percent better" when a border barrier was constructed in El Paso, Texas. Crime data published by the FBI shows otherwise, as NBC News reported in a fact check earlier this month. Violent crime has been dropping in El Paso since its modern-day peak in 1993 and was at historical lows before a fence was authorized by Congress in 2006. Violent crime actually ticked up during the border fence's construction and after its completion in 2009, law enforcement data shows. The president repeatedly used the word "invasion" to describe the situation at the southern border, pointing particularly to drugs, crime and human trafficking. But there's little evidence the southern border is experiencing a new state of emergency. Violence isn’t spilling over the border, and terrorists aren’t being caught in droves trying to cross it. Illegal drugs largely come through legal ports of entry, not unguarded parts of the border, according to border authorities. Illegal border crossings have been dropping for years, and while border apprehensions have risen in recent months, they are still markedly lower than they were 20 years ago, Customs and Border Protection data shows. And though Trump has focused on the border, illegal immigration in the U.S. is being driven by another factor: people who overstay their visas. More than 701,900 people overstayed their visas during fiscal year 2017, according to the Department of Homeland Security. People who overstay their visas usually enter the country through an airport, not from the border. “Right now China is paying us billions of dollars in tariffs and I haven't even gotten started," Trump said. Trump misstates how tariffs work. Foreign nations do not pay tariffs directly to the U.S., and often, American consumers ending up footing the bill. Tariffs are a fee charged by the U.S. when a good is brought into the country. They're designed to make foreign-made goods more expensive — thus boosting domestic producers — but that expense, charged to the importer, is typically passed down to American consumers. “We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters. Thousands. They’re out of this country. We take them out by the thousands. And they are monsters,” Trump claimed. While the U.S. does deport thousands of people with suspected gang ties each year, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has stepped up its efforts, Trump is likely inflating the number of MS-13 gang members who are included in that number. In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. arrested 4,818 people with gang ties. That number included fewer than 800 MS-13 members. In fiscal year 2018, ICE removed nearly 6,000 known or suspected gang members, the agency reported. But the report did not indicate how many of those people had a connection to MS-13. Many MS-13 members are U.S. citizens — the gang was first formed in Los Angeles — and cannot be deported. This is the case with many gang operations. In one large gang-targeting operation led by ICE in 2017, 1,378 individuals were arrested. Of those, 933 were U.S. citizens. "President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs. And it’s a criminal penalty, and the penalty is death. That’s frankly one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal," he said. Fentanyl and many similar substances have been a controlled substance in China for years, The Associated Press reported recently, and Trump is misstating what the Chinese government agreed to do as part of ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Xi agreed to regulate all substances similar to fentanyl in the same way as they regulate fentanyl, which would help the U.S. address the opioid epidemic by keeping it out of the U.S. Still, the AP added, China has previously promised to stop exporting substances the U.S. considers illegal — even if they are legal in China — but has failed to make good. “And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars. And it's unnecessary,” Trump said. The Department of Homeland Security does not release data on how much illegal immigration costs the country. Immigration experts previously told NBC News that a precise figure is nearly impossible to ascertain. That's in part because undocumented immigrants operate within the shadows, leaving their full fiscal contributions — and use of taxpayer-funded resources — at least somewhat unknown. Trump has previously claimed the U.S. loses between $200, $250 and $275 billion a year on illegal immigration, numbers that experts across the political spectrum said were probably an exaggeration. Conservative groups believe the figure could be several billions a month, but Trump isn’t getting that number from the government. Jane C.

---split---16.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/media/trump-hannity-limbaugh-coulter.html---split---Supported by By Edmund Lee President Trump reeled off a list of his favorite media personalities on Friday when asked who might have influenced his decision to declare a national emergency after Congress refused to give him money for a border wall. Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — a powerful bloc of conservative voices who have railed against any budget compromise on wall funding — all received shout-outs in a Rose Garden news conference. “Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,” Mr. Trump said of the Fox News commentator. He praised Mr. Limbaugh for his ability to command an audience. “He can speak for three hours without a phone call,” Mr. Trump said. “Try doing that sometime. For three hours he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable.” The president added that none of the favorites he mentioned, most of whom work for Fox News, drove his decisions: “They don’t decide policy,” he said. The question that got Mr. Trump to discuss his cable and radio cheering squad came from the NBC News reporter Kelly O’Donnell. It seemed apt after what had occurred in December, when the presidency seemed perhaps more entwined than usual with prominent figures in conservative media. At the time, Mr. Trump appeared willing to sign a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown, even without money for the wall. Then a few of his most influential supporters, including Mr. Hannity and Mr. Limbaugh, lasered in on the lack of wall funding and pleaded with Mr. Trump to refuse to sign the bill. He did exactly that, leading to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the government’s history. This week, as the deadline on the temporary spending measure that ended the shutdown loomed, the president was willing to go ahead with a newly proposed budget, even though it had less money for a border wall than was on the table at one point last year. In contrast to December, Mr. Trump reached out to a synod of conservative commentators in an effort to assuage their concerns. He talked with Mr. Hannity and Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host. The purpose was to politick the right-wing media with the message that Mr. Trump deserved support for the new bill because he had forced concessions. He also would declare a national emergency as a way to get around Congress and provide dollars for the wall, a move conservatives championed. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. “It’s an invasion. We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.” But not everyone in the right-wing punditocracy endorsed Mr. Trump. Ann Coulter, who was an early supporter of the president, has now become a thorn in his side. In December, she published a blistering column on her website calling Mr. Trump a “gigantic douchebag” for not having made headway on a border wall. This week, as many anticipated Mr. Trump’s willingness to approve the spending bill, she didn’t let up, saying on Twitter that the goal of the national emergency “is for Trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years.” The president spoke of Ms. Coulter on Friday, but not in the most glowing terms. “I don’t know her,” the president said Friday. "I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. But the press loves saying ‘Ann Coulter.’” He continued: “I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason. When they asked her, right at the beginning, who is going to win the election? She said, ‘Donald Trump.’ And the two people that asked her that question smiled. They said, ‘You’re kidding, aren’t you?’ ‘Nope, Donald Trump.’ So I like her.” A few seconds later, he added, “But she’s off the reservation, but anybody who knows her understands that.” After the news conference, Ms. Coulter tweeted: “He seems to think ‘the reservation’ is HIM, not his campaign promises.” Three minutes later, she posted another, this time about the constitutional provision allowing for the removal of a president from office: “No. 1 trending topic on Twitter: 25th Amendment.” Mr. Trump also cued up one of his old anti-press hits during the news conference. When Jim Acosta, the CNN reporter whose White House credentials he suspended late last year, asked about “critics who say you’re creating a national emergency in order to get your wall,” the president was ready. “Your question is a very political question, because you have an agenda,” he said. “You’re CNN. You’re fake news.” Advertisement

The president also made a comment about Chinese President Xi Jinping that many Twitter users believe mocked the man’s accent. At one point during the speech, Trump was discussing the United States’ drug problem and mentioned a discussion he had with Xi, claiming the Chinese president told him drug dealers are executed in China. “Their criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty,” Trump said. “Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, ‘how about a fine.’” “When I asked President Xi — I said, ‘Do you have a drug problem?’ ‘No, no, no,’” Trump told the crowd, saying he then asked how a country with 1.4 billion people didn’t have a drug problem. “I said, ‘Why?’” Trump said, before seeming to mimic Xi’s accent: “‘Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs. End of problem.’” Here's the moment when President Trump affected a fake "Chinese" accent to imitate China's President Xi Jinping. "We give death penalty to people that sell drugs," Trump said, imitating Xi. "End of story." pic.twitter.com/GzAPqsNL8u Trump’s imitation didn’t get high marks from many Twitter users: OMG! Trump really did a racist impression of Xi. What’s next?

Pure improv. #RacistJazzman Trump mocked accent / voice of Chinese leader. He might as well have said, “no ticky- no laundry” OMG!

---split---17.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-lawmakers-vow-fight-trump-s-emergency-declaration-n972091---split---WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders said Friday that they would use "every remedy available" to challenge President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency in an effort to circumvent Congress and fund his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. "This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement as Trump announced the emergency declaration in the White House Rose Garden. "The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available," they added. Trump acknowledged Friday that his executive action will draw lawsuits, and Democrats have threatened to fight the declaration through legislation, as well. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who determines the House floor schedule, vowed in a statement Thursday that "House Democrats will challenge this irresponsible declaration." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, confirmed in a tweet Friday that she and Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, plan to introduce a joint resolution to terminate the emergency declaration, something House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Thursday that he fully supports. The pair "aren't going to let the president declare a fake national emergency without a fight," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. A joint resolution would not take effect unless both chambers of Congress passed it and either the president signed it or Congress overrode a veto. Trump will "absolutely veto" congressional efforts to stop him, a Trump aide said Friday morning. With the national emergency declared, Trump will have access to roughly $8 billion for the wall, which includes the $1.375 billion appropriation included in the funding package that Congress passed Thursday. It would also include $600 million in Treasury forfeiture, $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program and $3.6 billion in military construction from the Defense Department, according to a senior White House official. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Army Corps of Engineers, said in a statement Friday that Congress can’t allow Trump to "steal funds" from civil works programs as well as flood prevention and reconstruction projects in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. "Past national security emergencies have involved hurricanes, wildfires, hostage crises, epidemics and public health emergencies and terrorist attacks posing grave and immediate risk to American lives. The situation at the border clearly falls short," she said. A number of Republicans have expressed concern with the declaration, as well, and warned Trump that it sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., a former member of House GOP leadership, said in a statement Thursday that she doesn’t support Trump’s decision and that it “sets a very dangerous precedent that undermines our constitutional separation of powers.” “By circumventing Congress and Article I of the Constitution, President Trump is opening the door for any future president to act alone without Congressional approval,” she said. “If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?” Several congressional Democrats have said that it could lead to Democratic presidents declaring national emergencies to address issues like gun violence and climate change, which they say are more pressing than building a wall on the border. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Friday: “100 people die from guns every day. That’s a national emergency. If Trump gets away w this border emergency declaration, then a Dem President can declare a gun violence emergency and institute universal background checks and an assault weapons ban by executive action." "The Founders afforded Congress alone with the constitutional power of the purse," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee which negotiated the spending deal, in a statement Friday. "In the days and weeks ahead, the President’s emergency declaration — which amounts to an end run around both the Constitution and Congress — will be challenged both in the courts and in Congress." “A national emergency declaration for a nonemergency is void. A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act," Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., tweeted Friday, adding that Trump "is attempting to circumvent our constitutional system." Trump dismissed those in his party who criticized his plans as unconstitutional. "Not too many people have said that. But the courts will determine that. I expect to be sued," Trump told reporters during the White House event. GOP leaders expressed support for the declaration, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McConnell, who was the first to publicly reveal the president's decision Thursday, defended the White House move in a Friday statement. "President Trump’s decision to announce emergency action is the predictable and understandable consequence of Democrats’ decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest," he said. Some Democrats argued Friday that a real emergency would stop Trump from traveling to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the holiday weekend. "Anyone else out there playing emergency golf this weekend?" tweeted Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, on Friday. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., also noted how Trump rambled throughout his off-the-cuff remarks Friday, which the president opened by talking about negotiations with China. “This bizarre, rambling speech about everything that passes through the president's mind is not exactly conveying the sense of urgency which most people would associate with a national emergency,” he tweeted. “If there was a real #NationalEmergency, POTUS would lead with that instead of talking about a bunch of other issues,” added Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y. Rebecca Shabad is a congressional reporter for NBC News, based in Washington. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

Please read the rules before joining the discussion. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday to free up billions of dollars for a border wall. It's a highly controversial move that Democrats and some Republicans have criticized as an overreach of his power. USA TODAY President Trump has officially declared an "emergency" on the southern border so that he can build his wall. I won't go into all the reasons why this emergency is bogus or why, even after declaring an emergency, he still won't be able to build his wall. Instead, I want to discuss why willfully damaging our democratic institutions for a little short-term political gain is a very bad, very unAmerican, idea. If there is any emergency at all here, it's a political one. President Trump felt no pressing need for the wall for the last two years and nothing of emergency proportions on the ground has changed. What has changed is control of the House. When Republicans lost their unified control of Congress, President Trump lost any chance whatsoever of fulfilling his "Build the wall!" promise that his base loves so much. So the "emergency" here is that President Trump isn't able to get Congress to agree to what he wants. If he's unable to build his wall, even his most dedicated fans will turn on him. That may seem like an emergency to President Trump, but it certainly isn't the kind of thing that could, even theoretically, justify making an end-run around Congress. People booing Donald Trump at his rallies is not the equivalent of the zombie apocalypse. TOPSHOT - This photo shows the border fence near New Mexico's Highway 9, near Santa Teresa on December 23, 2018. - The US government began a Christmastime shutdown early on December 22, after Congress adjourned without passing a federal spending bill or addressing President Donald Trump's demand for money to build a border wall. (Photo by Paul Ratje / AFP)PAUL RATJE/AFP/Getty Images ORIG FILE ID: AFP_1BT2GG (Photo11: PAUL RATJE, AFP/Getty Images) The old saying that what goes around comes around is nowhere more true than in politics. The reason that Donald Trump and the Republican Senate have been confirming very conservative judges at a breakneck pace isn't down to Mitch McConnell's political savvy. It's because Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader, decided to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominations so that it would be easier for Democrats to confirm more liberal judges. How's that working for you, Harry? More commentary: Trump emergency sets precedent Republicans will regret Donald Trump doesn't have a dog or a sense of humor. Presidents need both. As an undocumented worker, I cleaned Trump's golf club. Now, I'm a voice for all immigrants. President Trump's declaration of an "emergency" on the southern border is exactly the same thing. Someday, Democrats will control the presidency and won't be able to get, say, a Republican Senate to take action on one of their pet issues. If President Trump can declare an emergency to expropriate land and build his wall, some future president will be able to declare an emergency to shut coal mines and build windmills. Nor is this threat fanciful as numerous Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi herself, have made the warning — or perhaps, threat — explicit. Rep.Emmanuel Cleaver tweeted, “Gun violence is a national emergency. Climate Change is a national emergency. Income inequality is a national emergency. Access to healthcare is a national emergency. Building a wall on the southern border is not." None of these things are even a remotely acceptable reason for attempting to circumvent our constitutional system of government and the ordinary legislative process. And I think it is safe to say that every Republican in Congress would be violently opposed to any effort by a Democrat to do so. But sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and if Republicans are unwilling to oppose President Trump declaring an emergency because he is unable to get Congress to pass the legislation he wants, they won't be able to object when President Sanders does the same thing. Our democratic institutions are far more important than whatever the issue of the day happens to be. Twenty years from now, no one will remember whatever it is that seems so important to us today. But our institutions endure and if we damage them, everyone will remember what we have done, whether twenty years from now or a hundred. There is nothing that can justify opening the door — even a crack — to the idea that a president is entitled to rule by decree when politics and our constitutional system of government become inconvenient. Fortunately, Congress will have an opportunity to reject President Trump’s emergency declaration. The National Emergencies Act allows Congress to pass a joint resolution overturning an emergency declaration. If the President vetoes the resolution, both houses of Congress would have to vote to overturn his veto by a 2/3 margin to terminate the emergency. This is a steep hill to climb but not an impossible one, especially when there is so much at stake. Declaring an emergency in the absence of one is an affront to our constitutional system of government and the rule of law itself. Our southern border isn't facing an emergency, but our democratic institutions are. No president should ever be allowed to invoke "emergency" powers simply because they can't get what they want through the normal political process. That is a gross abuse of the Office of the Presidency and sets a dangerous precedent for future presidential administrations. Every American, regardless of party, should oppose it. Congressional Republicans, in particular, need to stand up to President Trump and block this emergency declaration. If they do not, they will have no one to blame but themselves for what comes next.

---split---17.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-wings-it-in-testy-combative-rose-garden-emergency-announcement---split---\President Donald Trump speaks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday. Trump said he would declare a national emergency to free up federal funding to build a wall along the southern border. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) ANALYSIS — A testy and combative President Donald Trump winged it Friday in the Rose Garden, turning an often-rambling defense of his border security emergency into a 2020 assault on Democrats. Trump has redefined the presidency around his unique style and penchant for unpredictable and unprecedented moves, as well as the sharp rhetoric he uses both at the White House and his rowdy campaign rallies. But there was something different during Trump’s remarks Friday, with the president leading off his remarks by talking about anything but the compromise funding measure and border security actions he signed later that day. He lauded his “very good relationship” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and touted their second denuclearization summit later this month, even talking up that country’s economic potential. On Chinese President Xi Jinping, again, Trump talked about their rosy relationship and predicted: “We’re a lot closer in this country than we ever were with having a real trade deal” with Beijing — yet he struggled to note specific things that might be in the potential deal. Out of the blue, and with no teleprompter loaded with prepared remarks, he announced his administration is planning a trade deal with the United Kingdom that amounts to “increasing very substantially” trade between the longtime allies. Back on Kim, he said: “No more rockets going up, no more missiles going up, no more test of nuclear,” even though his own intelligence chiefs say North Korea has not taken steps to dismantle its nuclear programs. About an hour later came his both-sides-of-the-mouth dismissal of the notion, as NBC News’ Norah O’Donnell asked, that Fox News and conservative personalities are “setting policy.” He also said many conservative television and radio personalities have been “terrific” supporters of both his candidacy and campaign. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] For instance, despite noting that conservative commentator Ann Coulter was among the first to predict his 2016 victory, Trump, as he often does, sent mixed signals: “I like her. But she’s off the reservation,” he said to chuckles from the press corps and his own staff who were assembled on the nearby colonnade. Coulter has publicly criticized Trump in recent months for not building the border wall. Watch: Trump announces national emergency on border, despite likely legal challenge It was a few minutes before a sun-drenched Trump launched into his usual border security and illegal immigration talking points. He at first appeared flat and frustrated. But he eventually hit his stride — and the uniquely unscripted president fell into campaign mode, turning a venue typically reserved for staid and stately events into a rally. And it wasn’t long before he launched a string of attacks on congressional Democrats, including two of his favorite targets who are vastly unpopular with his conservative base. “Nancy knows it. Chuck knows it. They all know it. It’s a big lie. It’s a big con game,” he said of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, contending that large loads of drugs or humans being trafficked only cross the U.S.-Mexico border in “areas where you don’t have a wall.” “You don’t have to be very smart to know, you put up a barrier, people … can’t do anything,” Trump said. He spoke of “monstrous caravans” heading for the U.S.-Mexico border, saying several times he opted to declare a national emergency and issue an executive order to access $6.6 billion in Pentagon and Treasury Department dollars for his border barrier project because “we are talking about an invasion.” (The bipartisan spending measure he signed includes $1.375 billion, taking the total to roughly $8 billion — though court cases are inevitable. One could come from the Democratic leaders he once again slammed.) But the president did not appear eager at times to stick to the day’s purported topic. Soon, he was back to criticizing Beijing’s trade tactics and touting the U.S. economy’s performance since he took office. “We’ve picked up … trillions of dollars of worth,” he asserted. “And China’s lost trillions of dollars.” Then he swerved to a preview of a new round of trade talks with Chinese officials next week in Washington. After briefly getting back on track, Trump opted for another abrupt swipe at Democrats. “If the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes,” he said, then explaining that his economy means “more people want to come.” The implication: He needs his wall to keep more of those additional migrants out, and he’s willing to take on Democrats and outside groups in court to build it. [Legal fight expected for Trump’s national emergency declaration] And once the president took questions, the campaign rally continued as he lashed out at CNN’s Jim Acosta. “You’re CNN. You’re fake news. You have an agenda,” Trump said. “It’s a fake question.” And Playboy’s Brian Karem got what has become a Trump press conference staple when the president ordered him to “sit down.” Above all, Trump’s tone and body language suggested a chief executive who is frustrated after having to take historically extreme measures to merely move a top campaign promise forward. “I got almost $1.4 billion dollars when I wasn’t supposed to even get one dollar,” Trump said, mocking Pelosi’s statement that she would only give him a buck for the barrier in the spending measure both chambers passed with bipartisan tallies Thursday. “But I’m not happy with it.” And he clearly knows court challenges of his pending funding shifts are coming. But again, he seemed less confident than he typically does in public. “Happily, we’ll win,” he said. “I think.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---19.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/trumps-wall-words-will-used---split---Protesters erect a cardboard wall in front of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas in 2016. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) If there were a hall of fame of legal self-owns, there would be a spot of honor for a line Friday from President Donald Trump as he announced that he would declare a national emergency to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. To do so, Trump plans in part to use the National Emergency Act of 1976, but he undercut his argument that it was an emergency at all. “I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said from the Rose Garden, “but I’d rather do it much faster.” The next sound was lawyers across the country frantically adding Trump’s words to lawsuits to stop the president’s action. “Whatever a national emergency may be, that’s not it,” Supreme Court litigator Neal Katyal said. “That quote is going right in the lawsuit.” And there was little doubt about how prominent it should be. “That’s plaintiffs’ Exhibit A,” said Elizabeth Goitein, a national security expert at the Brennan Center. “Consider putting this on page 1,” Supreme Court litigator Deepak Gupta tweeted to any lawyers crafting petitions. “This quote should be the first sentence of the first paragraph of every complaint filed this afternoon,” said conservative appellate lawyer George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. And Omar Jadwat, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has called the emergency declaration an abuse of presidential power, tweeted: “keep talking mr president.” Trump’s statement, directly contrary to his interests, isn’t necessarily a silver bullet for challengers. And it doesn’t mean that the federal courts ultimately will stop Trump from using his powers to shift about $6.7 billion from the Defense and Treasury departments for the project. But it makes life tougher for the Justice Department lawyers who will defend the emergency declaration and ensures that, much like Trump’s travel ban, the president’s words will play a key role in the legal fight over his actions. The ACLU announced Friday that it would file a lawsuit early next week. “By the president’s very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency,” executive director Anthony Romero said. The central question will be whether the national emergency is actually a pretext to get around the Constitution’s requirement that Congress is in charge of appropriations. For lawmakers and other critics already pointing to immigration, crime and drug trafficking statistics to argue there is no emergency on the border, Trump’s line amazed. “Trump’s own admission that this is not a national emergency,” Missouri Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II tweeted in response to the line. “You can't make this stuff up.” “Hint: if you ‘didn't need’ to do it, then it wasn't an emergency, to begin with,” California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill said. Trump also used the Friday announcement to describe what he thought would happen with the legal challenges to the emergency declaration, and it tracks fairly close to what many legal experts predict could happen. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling, and then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully, we’ll get a fair shake, and we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the [travel] ban,” Trump said. Trump’s words about national security were also prominent in the travel ban fight. As a candidate, he had called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” and challengers argued that and other statements showed the ban was actually a pretext for a discriminatory “Muslim ban.” Lower courts stopped the ban. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision in June that split the court along familiar ideological lines, ultimately ruled that Trump had a sufficient national security justification for a policy that on its face “says nothing about religion.” Still, the travel ban case showed that conservative justices are reluctant to second guess a president’s judgment about what is a national emergency and might be even more so when it comes to the wall, since Congress not only gave the president broad authority but still has the ability to take it away. “My initial assessment is that what President Trump announced is legal,” Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said. “Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter. Congress has been ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back.” The setting of Friday’s line matters, too. In the legal battle over the travel ban, the government tried to dismiss the relevance of Trump’s statements because he made them as a candidate, said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. “That won’t be an option here,” Gorod said. Even before Friday’s line, Goitein, of the Brennan Center, made the case that Trump was undercutting his national security claim by waiting more than three weeks since he first publicly spoke about using the process to get funding for a wall. “Of course, Trump’s hesitation also belies his claim that there is an emergency at the border,” Goitein wrote in The Atlantic. “Presidents don’t dawdle in the face of real emergencies.” Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

USA TODAY WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump faced immediate blowback on Friday for his assertion that his predecessor in the Oval Office, Barack Obama, was on the brink of starting "a big war" with North Korea. Trump made the claim during a rambling news conference on Friday, in which he declared a national emergency to free up federal money for his controversial border wall, suggested he would delay a deadline for hiking tariffs on China, and touted his success in negotiations with North Korea. Trump said Obama told him North Korea's nuclear weapons program presented the greatest threat to the United States during a 2016 meeting in the White House just after Trump won the presidential election. "He told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea," Trump recounted. "It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the Obama administration was considering anything like that," said Michael Fuchs, who served as Obama's deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. He said Trump was simply "lying" about that exchange. Other top Obama advisers also sharply refuted Trump's claim. "We were not on the brink of war with North Korea in 2016," Ben Rhodes, a former national security adviser to Obama, tweeted on Friday. Rhodes suggested that Trump didn't understand Obama's 2016 description of the threat North Korea posed. We were not on the brink of war with North Korea in 2016. Highlighting the longstanding and widely known threat of North Korea’s nuclear program is very different from saying you’re about to start a big war. John Brennan, Obama's former CIA director, said that while he was not in the room during that meeting, "President Obama was never on the verge of starting any war with North Korea, large or small." Obama viewed North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons with "deep concern, and he constantly pressed his national security team to present options to reduce the threat from North Korea," but war was not among those options, Brennan told NBC News. President Donald Trump declares a "national emergency" to free up funds for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 15, 2019. (Photo11: ERIK S. LESSER, EPA-EFE) Experts say any military strike against North Korea would almost certainly result in massive loss of life in South Korea and is far too risky to contemplate. Fuchs said such a move would not only result in "mass casualties" for the South Koreans, but it could "easily spiral" into a greater regional conflict involving the use of nuclear weapons. "The list of disasters that could be created by a conflict with North Korea are ... too unthinkable to consider," Fuchs said. He and other experts argue that it was Trump who ratcheted up the danger of a military confrontation with North Korea when he took office in 2017, threatening Kim Jong Un's regime with "fire and fury," among other provocative statements and actions. Now, critics said, Trump is trying to claim credit for progress in negotiations aimed at pressing Kim's regime to relinquish his nuclear arsenal. "This is again the president, when it comes to North Korea, attempting to play the role of both arsonist and firefighter – acting like there was some big emergency that he saved everyone from," Fuchs told USA TODAY. Trump is scheduled to hold a second summit with the North Korean dictator later this month in Vietnam. The two men held a high-profile summit last year in Singapore, where they signed a vaguely worded agreement in which North Korea promised to work toward a “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” On Friday, Trump argued the talks with North Korea have resulted in significant progress, noting that Kim's regime has stopped testing missiles and has returned American hostages, among other steps. But the North Koreans have not taken any visible, concrete steps toward fulfilling that pledge, and Trump's own advisers acknowledge that North Korea is still developing a nuclear weapons program. Trump's top intelligence chief recently warned that North Korea was "unlikely" to ever give up its nuclear weapons. Trump also addressed his administration's bitter trade negotiations with China, saying he is likely to push back a March 1 deadline for imposing new tariffs on the Asia giant as talks continue. The president has long accused the Chinese of engaging in unfair trade practices, and he slapped steep tariffs on China last year, sparking retaliatory steps by the Chinese and spawning fears of a trade war. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a ceasefire in the tariff war last year and began negotiations for a new trade agreement. They set the deadline of March 1, after which new tariffs would go into effect if no agreement is reached. But Trump said Friday he would "not increase the tariffs" as long as progress is being made.

Please read the rules before joining the discussion. President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn’t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs WASHINGTON – From North Korea and China to Fox News hosts and conservative commentator Ann Coulter, President Donald Trump did not stick to the script on Friday when he outlined his plans to declare a national emergency for a wall along the southern U.S. border. The president started his nearly hour-long remarks, all done without the help of a teleprompter, with the latest on trade deals with China. Using one of the biggest moments in his presidency to quickly segue into discussing tariffs, the United Kingdom and North Korea. It wasn't long before he was talking about Fox News host Sean Hannity and other conservative commentators, such as Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. What was missing from Trump's remarks were specifics on what exact actions Trump was taking and planning, where the money would come from and what effect pulling these funds would have on the federal agencies. Here are all the things Trump did discuss in his address about his national emergency that didn't have to do with the construction of a wall along the southern border: As the president walked up to the podium in the Rose Garden at the White House, most thought he would spend his time explaining the reasoning behind his decision to use his executive powers. Instead, Trump started off talking about China. "Before we begin, I'd like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China. We've had a negotiation going on for about two days," the president said. "It's going extremely well. Who knows what that means because it only matters if we get it done but we're very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot." The president trailed off, talking about the history of deals with China and that the U.S. is working toward "leveling the playing field" when it comes to trading with the country. He suggested he might delay a deadline for hiking tariffs on China. President Trump makes the crowd chuckle as he speaks in a singsong manner saying he knows his national emergency declaration is going to lead to a lawsuit, but hopes they'll "get a fair shake." USA TODAY "We're covering everything, all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn't be done, whether it was theft or anything," Trump said. "The unfairness. We've been losing on average $375 billion a year with China." After the president announced he would be signing off on declaring a national emergency, he was asked whether the intense pressure and criticism from conservatives in the news media played into his decision making. "Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do, not of me," Trump said. "If I change my views he wouldn't be with me." Hannity, a Fox News host who has been known to frequently talk to the president on the phone, was one of many Republicans who constantly called for the president to declare a national emergency to get the wall built. Trump then segued into some of the other big names in conservative media. "Rush Limbaugh, I think he's a great guy," Trump said. "He can speak for three hours without a phone call, try doing that sometime. Three hours he speaks. He's got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean this guy is unbelievable." Reporters noticed that instead of answering whether these media personalities played into his decision-making process, he simply boasted about them. Pressed by a reporter, Trump said. "They don't decide policy." Trump stuck on this media tangent, using the moment of his to give shoutouts to how great other Fox News personalities are, such as Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. The president even pointed to coverage he enjoyed on CNN and MSNBC, who he normally rails against as "fake news." He also went into detail about his relationship with conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who as of late has been heavily criticizing him during the negotiations for a border wall. She, also called Trump the "biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States". "Ann Coulter. I don't know her. I hardly know her. I haven't spoken to her in way over a year but the press loves saying Ann Coulter, probably if I did speak to her, she would be very nice," the president said. "I just don't have the time to speak to her. I would speak to her but I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her like right at the beginning, who is going to win the election, she said Donald Trump." He continued, saying that while he does like her "she's off the reservation." "But anybody who knows her understands that. But I haven't spoken to her. I don't follow her. I don't talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name Ann Coulter." Trump went back to his roots during the announcement, using the nationally televised press conference to talk about North Korea, the history of relations between the U.S. and the country and what comes next. He brought up the nickname "Little Rocketman" that he gave North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and boasted about his success in negotiations with the regime, along with how planning is going for his second summit with the leader, which is scheduled this month in Vietnam. Trump faced immediate blowback after asserting that his predecessor, Barack Obama, was on the brink of starting "a big war" with North Korea. The president said Obama told him North Korea's nuclear weapons program presented the greatest threat to the United States during a 2016 meeting in the White House just after Trump won the presidential election. "He told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea," Trump recounted. A number of Obama advisor spoke up and called the claim a complete farce. "It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the Obama administration was considering anything like that," said Michael Fuchs, who served as Obama's deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. He said Trump was simply "lying" about that exchange.

In a televised announcement in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said he would sign the declaration to protect the country from the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants coming across the border from Mexico, which he characterized as a profound threat to national security. “We’re going to confront the national securi... As President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall, he again painted a portrait of a lawless, chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts. Illegal border crossings have been declining for decades. While families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men, a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum, which is legal. Research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And a wall wo... WASHINGTON — President Trump has decided to roll out the big cannon. In the Rose Garden on Friday, he said he was declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico, using money from other federal accounts, after Congress declined to authorize sufficient funds to satisfy him in legislation that averts another government shutdown. Mr. Trump is wielding extraordinary power to get his way. Democrats strenuously dispute that there is a national security crisis on the border that warrants using the kind of presidential authority that in the past has been used for grave matt... WASHINGTON — Outraged House Republicans sued President Barack Obama in 2014 for spending billions of federal dollars without congressional approval — and won. Now many House and Senate Republicans could side with President Trump for doing what they saw as a grave abuse of power by Mr. Obama — circumventing an unwilling Congress in a spending dispute. The power of the purse is paramount for Congress. The constitutional edict that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law” gives Congress the upper hand over the executive branch when it comes t... President Trump reeled off a list of his favorite media personalities on Friday when asked who might have influenced his decision to declare a national emergency after Congress refused to give him money for a border wall. Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — a powerful bloc of conservative voices who have railed against any budget compromise on wall funding — all received shout-outs in a Rose Garden news conference. “Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,” Mr. Trump said of the Fox News commentator. He praised Mr. Limbaugh for his abil... A senior executive from Amazon, one of the world’s biggest companies, found himself last weekend in a showdown with a suburban state senator. The executive, Brian Huseman, was trying to find out whether the New York state senator, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, would keep an obscure state board from blocking Amazon’s ambitious plans to expand in New York City. It was the second phone call in two days between Mr. Huseman and Ms. Stewart-Cousins, who had just risen to power as Democratic majority leader, and once again, she tried to explain to him the politics of Albany. Ms. Stewart-Cousins said in ... WASHINGTON — When Amazon canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City this week, officials more than 200 miles away in Northern Virginia decided to make a statement. Their message: Their region has its act together, they have been far more prepared, and they were free of drama. The comments came from those in the area that has branded itself National Landing, an amalgamation of Arlington and Alexandria neighborhoods that was the other winner in Amazon’s sweepstakes last year to award massive new campuses. But after landing Amazon, National Landing faded from th... Shortly after news broke on Thursday that Amazon was abandoning its plans for a campus in Long Island City, Queens, local elected officials and activist groups who had opposed the deal held a celebratory rally near the site where the company had planned to build its new offices. But along with those cheering the deal’s demise, many hecklers from another faction appeared — those who supported Amazon coming to New York and blamed opponents for torpedoing a deal that would have brought sorely needed jobs and improvements to the community. “Where you gonna get the jobs?” one heckler shouted. [F... The N.F.L. and Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who ignited a protest movement against racism and police brutality by kneeling on the sideline during the playing of the national anthem at games, have settled a case that accused the league of colluding to keep him off a team. The league also settled a similar claim lodged by another player, Eric Reid, who knelt alongside Kaepernick and went unsigned for a period before playing last season for the Carolina Panthers. The statement by the N.F.L. said that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” a... WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation. The court’s move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term. The justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The federal government has long gathered information about citizenship, but since 1950, it has not included a q... For decades, researchers and physicians tended to think about pregnancies as either planned or unplanned. But new data reveals that for a significant group of women, their feelings don’t neatly fit into one category or another. As many as one-fifth of women who become pregnant aren’t sure whether they want a baby. This fact may reshape how doctors and policymakers think about family planning. For women who are unsure, it doesn’t seem enough for physicians to counsel them on pregnancy prevention or prenatal care. “In the past we thought of it as binary, you want to be pregnant or not, so you... (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump declared a national emergency to try and build a border wall that Congress refused to give him. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised announcement at the White House, above. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.” Nearly all of Mr. Trump’s claims about the southern border were misleading, exaggerated or false. Hous... I’m really sorry I didn’t say hi, make eye contact or acknowledge your presence in any way when you waved to me in the hallway the other day. It’s nothing personal. I just have too many people trying to greet me these days, and I can’t respond to everyone. That sounds ridiculous, right? You would never snub a colleague trying to strike up a conversation. Yet when you ignore a personal email, that’s exactly what you’ve done: digital snubbery. Yes, we’re all overwhelmed with email. One recent survey suggested that the average American’s inbox has 199 unread messages. But volume isn’t an excus... The announcement on Thursday that Amazon has canceled its plan to build a headquarters in New York City is no victory. It’s no defeat, either. What it is, to use a Big Apple term, is meh, yet another indication that the dulcet attractions of tech have lost their charm for many and that the business — which has been this country’s most innovative and promising and often its most inspirational — is just that: a business, like any other, out for itself and itself alone, and most definitely not changing the world for the better. That was the cry of tech from its start — especially of the intern... This editorial was updated. With his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, President Trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights. The damage to American democracy threatens to linger long after his administration is no more than a dank memory. Cornered into accepting a budget deal that lacked the $5.7 billion in border-wall funding he demanded, the president could not handle being labeled a loser by conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. His solution: Sign the bill while simultaneously declaring a national emergency that, at least i... MUNICH — If the Munich Security Conference had a soul it was embodied in Senator John McCain, always an invigorating presence here and always a fierce advocate of the trans-Atlantic alliance. He’s gone now and so is the idea of inevitable liberal democratic convergence, replaced by great power competition in the age of the strongman. The meeting comes hard on the heels of a strange gathering in Warsaw — yes, Warsaw — convened by the United States and devoted to “Peace and Security in the Middle East.” It might better have been called “Pipe Dreams on the Vistula” or “Trump’s America Bashes E... You could always slight the very rich by calling them moneybags, robber barons, fat cats or plutocrats. Billionaire was a neutral word, grounded in math: Such a person could spend $10 million a year, for 100 years, before the pile was gone. Then came Howard Schultz, a billionaire times two, insisting that people not use the B-word in describing him. Better to refer to the 540 Americans in his sensitive class as “people of means.” For this he was roundly mocked, and rightly so. The pushback to the pusher of our favorite South American drug is a fair start. But there is much more to clean up.... In opening arguments at the trial of Joaquín Guzmán, known as El Chapo, Assistant United States Attorney Adam Fels told the jury that the shipments seized from Mr. Guzmán’s cartel by American authorities amounted to “more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the United States” — an image that conveys the power of this $14 billion drug boss. The prosecutors were hoping for a long sentence for Mr. Guzmán, one of the most powerful organized-crime figures in the world. On Tuesday, they got it: He was found guilty on 10 charges. He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison. ... President Trump has declared a national emergency — purely in order to fund his wall. The courts may — or may not — reject his gambit. But the fact that he may actually possess the legal authority to require agencies to waste billions of dollars simply to fulfill a foolish campaign promise he thinks won him the election is itself scandalous. The theatrics surrounding his petulant threat to do so obscure a vital question for our democracy going far beyond this (non)crisis, a question to which Congress should immediately turn: Who decides what constitutes a national emergency? In hundreds of ... “You have to be tough to make it in New York City,” Mayor Bill de Blasio boasted, choosing to jeer at Amazon as it canceled its plans on Thursday to build a new headquarters in Queens, after some local officials angrily criticized its proposal. What a strange thing for the mayor to take pride in. It’s certainly true that you have to be tough these days. But that’s because the subways don’t work, the streets are gridlocked, the housing is unaffordable, the shelters are overcrowded, and the schools are segregated and often inadequate. Now think how much tougher it’ll become for the typical ci... Marveling at the mysterious sanctum that his new book explores, the French journalist Frédéric Martel writes that “even in San Francisco’s Castro” there aren’t “quite as many gays.” He’s talking about the Vatican. And he’s delivering a bombshell. Although the book’s publishers have kept it under tight wraps, I obtained a copy in advance of its release next Thursday. It will come out in eight languages and 20 countries, under the title “Sodoma,” as in Sodom, in Western Europe and “In the Closet of the Vatican” in the United States, Britain and Canada. It includes the claim that about 80 perc... Amid the unceasing awfulness of the Trump administration, I’ve lately found comfort in the Yale political scientist Stephen Skowronek’s concept of “political time,” which has in turn informed my thinking about the almost utopian ambitions of the Green New Deal. Surveying the American presidency, Skowronek sees politics unfolding in cycles. Every so often, insurgent coalitions bring an agenda-setting president to power who sweeps away the verities of the old regime, fundamentally restructuring our politics. These “reconstructive presidents,” as Skowronek refers to them, create the political ... U.S. political discussion has been dominated by the issue of Donald Trump’s wall — an issue on which Trump's irrationality keeps surprising even his critics. So I don’t imagine that many people have heard about Trump’s nomination of David Malpass, currently an under secretary at the Treasury Department, to lead the World Bank. But it’s a story worth following. For one thing, while the U.S. traditionally gets to choose the World Bank’s president (Europe gets the International Monetary Fund), there will be a lot of opposition to Malpass, who has a history of being hostile to international ins... Nearly 30 years ago, the United States used its diplomatic clout to persuade Israel and its Arab neighbors to meet publicly for the first time, at the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference, which opened the door to greater Arab acceptance of Israel. On Wednesday and Thursday, leaders of Israel and Arab states met publicly again, at an international conference in Warsaw staged by the Trump administration. But the goal of this meeting, drawing officials of some 60 nations, was not peacemaking. It was to rally support for economic and political war with Iran, for which the United States has found littl... As congressional negotiators wrestled their way toward a compromise bill to fund the federal government this week, one sticking point emerged: the demand by Democrats to sharply reduce the number of beds for immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And while the details are complicated, Democrats claim that the resulting legislation, which President Trump is expected to sign Friday, will bring the number of beds to 40,520, down from 49,057. But while well intentioned — the list of problems with the immigrant detention system is long — if the Democrats gets their way, they... On Feb. 15, 1989, a column of Soviet armored vehicles crossed the Friendship Bridge from Afghanistan into the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. In a theatrical gesture, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, who was overseeing the withdrawal, dismounted and walked the final few feet to Soviet soil. There was not a single Soviet soldier left in Afghanistan, General Gromov told waiting journalists. Since the first troops crossed into Afghanistan in December 1979, the Soviet Union had tried to help the socialist government in Kabul fight off a constellation of insurgents, the most impressive of whom re... WAMBOIN, Australia — This is what climate change looks like, Australia style: A viral video, released in early January, of two middle-aged men, one a local farmer, standing knee deep in the stagnant shallows of an outback river, cradling the corpses of two enormous fish. The river is the Darling, just south of the Menindee Lakes in northwest New South Wales, and the fish are Murray cod, native, iconic and endangered. Given their size, these two could be more than half a century old. Behind the men, who are close to weeping, thousands more fish drift belly-up, asphyxiated in a cold snap that... LONDON — It’s really not funny, but Phoebe Waller-Bridge can’t help it. She is re-enacting this YouTube video of a psychopath sitting dead-eyed in her prison uniform and recounting how she killed a man. When Ms. Waller-Bridge gets to the details — the woman drove a nail through her victim’s skull, strangled him and chopped his body to bits — she laughs, and then she sighs: “Terrible!” Ms. Waller-Bridge, a writer and star of strange and beguiling comedic works, is tucked into a red leather booth in the lobby bar of the Soho Theater, eating a browning banana and searching for little openings ...

But their concert with Ms. Wang was riddled with jokes about her sexual appeal and Chinese heritage that ranged... AURORA, Ill. — A gunman opened fire inside an industrial complex in suburban Chicago on Friday afternoon, injuring several people, including police officers, and resulting in more than one death. Scores of law enforcement authorities swarmed Aurora, Ill., west of Chicago, and schools were forced to keep students inside. After a tense period of waiting, as officers from departments all over the region gathered near the complex, the Aurora Police Department said the gunman had been taken into custody. By late afternoon, the Kane County Coroner’s Office said that more than one person had died ... New Jersey’s attorney general has stepped into the investigation of President Trump’s $107 million presidential inaugural fund, issuing an administrative subpoena for the fund’s financial records, including any that document fund-raising in the state. The action, taken last week by the state’s consumer protection office, came on the heels of a subpoena issued this month by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Federal investigators are examining whether all donations to the fund were reported, as required, and whether any foreigners illegally contributed money using Americans as straw donors. T... SAN FRANCISCO — Technology companies rarely make money before they go public. Twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market. So were Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey. For Uber, the question as the ride-hailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money.

---split---23.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html---split---Supported by By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Trump declared a national emergency at the border on Friday to access billions of dollars to build a border wall that Congress refused to give him, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a fundamental confrontation over separation of powers. In a televised announcement in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said he would sign the declaration to protect the country from the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants coming across the border from Mexico, which he characterized as a profound threat to national security. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.” But as he sought to deny that he was taking action because he could not persuade Congress to give him the money, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation required urgent unilateral action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it faster,” he said. “I want to get it done faster, that’s all.” The announcement came during a freewheeling appearance in which Mr. Trump ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader. He again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize and reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not. Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump refused to accept that he lost his two-month drive to press Congress to give him the border wall money he demanded even as he criticized former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, without naming him, for failing to provide the funding when Republicans controlled the House. Mr. Trump’s speech and answers to questions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative. “The numbers you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.” On point after point, he insisted that he would be proved correct and his doubters proved wrong. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Kim Jong-un of North Korea, “and you know what? It ended up being a very good relationship.” The border emergency declaration, which Mr. Trump signed later in the day, enables Mr. Trump to divert $3.6 billion budgeted for military construction projects to the border wall, White House officials said. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential budgetary discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. Combined with the $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in a spending package passed by Congress on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would then have about $8 billion in all to advance construction of new barriers and repairs or replacement of existing barriers along the border this year, significantly more than the $5.7 billion that Congress refused to give him. The president’s decision, previewed on Thursday, incited instant condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a joint statement. The two vowed to try to overturn the decision, appealing to Republicans to join them. “The president is not above the law,” they said. “The Congress cannot let the president shred the Constitution.” House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block the president’s move, which could pass both houses if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who had criticized the planned declaration. That would put the president in the position of issuing the first veto of his presidency. [President Trump declared a national emergency. What happens now?] In addition to a legislative effort to stop Mr. Trump, the issue will almost certainly be taken to court, either by congressional Democrats, liberal advocacy groups or both. Legal experts have said the administration can make serious arguments to justify its move, but added that courts may decide that it is stretching the intent of the law. The Supreme Court is controlled by a five-member conservative bloc but in recent years has reined in Republican and Democratic presidents who were judged to be exceeding their authority. White House officials rejected critics who said Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress. “It actually creates zero precedent,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters on Friday morning. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he didn’t get what he wanted and waved a magic wand to get some money.” Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times and 31 of those emergencies remain active, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization. White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf War and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda’s assault on America — and were moving military money around to use for military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress. In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though illegal crossings have actually fallen in recent years. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular process. [Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.] The spending package passed by Congress on Thursday after a two-month showdown with the president included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump agreed to sign the package into law anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay. White House officials said Mr. Trump signed that spending package later on Friday. Mr. Trump plans to leave Washington on Friday afternoon for a long holiday weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall. Mr. McConnell privately told the president he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration. Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for what they saw as overstepping his executive authority after failing to win policy fights with Congress. “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,” Mr. Trump wrote in 2014.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption President Trump delivers remarks about border security in the Rose Garden at the White House on Friday. Updated at 6:15 p.m. ET Calling it "a great thing to do," President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in order to help finance a long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. It's a highly unusual move from an unconventional president. In circuitous remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump said he was declaring an emergency because of "an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs." The move came a day after Congress approved a spending bill giving Trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, far short of the $5.7 billion he had called for. Trump signed the bill Friday afternoon, averting another government shutdown until at least October. Invoking emergency powers frees up additional funding. Legal challenges and pushback even from some within his own party await Trump in the next phase of the ongoing national political battle over border security and immigration policy — cementing the issues at the forefront of his bid for a second term. The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday evening that it is launching an "immediate investigation" into Trump's decision to declare the national emergency. The committee is requesting that those involved in the declaration, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, testify on Capitol Hill. Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and six other House Democrats who chair subcommittees of the judiciary panel, signed the letter to the president, writing that "we believe your declaration of an emergency shows a reckless disregard for the separation of powers and your own responsibilities under our constitutional system." Opponents of the declaration say Trump's claim of a crisis at the border is overblown and that the move is unnecessary. Illegal border crossings in the most recent fiscal year (ending in September 2018) were actually lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and much lower than at their peak around 2000, as NPR has previously fact-checked. Many of the most recent arrivals are Central American migrants seeking asylum, citing a fear of violence or persecution back home. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a statement sharply critical of the president's action. The statement said, in part: "The President's unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation. ... "The President's actions clearly violate the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available." White House officials say Trump's executive action, including the emergency declaration, will free up about $8 billion for border wall construction. That includes the $1.375 billion in the funding bill passed by Congress on Thursday. The balance of the funds include: No disaster money will be used as part of this plan. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee, called the reallocation of funds "utterly disrespectful of U.S. national security and the needs of our men and women in uniform, and it further undermines his credibility in requesting the upcoming defense budget." White House officials say the $8 billion should allow Trump to build as much wall as he wanted to — 234 miles of barrier — had Congress authorized the $5.7 billion he asked for. Officials say plans are to construct a metal bollard barrier, not a concrete wall, at locations to be determined by Customs and Border Protection. Trump said Friday that he expects such legal challenges and predicted they would eventually reach the Supreme Court, where, he said, "We'll win, I think." "I didn't need to do this," Trump said in response to a reporter's question about the emergency declaration. "I just want to get it done faster, that's all." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had previously cautioned Trump against declaring a national emergency, said Thursday he was on board with the president's move. However, others within the GOP have pushed back. Centrist Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for re-election in 2020, called Trump's planned move a "mistake" in a statement Thursday. Collins also argued that the National Emergencies Act was only "intended to apply to major natural disasters or catastrophic events, such as the attacks on our country." "Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process; it's just not good policy. It also sets a bad precedent for future presidents — both Democratic and Republican — who might seek to use this same maneuver to circumvent Congress to advance their policy goals. It is also of dubious constitutionality, and it will almost certainly be challenged in the courts," Collins said. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, whose districts covers about 800 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, said Friday on The View that the declaration was "unnecessary" and expressed concerns about the land seizures that would have to take place in order to build the wall. "What we should be talking about is the strategy on how to defend our border, not one specific tool, which is the wall," Hurd said. But to Trump, declaring a national emergency likely seems to be the only way he can claim victory after weeks of back-and-forth over funding for border security that included a record 35-day partial government shutdown.

John Cornyn (on the left of him) and Ted Cruz (on the right) near the Rio Grande in McAllen, Texas, on Jan. 10. Another shutdown would have been risky, and there wasn't much appetite for going that route again among congressional Republicans. But there's little support among the public for Trump's approach either. A CNN poll earlier this month showed Americans oppose — by more than 2 to 1 — Trump using a national emergency declaration to build a border wall. That seems to be one of the messages Democratic leaders will home in on during what is likely to be a new phase in the standoff over border security. In the Democrats' Spanish-language response to Trump's State of the Union earlier this month, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he would sue the administration if Trump declared a national emergency to find funds for a border wall. On Friday, appearing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Becerra said a lawsuit would likely be coming soon. "This is not 9/11. This is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979," Becerra said, citing past presidential emergency declarations. "This is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our U.S. Constitution."

---split---24.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-will-declare-national-emergency-at-border-but-legal-fight-expected---split---President Donald Trump, here addressing reporters on Jan. 10, will sign a government shutdown-avoiding bill and declare a national emergency at the border to access Pentagon funds for his proposed southern border barrier. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images file photo) President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border to redirect military funds to his border wall project after lawmakers gave him $4.3 billion less than his $5.7 billion ask. But the move is expected to bring court fights that could sink his plan. A House-Senate conference committee could only agree to give the president just shy of $1.4 billion for the barrier project as conferees struck a deal needed to avert another partial government shutdown. The president — who earlier this week said he couldn’t say he was happy about the contents of the compromise — reluctantly agreed to sign it into law after the Senate and House sign off during floor votes Thursday. [Why 19 Democrats and 109 Republicans voted against the government funding deal] The White House confirmed Trump would sign the compromise spending measure — and avert another government shutdown after the recent 35-day one left him politically damaged — but then declare a national emergency. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.” Lawmakers in both parties who desperately want to keep the government open breathed a sigh of relief at the former. But Democrats will have to hold their noses as most of them vote for the spending measure, knowing the president will subsequently take an action over which they long have threatened legal action. [Trump’s cryptic ‘funding bill’ tweet momentarily casts doubt over border bill] Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday afternoon she “may” file a legal challenge to Trump’s national emergency declaration, adding that she didn’t support “any president doing an end-run around Congress.” In a statement issued after her press conference, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer were more explicit in threatening a legal fight. “The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities,” the duo said. Trump’s top spokeswoman, however, brushed off the threat. “We are very prepared, but there shouldn’t be. The president is doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” Sanders told reporters outside her office Thursday. Watch: Senate leaders interrupt Grassley speech to announce Trump’s support for deal, national emergency plans Democratic and Republican lawmakers in recent days, echoed by legal scholars, had already been predicting that a “national emergency” move would be met by swift legal action. Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy organization, said in a statement Thursday that it would sue Trump if he takes that action. “If this invocation of emergency on false pretenses is tolerated, it could justify almost limitless abuses of presidential and military power, including far-reaching clampdowns on civil rights,” the group said. Mark Rom, a Georgetown University professor, said that should the matter get to the U.S. Supreme Court, he wouldn’t expect the justices to “challenge the president’s ability to declare a national emergency.” “Now, on the question of whether the president’s claim that an emergency allows him to move the money around, it’s anyone’s guess just where the court might come down,” Rom said. “My expectation is this will play out like Trump’s initial travel ban: He will keep tinkering and keep tinkering until the courts decide it’s just within legal boundaries.” Trump’s power to declare the emergency stems from the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which “makes no attempt to dictate conditions for when this can be done, according to Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Thus, if Trump wishes to state that the border is in such a state of disarray or exposure that it constitutes a national emergency under the NEA, he is mostly free to do so. [White House: Wall funds would be ‘back-filled’ in 2020 budget request] “Trump presumably would assert that the border wall is a military fortification of sorts, and that it is key to supporting the military role in providing border security. And so the argument would turn on whether one accepts the predicate about the military’s role in the first instance,” Chesney said. “On one hand, it’s obvious that, in some contexts like an armed invasion, border control can be a military matter of the first order,” he said. “On the other hand, that is not the situation we currently face … and not the way we largely have handled the southern border.” Watch: What is a national emergency? How Congress gave the White House broad, far-reaching powers Gordon Adams, who oversaw defense and national security budgeting for the Clinton White House, agreed that Trump has the legal authority to make the declaration. It is not a settled legal matter that four congressional panels — two now controlled by Democrats — would have to sign off on using Pentagon dollars for the Department of Homeland Security border wall program under a national emergency The funds likely would be drawn from the Pentagon’s “military construction,” or MILCON, budget, Adams said. “There are usually $5 billion to $10 billion of unobligated MILCON funds every year, so the money will be there,” he said. “Now, that will mean the secretaries of the [armed] services won’t be able to upgrade barracks or do other projects on bases, but there’s no sign the president gives a damn or would prioritize that over the wall.” [Spending deal would kill Donald Trump’s federal pay freeze] What’s more, the declaration is a signal White House officials have decided they do not need the approval of the congressional committees to shift the funds around. “There’s no actual statutory requirement for that,” Adams said. “A lot of the ways government does business in this town is based on customs. This administration has found every loophole to those customs.” But Democratic leaders are warning their GOP colleagues to oppose the emergency move. “The precedent that the president is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans,” Pelosi said. That’s because a Democratic president could declare, for instance, the gun violence epidemic a national emergency to their chagrin, she noted. Some Republicans also warned of the Pandora’s box Trump may be opening. “If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?” Washington GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers said, noting that she opposes the Trump’s decision. The compromise spending bill’s $1.375 billion border fencing amount led Trump to, after weeks of threatening it, revert to the national emergency option after promising his conservative base for years that he would build a wall — later termed a “barrier” - along the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to slow the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country. [Trump defends signing national emergency to build border wall] “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway,” he told a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday. The next day, he signaled to reporters his administration was working on a way to shift funds around to get more into the border project’s coffers, saying: “I’m thrilled because we’re supplementing things and moving things around and we’re doing things that are fantastic, taking from far less important areas, and the bottom line is we’re building a lot of wall.” The president has repeatedly warned of a “crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border to justify his move, repeating his hard-line rhetoric that the area is a transit route for lethal narcotics, hordes of migrants making illegal crossings, dangerous criminals and human traffickers. On the legal front, any upcoming lawsuits might include congressional Democrats — just one of many potential legal arenas in which they and Trump could tussle over the next two years. Senate Judiciary member Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, predicted “a significant and likely successful challenge in court.” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer signaled a similar sentiment on Jan. 8. [Trump field tests 2020 campaign attack lines amid latest shutdown drama] But as another shutdown neared, many GOP lawmakers who previously had concerns about an emergency declaration changed their tunes. They said the conference committee proposed too little for border barrier dollars, giving Trump no choice but to seek the Pentagon monies. As the expected legal challenges play out, Rom, the Georgetown professor, suggested both sides can claim wins. “[Trump] can declare victory, no matter what happens in the courts. The president can now say to his supporters that he has solved the problem, and that he had no other choice. He can say, ‘I’ve done all I can do,’” Rom said. “Democrats can tell their supporters they stood strong and forced the president’s hand.” But Pelosi indicated Democrats will be methodical, saying of a legal challenge: “First, we have to see what the president says.” To that end, White House aides Thursday afternoon had only begun mulling how Trump might sign the spending measure and the emergency order. In late January, when he announced he would support a stopgap measure to end the partial government shutdown, he took advantage of an unseasonably warm Washington winter day with an early afternoon Rose Garden event.

---split---24.0---split---http://www.people-press.org/2019/01/18/trump-begins-third-year-with-low-job-approval-and-doubts-about-his-honesty/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  U.S. Politics & Policy Views of economy remain positive, divided by partisanship At the second anniversary of his inauguration, public views of Donald Trump’s job performance, as well as his honesty and administration’s ethics, are decidedly negative. Yet opinions about the nation’s economy continue to be positive – and Trump’s handling of the economy remains a relative strength. Trump begins his third year with a 37% job approval rating; 59% disapprove of his job performance. Of five previous presidents, only Ronald Reagan had as low a job approval mark at this point in his presidency. (Reagan’s disapproval – 54% – was lower than Trump’s.) The new Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,505 adults, finds that a growing share of Americans say they trust what Trump says less than what previous presidents said while they were in office. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) say they trust what Trump says less than previous presidents, up from 54% last June and 51% in February 2017, shortly after he took office. The public also continues to fault the ethical standards of top administration officials. Just 39% rate their ethical standards as excellent or good, while 59% say they are not good or poor. While these opinions are little changed from last year, they are lower than evaluations of ethics of top officials for presidents dating back to Reagan. However, more Americans say Trump’s economic policies have made conditions better (40%) than worse (28%), while 29% say they have not had much of an effect. In January 2011, a comparable point in Barack Obama’s presidency, the public expressed mixed views of the impact of his economic policies, with about as many saying his policies made things worse (31%) as better (28%). And Trump engenders more confidence for his ability to make good decisions on trade and the economy than in other areas, especially working with Congress. About half say they are very or somewhat confident in Trump’s ability to negotiate favorable trade deals (51%) and make good decisions about economic policy (49%). By contrast, 40% have confidence in Trump on immigration policy and 35% are confident he can work effectively with Congress. (For more on views of Trump’s handling of the government shutdown, see “Most Border Wall Opponents, Supporters Say Shutdown Concessions Are Unacceptable.”) Trump’s presidency has been characterized by a favorable economic climate and that remains the case today. Currently, 51% say economic conditions are either excellent or good – among the highest ratings in nearly two decades. The surge in positive economic views has been driven by Republicans. Three-quarters of Republicans rate the economy as excellent or good, up from just 14% in December 2016, at the end of Obama’s presidency. By contrast, just 32% of Democrats offer positive ratings; Democrats are now less likely to rate the economy as either excellent or good than they were in December of 2016 (46%). The public’s perceptions of the availability of jobs have undergone a similar transformation. For the first time in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2001, a clear majority of Americans (60%) say there are plenty of jobs in their communities. And while these perceptions also are divided along partisan lines, majorities of Republicans (71%) and Democrats (53%) say there are plenty of jobs available locally. Yet favorable opinions about the economy and jobs have not been accompanied by a rise in public satisfaction with national conditions. For longer than a decade, no more than about a third of Americans have expressed with the way things are going in the country. Today, that figure stands at just 26%, down from 33% in September, with the decline coming among members of both parties. Among the survey’s other major findings: Low expectations for Trump’s legacy. About half (47%) think Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, compared with fewer (29%) who think he will be a successful president; 23% say it’s too early to tell. Ratings for Trump are more negative, on balance, than for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their administrations; in February 1995, more said Bill Clinton would be unsuccessful (34%) than successful (18%). Compared with his three most recent predecessors, far fewer say it is “too early to tell” whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful. Most Democrats want party leaders to “stand up” to Trump. As was the case a year ago, a majority of Democrats (70%) want their party’s leaders to “stand up” to Trump this year, even if it means less gets done in Washington; just 26% want them to try as best they can to work with Trump, even if it means disappointing some groups of Democratic supporters. A year ago, 63% of Democrats wanted their party’s leaders to stand up to the president. Among Republicans, the share saying Trump should stand up to Democrats has increased from 40% a year ago to 51% currently. Majority continues to say Trump has responsibility to release tax returns. As in the past, a majority (64%) says Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns; just 32% say he does not have a responsibility to do this. Nearly all Democrats (91%) – and 32% of Republicans – say Trump should release his tax returns. Public confidence in Mueller investigation steady. A majority (55%) remains confident that special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a fair investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. Confidence in Mueller has held steady over the course of the past year, and there remains more confidence in Mueller to conduct a fair investigation than in Trump to handle matters related to the inquiry appropriately.

California is likely to sue President Donald Trump over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the state attorney general said Friday. (Feb. 15) AP WASHINGTON – Soon after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border, a number of lawsuits were announced that would challenge the order. The national emergency and other measures will free up $8 billion – far more than the $5.7 billion he initially demanded – to free up funding for 234 miles of bollard wall, the White House said. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union, the state of California and a number of political groups announced plans to file lawsuits challenging Trump, something the president said he was prepared for. Trump said he expects the legal battle to make its way through the courts and end up at the Supreme Court, where he said he hopes his administration will get a "fair shake." The ACLU said on Friday that it planned to file a lawsuit early next week challenging Trump's use of his executive powers to go around Congress. The organization, which has challenged the Trump administration on many legal fronts over the last two years, argued Trump's order violates the Consitution. The organization said no other president has attempted to use emergency powers to fund a project and pointed to remarks Trump made from the White House in announcing the order, where he said of his emergency declaration: "I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster." President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn’t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs More: Read President Trump's national emergency order to fund a border wall More: 'I use many stats.' Trump spars with reporter over why he declared a national emergency at the border More: Democrats vow to fight Trump's national emergency plans "By the president’s very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency. He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress, and decided to move along his promise for a border wall ‘faster,'" ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. "This is a patently illegal power grab that hurts American communities and flouts the checks and balances that are hallmarks of our democracy." Two separate lawsuits were also planned from the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen and the Center for Biological Diversity. Public Citizen said it would argue Trump lacks the authority to declare an emergency when "there's no emergency," Allison Zieve, director of litigation for the organization, said to USA TODAY. The Center for Biological Diversity said they also would focus on its constitutionality and argued against the wall due to its effects a wall has on the environment and animals. "The Center will defend the borderlands and fight Trump’s illegal action in court," said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. "He’s destroying wildlife and communities along the border and assaulting democracy in the process. Trump is not above the law.” In California, the governor and attorney general – both Democrats – held a news conference in Sacramento also vowing to file a lawsuit to block Trump. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he’s been trying to work with federal agencies to combat the growing threat of drugs crossing into California. But he said a border wall is not the solution since most of those drugs enter through ports of entry and construction of a wall would take away funding from the very law enforcement agencies that have been successfully working to combat drug trafficking. President Trump makes the crowd chuckle as he speaks in a singsong manner saying he knows his national emergency declaration is going to lead to a lawsuit, but hopes they'll "get a fair shake." USA TODAY Newsom called Trump’s wall a “vanity project,” a “monument to stupidity” and a blatant political ploy that he engineered after being “embarrassed” by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the recent government shutdown. “I don’t want to be a sparring partner with President Trump, we want to be a working partner, but he makes it all but impossible when he plays these games and manufactures a crisis and creates the conditions where we have no other choice but to sue the administration,” Newsom said. “Donald Trump, we’ll see you in court.” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he’s coordinating with other attorneys general around the country to read through the emergency declaration and prepare a federal lawsuit. He said the president has not presented a convincing case that the southern border represents a crisis because border crossings are at historic lows. More: Follow the money: How President Trump's national emergency will pay for a border wall More: Donald Trump declares national emergency to free up billions of dollars for border wall “He has the power to declare a national emergency, but this is not 9-11, this is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979,” Becerra said. “This is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our U.S. Constitution.” Because of that, Becerra said Trump is clearly exceeding his constitutional authority by ignoring the appropriations made by Congress and diverting funds to his border wall. He also pointed to Trump's comments during his news conference at the White House Friday morning. “President Trump got one thing right this morning about his declaration when he said, ‘I didn’t have to do this.’ He’s right, he didn’t have to do this. In fact, he can’t do this because the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to direct dollars,” Becerra said. On Thursday, before Trump even laid out the details of his order, Protect Democracy and the Niskanen Center said they were already preparing lawsuits to challenge the president's emergency order. The groups said they would represent El Paso County in Texas along with the Border Network for Human Rights in a lawsuit against the administration. Contributing: John Fritze, David Jackson

---split---33.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/#interactive---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Most still want U.S. as top global power, but see China on the rise By Richard Wike, Bruce Stokes, Jacob Poushter, Laura Silver, Janell Fetterolf and Kat Devlin America’s global image plummeted following the election of President Donald Trump, amid widespread opposition to his administration’s policies and a widely shared lack of confidence in his leadership. Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election approaches, a new 25-nation Pew Research Center survey finds that Trump’s international image remains poor, while ratings for the United States are much lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency. The poll also finds that international publics express significant concerns about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it used to. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well, including the fact that, while the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago. Even though America’s image has declined since Trump’s election, on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% offer an unfavorable rating. However, a median of only 27% say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs; 70% lack confidence in him. Frustrations with the U.S. in the Trump era are particularly common among some of America’s closest allies and partners. In Germany, where just 10% have confidence in Trump, three-in-four people say the U.S. is doing less these days to address global problems, and the share of the public who believe the U.S. respects personal freedoms is down 35 percentage points since 2008. In France, only 9% have confidence in Trump, while 81% think the U.S. doesn’t consider the interests of countries like France when making foreign policy decisions. Critical views are also widespread among America’s closest neighbors. Only 25% of Canadians rate Trump positively, more than six-in-ten (63%) say the U.S. is doing less than in the past to address global problems, and 82% think the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making policy. Meanwhile, Trump’s lowest ratings on the survey are found in Mexico, where just 6% express confidence in his leadership. One exception to this pattern is Israel. After a year in which the Trump administration generated international controversy by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, his positive rating jumped to 69%, up from 56% in 2017. Around the world, publics are divided about the direction of American power: Across the 25 nations surveyed, a median of 31% say the U.S. plays a more important role in the world today than it did ten years ago; 25% say it plays a less important role; and 35% believe the U.S. is as important as it was a decade ago. In contrast, views about Chinese power are clear: A median of 70% say China’s role on the world stage has grown over the past 10 years. Still, by a slim margin, more people name the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power (a median of 39% say the U.S., 34% say China). And despite the unease many feel about the U.S. at the moment, the idea of a U.S.-led world order is still attractive to most. When asked which would be better for the world, having China or the U.S. as the top global power, people in nearly every country tend to select the U.S., and this is particularly common among some of China’s Asia-Pacific neighbors, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Australia. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to Aug. 12, 2018. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 use additional data from a Pew Research Center survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted from May 14 to June 15, 2018. Although perceptions of the U.S. are on balance positive, they vary considerably among the nations surveyed. Ten of the 25 countries in this year’s survey are European Union member states, and across these EU nations a median of just 43% offer a favorable opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, half or more in four of the five Asia-Pacific nations polled give the U.S. a positive rating, including 83% in the Philippines, one of the highest ratings in the survey. The U.S. also gets high marks in South Korea, where 80% have a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in President Trump has increased over the past year from 17% to 44%. As has largely been the case since Pew Research Center’s first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, attitudes toward the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa are largely positive, with Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans expressing mostly favorable opinions in this year’s poll. The three Latin American nations polled offer differing views about the U.S., with Brazilians voicing mostly favorable reviews, while Argentines and Mexicans are mostly negative. And the two Middle Eastern nations in the study – Israel and Tunisia – offer strikingly different assessments. The country giving the U.S. its lowest rating in the survey, and the place where the biggest drop in U.S. favorability has taken place over the past year, is Russia. Just 26% of Russians have a favorable opinion of the U.S., compared with 41% in 2017. A 55% majority of Russians say relations have gotten worse in the past year, and the share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53% to 19%. The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders, and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five. A median of 70% across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews. In contrast, opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive. Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU, although there are regional divides within Europe, with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe. European attitudes toward Trump are strikingly negative, especially when compared with the ratings his predecessor received while in office. Looking at four European nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently since 2003 reveals a clear pattern regarding perceptions of American presidents. George W. Bush, whose foreign policies were broadly unpopular in Europe, got low ratings during his presidency, while the opposite was true for Barack Obama, who enjoyed strong approval in these four nations during his time in office. Following the 2016 election, confidence in the president plunged, with Trump’s ratings resembling what Bush received near the end of his second term (although Trump’s numbers are up slightly in the United Kingdom this year). In several European nations, Trump receives higher ratings from supporters of right-wing populist parties. For example, among people in the UK who have a favorable view of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), 53% express confidence in Trump, compared with only 21% among those with an unfavorable view of UKIP. Similar divides exist among supporters and detractors of right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. However, it is worth noting that, other than in the UK, there is no European country in which more than half of right-wing populist party supporters say they have confidence in Trump. A common criticism about American foreign policy over the past decade and a half has been that the U.S. only looks after its own interests in world affairs, ignoring the interests of other nations. As Pew Research Center surveys showed, this belief was especially prevalent during George W. Bush’s presidency, when many around the world thought the U.S. was pursuing unilateralist, and unpopular, policies. Strong opposition to the Iraq War and other elements of Bush’s foreign policy led to rising complaints about the U.S. acting alone and ignoring the interests and concerns of other nations. Opinions shifted following Barack Obama’s election, with more people saying the U.S. considers their country’s interest, although even during the Obama years the prevailing global sentiment was that the U.S. doesn’t necessarily consider other countries. Now, the Trump presidency has brought an increase in the number of people in many nations saying the U.S. essentially doesn’t listen to countries like theirs when making foreign policy. This pattern is especially pronounced among some of America’s top allies and partners. For instance, while the share of the French public who believe the U.S. considers their national interest has not been very high at any point over the past decade and a half, it reached a low point near the end of Bush’s second term (11% in 2007), rose somewhat during Obama’s presidency (35% in 2013) and has declined once more under Trump. Today, just 18% in France say the U.S. considers the interests of countries like theirs when making policy. America’s reputation as a defender of individual liberty has generally been strong in Pew Research Center surveys since we first started asking about it in 2008. The prevailing view among the publics surveyed has typically been that the U.S. government respects the personal liberties of its people, and that is true again in this year’s poll. However, this opinion has become less common over time, and the decline has been particularly sharp among key U.S. partners in Europe, North America and Asia. The decline began during the Obama administration following revelations about the National Security Agency’s electronic eavesdropping on communications around the world, and it has continued during the first two years of the Trump presidency. The drop is especially prominent in Western Europe, where the share of the public saying Washington respects personal freedom has declined sharply since 2013. The same pattern is found among several other U.S. allies as well, including Canada, where the percentage saying the U.S. respects individual freedom has dropped from 75% to 38% since 2013, and Australia, where it has gone from 72% to 45%. Respondents to the survey were read a list of seven major nations, and for each one, were asked whether they think it is playing a more important, less important, or as important of a role in the world compared with 10 years ago. Among the seven countries tested, China stands apart: A median of 70% across the nations polled say Beijing plays a more important role today than a decade ago. Half or more in 23 of 25 countries express this view. Many also say this about Russia. A median of 42% believe Moscow’s role on the world stage has grown over the past decade, and majorities hold this view in Greece, Israel, Tunisia and Russia itself. Overall, people are split on whether Germany’s role is greater than it was 10 years ago or about the same, but many in Europe see Germany’s role as more influential. On the other hand, Europeans are particularly likely to think the UK is less important now. There is no real consensus in views of America’s prominence in world affairs. A median of 35% believe it is as important as it was 10 years ago, while 31% say it is more important and 25% say less. Japan is the only country with a majority saying that Washington plays a less important role. Meanwhile, Israelis, Nigerians and Kenyans are particularly likely to think the U.S. is more important than it used to be. In addition to being asked about whether major powers are rising, falling or staying about the same, respondents were asked the following question about whether they would prefer the U.S. or China to be the top global power: “Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world: the U.S. is the world’s leading power or China is the world’s leading power?” Results show that the U.S. is overwhelmingly the top choice. The U.S. is named more often than China in every country surveyed except three: Argentina, Tunisia and Russia, although in many nations significant numbers volunteer that it would be good for the world if both or neither were the leading power. Some of America’s allies in Asia and elsewhere are particularly likely to prefer a future in which the U.S. is the top global power. Two-thirds or more hold this opinion in Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK.  Findings from Germany, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Israel illustrate key patterns and major differences in how foreign publics view the U.S. in 2018. Germany stands out as a country where America’s image is considerably more negative today than during the Barack Obama era. Whereas Obama was extremely popular in Germany (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA scandal), only around one-in-ten Germans have voiced confidence in Trump in each of the past two years, ratings similar to those registered for George W. Bush at the end of his second term. Germany stands out on other measures as well. It is the country with the highest percentage (80%) saying relations with the U.S. have deteriorated over the past year, and it is tied with Sweden for the largest share of the public (75%) saying the U.S. is doing less to confront global problems. Germany is also where the biggest declines have taken place in recent years regarding the belief that the U.S. respects personal freedom and that Washington listens to other countries in international affairs. Mexico is where Trump gets his lowest ratings on the survey: Just 6% in the United States’ southern neighbor have confidence in him. Last year, more than nine-in-ten Mexicans opposed Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year, 66% in Mexico say relations have gotten worse over the past 12 months. Just 39% of Canadians express a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2018, the lowest percentage since Pew Research Center began polling in Canada in 2002. Only 25% have confidence in Trump, although he gets more positive ratings among those who feel closest to the Conservative Party (44%) than among those who identify with the New Democratic Party (17%) or the ruling Liberal Party (10%). Fully 82% say the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making foreign policy. Japanese trust in the U.S. president has also suffered under Donald Trump, but America’s overall image has not. In 2018, just three-in-ten Japanese say they have confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs, a slight improvement over their view in 2017, but significantly lower than their views of the U.S. president throughout the Obama administration. Opinion of Trump is comparable to sentiment about George W. Bush during his time in office. Fully 67% of Japanese, however, have a favorable view of the U.S., up 10 percentage points from last year. Despite the high ratings for the U.S., there are concerns in Japan about the trajectory of American power – it is the only country where a majority (55%) believes the U.S. is less powerful than 10 years ago. Confidence in President Trump has increased significantly in Israel since 2017. Trump also receives substantially higher ratings than Obama got near the end of his second term, although they are very similar to the high ratings for Obama in 2014, before tensions rose between his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. As has been the case in recent years, around eight-in-ten Israelis express a favorable opinion about the U.S. At 52%, Israelis are more likely than any other public surveyed to say the U.S. is doing more to address global problems than a few years ago. Israel also tops the list in terms of the share of the public (79%) saying that relations with the U.S. have improved in the past year. The rest of the report delves into these and other findings in more detail. Chapter 1 explores overall attitudes toward the U.S., America’s approach to foreign policy, whether the U.S. government respects individual liberty, and relations between survey countries and the U.S. Chapter 2 examines ratings for President Trump and other world leaders. Chapter 3 looks at opinions regarding whether specific major nations are playing a more or less important role in world affairs than in the past. Chapter 4 explores views about the balance of power between the U.S. and China, while Chapter 5 examines China’s global image.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.
