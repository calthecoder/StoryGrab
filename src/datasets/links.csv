---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/first-gentleman-female-president-husbands_n_5c7848cde4b087c2f2948533---split---In 2020, America might finally elect its first female commander in chief. And with her could come the nation’s first first gentleman. In an already crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge President Donald Trump, several women are among the leading candidates: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ― each of whom would bring along a husband to run the East Wing of the White House. When it comes to the role of first spouse ― or first lady until now ― there are no legal parameters, according to experts. But there are still certain expectations of the activities those in that role have taken on ― and much of these have fallen along traditional gender lines. “The primary role is social hostess: decorating the White House, holding events when foreign diplomats are here, giving tours,” said Jean Wahl Harris, a political science professor at the University of Scranton, who has studied the role of the first lady for nearly two decades. “Many of the expectations are very gendered, not things we would expect men to do, like hostessing ― but I think the expectations for the [male] spouse are not going to be the same.” First ladies in the past have orchestrated official events, working with the White House social secretary, chefs and florists to do so. As White House custodian, each first lady has also chosen a set of china and rearranged the interior decor. They’re expected to travel abroad to represent the presidency to foreign governments, and at home, to choose a cause ― usually something noncontroversial, such as nutrition and exercise in Michelle Obama’s case. “That will be the change: If they [first gentlemen] choose to keep their career,” said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush from 2005 to 2009 and now directs programming on the legacies of America’s first ladies at the Center for Presidential Studies at American University. Until now, no first lady has kept her job once her husband reached the White House ― even when that meant leaving behind a hard-built career, like Obama who left a leadership position at the University of Chicago medical center to enter the White House. Any future first gentleman keeping their job would mean juggling work with first spouse duties, and could also pose a challenge to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with their private sector work. HuffPost reached out to Harris, Gillibrand and Warren’s campaigns, who did not comment for this story. Another question is whether the first gentleman would bear the same intense scrutiny by the public and media, particularly of their fashion choices, as first ladies always have. “That will be the most interesting thing,” McBride said. “That conversation will go away for the [male] spouse, but I bet it will not go away for the [female] president,” she guessed. Exactly how America’s first male presidential spouse may adapt to the role remains to be seen. “It has been a very gendered role, so will having a ‘first man’ really change the expectations?” Harris wondered. “We may not expect as much from him ... but I hope I’m wrong.” Here’s what you need to know about some of the men who may become America’s first first gentleman. A post shared by Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Feb 11, 2019 at 5:09pm PST His job: Mann, 68, is a law professor at Harvard Law School, teaching American legal history and property, according to his bio on Harvard’s website. This spring semester, he is teaching a legal U.S. history course covering 18th to 19th century America, including the impact of the American Revolution on the law and crime and changing legal definitions of slavery and freedom. Where he lives: Mann and Warren live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with their golden retriever Bailey ― whom Mann convinced Warren to get last summer, saying, “The heart wants what the heart wants.” Where he grew up: Mann is from Massachusetts. How he and the senator first met: Mann and Warren met in the late 1970s at a law conference in Florida, the Boston Globe reported. At the time, Warren was a single mom with two kids who had divorced from her first husband. After she proposed to Mann in a classroom after seeing him teach, they got hitched in July 1980, and have been married for nearly 39 years. How he’s supported his wife in her political career: Warren has called Mann her “best friend, biggest supporter” and love of her life. Early on, he supported Warren’s career as a professor, giving up a job in Connecticut to move in with her and her kids in Houston, Texas, and later commuting from Philadelphia to their home in Cambridge on weekends, when Warren got tenure at Harvard before he did. “He did it all,” Warren told the Globe. “Bruce flew back and forth and back and forth.” Since Warren’s been a senator, Mann has become a fixture in her Instagram, and lately he’s been on the campaign trail or sending her cute pics of their dog Bailey when she’s off stumping without him. Fun fact: Warren calls Mann her “sweetie.” Best guess at the cause he’d choose as first gentleman: As a decades-long professor, Mann could become a champion for U.S. education and improving access to higher education. Most likely domestic household initiative he’ll take on: As someone who offered his wife a newly installed and organized hallway closet for their anniversary, Mann would likely be a good steward of the White House’s interior decor. Combined with his affinity for U.S. history, he may choose to switch up some of the busts and portraits in the storied halls, and may enjoy giving White House tours to visiting students. How he might decorate the White House for Christmas: In black and white, matching one of their favorite films, Casablanca, which Mann and Warren watch every New Year’s Eve together. What designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: While it may be hard to get Mann out of his apparent favorite fashion staple, the quarter-zip sweater, our bets are that for the inaugural ball he’d sport a traditional suit by a U.S.-based designer. Score 1-10 as an Instagram husband: 8/10 ― Mann gets a high score for his regular appearances in Warren’s Instagram posts, including casually passing on her offer for a beer during an Instagram live video: “I’ll pass on a beer for now,” he said. “Enjoy your beer.” However, he gets docked a couple of points for not having an Instagram of his own dedicated to highlighting Warren’s accomplishments or their occasionally matching outfits. A post shared by Kamala Harris (@kamalaharris) on Jun 17, 2018 at 10:47am PDT His job: Emhoff, 54, is a “dad, hubby, lawyer, wannabe golfer,” according to his Twitter account. He is currently a partner at DLA Piper law firm focused on intellectual property litigation. According to his bio on the site, he’s passionate about legal aid, human rights, social justice and the well-being of children. He has two college-aged children, Cole and Ella, from a previous marriage, and when he’s not working on a case or supporting his wife on the campaign trail, he can be found golfing, maintaining his fantasy football team or helping his wife in the kitchen, Vogue reported. Where he lives: Emhoff and Harris moved to Brentwood, California, shortly after they were married. Where he grew up: Emhoff was born in New York. He moved to California to study law at the University of Southern California ― a lucky move, as it was in the Golden State that he later met the woman who could become Madam President. How he and the senator first met: Harris and her future hubby met on a blind date set up by one of her friends. They got engaged on March 27, 2014, with Emhoff dropping to one knee in Harris’ San Francisco apartment and presenting her with a diamond and platinum engagement ring. (Spoiler: she said yes). The couple had an intimate wedding that August at a Santa Barbara Courthouse, where Harris’ sister, Maya Harris West, officiated and they honored Emhoff’s Jewish heritage by breaking a glass after the “I do’s.” Mazel tov! How he’s supported his wife in her political career: Though Emhoff is typically out of the public eye, he is his wife’s biggest fan and shows it with a social media presence largely comprised of tweets about and retweets of Harris’ platform and accolades. Emhoff will likely continue to be Harris’ main cheerleader as she takes on Trump and maybe takes the White House. Fun fact: Emhoff’s aforementioned fantasy football team is named “Nirvana” after the band. Sounds like someone has a go-to karaoke song in his back pocket... Best guess at the cause he’d choose as first gentleman: According to his bio for his law firm, Emhoff is passionate about many charitable causes, including those that impact the well-being of children. Emhoff may focus on education, the foster care system, children’s hospitals or any other area that would promote the well-being of America’s future generations. Most likely domestic household initiative he’ll take on: Harris spends a great deal of time in the kitchen planning meals and menus, but as the potential leader of the free world, her plate is likely going to be too full to continue to be a master chef. So First Gentleman Emhoff will have to graduate from “sous chef” and make sure the White House kitchen is preparing all of Kamala’s favorite comfort foods exactly the way wifey would make it. How he might decorate the White House for Christmas: Emhoff and Harris post holiday cards to her Instagram page every Christmas. His decor style is likely traditional and welcoming, just like the cards ― think classic golds, greens and reds on the tallest pine trees in every corner and crevice. Emhoff is Jewish, so it would make sense for him to use the holidays as an opportunity to pay homage to his heritage and holiday celebrations across cultures. The Harris White House in December would likely be a spot of multicultural celebration. What designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: Emhoff tends to favor a simple blue button up and jacket in most photographs of the couple out and about, so he’d likely go for a designer who can keep things simple and comfortable, yet chic ― perhaps Chanel for a classic, sophisticated look. We’d have them know that the man also looks great in a bowtie. Score 1-10 as an Instagram husband: Unfortunately, Emhoff doesn’t seem to have an Instagram account of his own, but his presence on his wife’s page is a 10 out of 10. Not only is he a perfect selfie partner, posing for date night pics and holiday photos that could be in a Hallmark card, but he’s also comfortable behind the camera, snapping pics of his wife on the road and on TV. He’s her personal paparazzi. A post shared by Kirsten Gillibrand (@kirstengillibrand) on Dec 10, 2018 at 6:22am PST His job: Jonathan Gillibrand, 50, is a business consultant. Sen. Gillibrand told New York Family in 2013 that, over the course of their marriage, Jonathan has held “different jobs and [had] different levels of flexibility.” Where he lives: In 2011, the Gillibrands purchased a house in Brunswick, New York near Sen. Gillibrand’s family, which remains their primary residence. Where he grew up: Jonathan is a Brit! He grew up in the United Kingdom and came to the United States to study abroad at Columbia University and get his MBA. He only planned to stay for a year, but then he met Kirsten. How he and the senator first met: The Gillibrands met on a blind date while Jonathan was studying in New York City at Columbia University. At the time, Sen. Gillibrand was a lawyer in the city. “I thought he was one of the nicest and kindest people I’d ever met,” the senator told Vogue in 2010, describing her first date with her future husband. “That’s what charmed me.” Their second date involved going to mass together at St. Ignatius, on the Upper East Side. How he’s supported his wife in her political career: Sen. Gillibrand has long maintained that her husband is incredibly supportive of her political ambitions. She told New York Family that Jonathan “really believes in what [she’s] doing in Washington,” adding that he once told her: “As long as you’re making a difference, as long as you’re helping people, this is something we’re going to do. And the day that you’re not is the day we’re not going to do it!” However, the senator told Vogue that the one part of the job her husband has trouble with is when she gets publicly attacked. “He gets very upset,” she said. Fun fact: Jonathan proposed using a snowball with a ring in it, which Sen. Gillibrand almost threw at a squirrel instead of opening it up. Best guess at the cause he’d choose as first gentleman: As a business consultant, perhaps he could focus on pushing comprehensive financial education for young people. Most likely domestic household initiative he’ll take on: As a British national, Jonathan could be instrumental in helping to host foreign events for dignitaries and build bridges between the U.S. and its allies. (Also… the china. He’s gotta pick out the White House china.) How he might decorate the White House for Christmas: Unclear exactly what his decorating style would be ― maybe a simple red and white plaid motif? ― but we think he’d definitely want pints of Guinness served at the White House Christmas Party. What designer he should wear to the Inaugural Ball: Jonathan seems to favor simple button-ups and sweaters, but we’re sure he would dress it up for an inaugural ball. The real question is, would he favor a designer from his native U.K. or an American designer, like Tom Ford? It seems likely that he’d go full American patriot for the occasion, just as American Meghan Markle chose a British designer for her royal wedding gown. Score 1-10 as an Instagram husband: 7/10 ― Jonathan is a fairly private person, but he seems pretty game to show up for photos with his wife and kids (Theodore Ignatius and Henry Nelson). These Insta appearances are especially frequent during the holidays, like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Halloween, or on special occasions, like Sen. Gillibrand’s birthday.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-san-francisco-immigrant-policy_n_5c758153e4b0bf166204509b---split---A few years ago a teenager in San Francisco made a mistake that landed him in immigration detention. One day after school, the 13-year-old punched his classmate and stole 46 cents. The student, an undocumented immigrant from Australia, apologized, but the school called the police, who turned the teen over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE detained him for a few days and threatened to deport him and his family. “He was traumatized and he was scared,” said Angela Chan, the policy director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice — Asian Law Caucus and the immigration attorney who represented the boy and his family. “It is a human rights violation to separate a young child from their family for an adolescent mistake,” Chan told HuffPost. It was no accident the teenager ended up detained by ICE back in 2010. More than 100 immigrant youth in San Francisco were detained or deported because of a 2008 city policy implemented by former mayor and now-Gov. Gavin Newsom and supported by Kamala Harris, then the city’s district attorney, who is now a Democratic senator running for president. Though San Francisco is a sanctuary city, the policy required police to notify ICE about undocumented youth arrested for felonies, in some cases for minor crimes. The juveniles were handed over even before guilt or innocence was proved. Immigration advocates told HuffPost that Harris needs to publicly revoke her support for the legislation and acknowledge the trauma it caused San Francisco’s undocumented youth and their families. Otherwise, they say, she cannot be a credible voice on immigrant rights, an issue that will be at the forefront of the 2020 election. “This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in San Francisco in the last 30 years,” said Francisco Ugarte, the managing immigration attorney with San Francisco’s Public Defender’s Office. After the publication of this article, Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams told HuffPost that the senator “thinks the policy was a mistake and wouldn’t support something like it today.” Prior to publication, Harris had defended her support for the policy, which was changed in 2011 when Newsom left office. On Feb. 11, Sams said in a statement to CNN that the policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco and to ensure police maintained strong relationships with immigrant communities. “Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly,” Sams said. In an interview Sunday with Political Party Live, a podcast about Iowa politics, Harris said the fact that juveniles were turned over to ICE before they were even convicted of a felony was an “unintended consequence” that she did not support. But immigration advocates say the stated purpose of the policy was to report undocumented youth to immigration authorities without giving them due process and told HuffPost that Harris’ statement is confusing and contradictory. “Until she recognizes that what she did was a mistake, I don’t think she will have the credibility of a champion,” said David Campos, chairman of the San Francisco Democratic Party and former member of the city’s Board of Supervisors. Harris’ statement references the fact that last year, Newsom told The Sacramento Bee that his policy was designed to protect San Francisco’s sanctuary status, which limits the city’s cooperation with ICE, at a time when it was under attack by the federal government because of a high-profile triple murder committed by an undocumented immigrant. Newsom said he thought his 2008 legislation was a compromise that would appease critics enough to leave the city’s sanctuary ordinance intact. Chan, the lawyer for the teenager detained by ICE, said Newsom’s policy created panic in the community and undercut any trust immigrants had in police. The threat of deportation made immigrant victims and witnesses afraid to report crimes, she said, and immigrant parents were fearful of sending their kids to school in case the police got involved in a classroom incident. Harris’ supporters have pointed out that she has a record of fighting for immigrant rights. In a statement to HuffPost, her campaign spokesperson highlighted Harris’ crackdown on trafficking, her push for temporary visa protections for crime victims, her support of DACA, and the legal services she provided to unaccompanied minors as California’s attorney general as a few examples. “Senator Harris has been a champion for immigrants throughout her career,” said the spokesperson. “She will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to protect Dreamers, their families, and TPS recipients as president.” Some immigration advocates say it’s unfair to criticize Harris on a policy she didn’t herself create, especially given her track record on immigrant rights. Alida Garcia, the vice-president of advocacy for the group FWD.us, tweeted that Harris is one of the most proactive senators on immigration issues and Frank Sharry, the founder and executive director of America’s Voice, tweeted that he didn’t think Harris’ support for the 2008 policy would hurt her reputation. Still, some said they couldn’t consider Harris a credible voice on immigration until she properly addresses and takes responsibility for her support of Newsom’s 2008 policy. “There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of California’s past,” said Salvador Sarmiento, the national campaign coordinator for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. “We expect all officials to recognize their mistakes and rectify them so that we can be sure they will mitigate the harm these policies have caused on our communities.” Carrie Rosenbaum, a San Francisco-based immigration attorney, told HuffPost that she is disappointed the senator didn’t revoke her support for Newsom’s 2008 policy and explain why her stance has changed. “Standing by the policy undermines her position as a supporter of immigrant rights,” Rosenbaum said, adding that if Harris really stands by the legislation, “she should be more forthcoming with voters about the ways in which her role as a prosecutor influences her views on immigration enforcement.” While Ugarte, the public defender, says Harris has been moving in a more progressive direction on immigration by vocally opposing the Trump administration’s family separation policy and travel ban, he’s concerned that her recent comments about the need for “smart border security” evoke Obama-era rhetoric that resulted in the mass deportation of immigrants. Ugarte said that if Harris doesn’t talk about defunding ICE and ending “collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration,” advocates “have legitimate reason to be concerned about what she would do if she were president of the U.S.” But, he added, Harris first needs to vocally renounce her support for the 2008 immigration policy. “If she wants to be someone who can stand up against Donald Trump and against the demonization of immigrants,” Ugarte said, “then taking a look at what happened in San Francisco in 2008 is a very important thing.” The 13-year-old who was detained by ICE in 2010 for instigating a fight with his classmate was ultimately not deported back to Australia. But he and his family were allowed to stay in the U.S. only because their lawyer, Chan, launched an aggressive media campaign. She says many other families weren’t as lucky. “We don’t know what happened to those kids,” Chan said. “I can’t imagine how difficult it was to make a mistake and end up being deported.” This article has been updated with additional comments from Alida Garcia, Frank Sharry and the Harris campaign.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/republicans-greet-north-carolina-voting-scandal-crickets-excuses-misdirection---split---Republican Mark Harris, left, will not run in the do-over of the election in North Carolina’s 9th District. Above, Harris campaigns with North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd in Charlotte last October. (Sean Rayford/Getty Images file photo) [OPINION] CHARLOTTE, N.C. — America might know the name of the next president before voters in North Carolina’s 9th District have a representative in the House. OK, maybe that’s an exaggeration. But one sure thing is that Mark Harris, the Republican who thought he won last fall, attended an orientation for new members of Congress and was picking out an office — won’t be the new congressman. He cited health reasons in taking himself out of the race that has no end in sight. The GOP, known for relentlessly pursuing voting restrictions to prevent practically nonexistent in-person voter fraud, has been pretty silent about this all-too-real, high-profile case of probable election fraud that benefited a Republican. And that is not an exaggeration, or very surprising. The scandal that has, again, moved North Carolina into the political spotlight — and not in a good way — is far from over, as the State Board of Elections has called for a new election. In this case that means running a new primary and general election, which extends this undecided race into the fall. In the latest developments, the Wake County district attorney announced Wednesday that McCrae Dowless, the political operative and ex-felon at the center of the case, had been indicted on charges related to his collection of absentee ballots during elections in 2018 and 2016. Others involved in the operation also could face charges. Ah, North Carolina politics — at worst criminal, at best ridiculous. Also watch: What race ratings really mean and how we create them So why do Republicans rush to pass laws to prevent ineligible voters showing up at the polls while staying mum about actual election fraud that causes a rare do-over of a House race? Hypocrisy is too mild a word. In North Carolina, the fight to establish a law requiring certain types of voter ID and more obstacles that data show are particularly onerous for minorities, young people, the elderly and the poor has dragged on for years. The latest iteration is being challenged by multiple lawsuits, while a previous one was tossed out by the courts for targeting African-American voters with “almost surgical precision.” Despite previous clues about illegal goings-on with absentee ballots in two North Carolina counties, it took a close result in a November contest between former Baptist pastor Harris and Democrat Dan McCready to begin this latest investigation. (The district may not even exist in the future because the state’s gerrymandered map is also being contested.) Testimony in the case was dramatic with a whiff of family tragedy when John Harris, 29, the former candidate’s son and assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, said in the public hearing that he had warned his father about Dowless’ reputation and had told him “collecting absentee ballots was a felony.” It contradicted the recollection of his father, who soon after called for a new election, backed up by a unanimous bipartisan vote by the board. It was only last October at a rally in Charlotte that Harris stood side by side with and spoke eloquently of Donald Trump, who reciprocated with a hearty endorsement. When asked about this latest scandal, Trump quickly deflected to what he has said are Democrat-orchestrated voting irregularities. He also resorted to the “both sides” rhetoric that marked his response to the white nationalist and neo-Nazi marches in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the murder of counterprotester Heather Heyer. It’s about what you would expect from a president whose Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, searching for folks putting on hats and fake noses to vote as different people and all the “illegals” who supposedly gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win in 2016, was disbanded for lack of evidence of any such thing. In another astonishing example of “Who do you believe, me or your lying eyes?” Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the North Carolina case was proof that the GOP’s cries of voter fraud were true after all. However, McConnell failed to mention that the impersonation craziness Republican-sponsored voter ID bills would stop hardly ever happens, while absentee ballot shenanigans, far easier to pull off, are mostly untouched by the GOP. Not even the wily Senate majority leader was able to pull off that jiujitsu move. If Republicans in Washington were serious about the issue, they would engage in a debate on the first bill proposed by House Democrats this session, which takes up anti-corruption and ethics reform and voting rights provisions. But McConnell has said: “That’s not going to go anywhere.” Back in North Carolina, you would think the expected scrutiny would be incentive enough to run a squeaky clean new race, or to lead to a temporary end to toxic ends-justify-the-means electioneering. So what is happening next? Democrat McCready, as expected, is running again; his campaign and the DNC are reaching out to donors inside and outside the state. “It’s about our democracy. That’s why we’re still fighting,” he tweeted. In the GOP primary, Harris has endorsed Stony Rushing, a county commissioner in Union County, a socially conservative Republican stronghold. Rushing, who has proved to be a huge vote-getter in Union, is the owner of Take Aim Training Range, across the border in South Carolina, which offers classes and sells firearms. On his Facebook page, under an American flag, he posted: “Dan McCready and his establishment friends just threw ALL of our ballots in the Trash! What are We Going to Do About IT?” Expect more Republicans to join the fray, though Robert Pittenger, the former congressman beaten by Harris in their GOP primary last year (also under suspicious, though as yet unproven circumstances) has said he’s not interested.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends January 30, 2019 By Anthony Cilluffo and Richard Fry The 2020 U.S. presidential election is rapidly coming into view – and so is the electorate that will determine its outcome. While demographic changes unfold slowly, it’s already clear that the 2020 electorate will be unique in several ways. Nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters – their largest share ever – driven by long-term increases among certain groups, especially Hispanics. At the same time, one-in-ten eligible voters will be members of Generation Z, the Americans who will be between the ages 18 and 23 next year. That will occur as Millennials and all other older generations account for a smaller share of eligible voters than they did in 2016.  Pew Research Center defines the electorate as all citizens ages 18 and older living in the United States. We don’t account for those who have lost their voting rights, such as people convicted of felonies living in certain states, or those who can vote from outside the U.S., such as citizens living abroad and members of the armed forces stationed in other countries.  What might these demographic shifts mean politically? In 2016, nonwhite voters were more likely to back Democrat Hillary Clinton, while white voters were more likely to back Republican Donald Trump. Younger generations, meanwhile, differ notably from older generations in their views on key social and political issues. It remains unclear how these patterns might factor into the 2020 election and, as always, a great deal will depend on who turns out to vote. We project that the 2020 election will mark the first time that Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13% of eligible voters – slightly more than blacks. This change reflects the gradual but continuous growth in the Hispanic share of eligible voters, up from 9% in the 2008 presidential election and 7% in the 2000 election. The black eligible voter population has grown about as fast as the electorate overall, meaning their share has held constant at about 12% since 2000. In raw numbers, a projected 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, compared with 30 million blacks. The population of Asians eligible to vote will reach an estimated 11 million in 2020, which is more than double the 5 million who were eligible to vote in 2000, accounting for 5% of next year’s electorate. Taken together, this strong growth among minority populations means that a third of eligible voters will be nonwhite in 2020, up from about a quarter in 2000. This increase is at least partially linked to immigration and naturalization patterns: One-in-ten eligible voters in the 2020 election will have been born outside the U.S., the highest share since at least 1970. Voter turnout will play an important role in determining the relative electoral influence of different racial and ethnic groups. For example, while Hispanics will outnumber blacks among eligible voters next year, they may not actually cast more ballots than blacks due to different turnout patterns. In recent presidential elections, blacks were substantially more likely than Hispanics to vote. Indeed, the number of Hispanic eligible voters who didn’t vote has exceeded the number of those who did vote in every presidential election since 1996.  Still, the changing racial and ethnic composition of the electorate likely has political implications in part because nonwhites have long been significantly more likely than whites to back Democratic candidates. For instance, in the 2016 election, white voters favored Donald Trump by a 15 percentage point margin, while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton. Another important long-term trend is the overall aging of the electorate. In 2020, nearly a quarter of the electorate (23%) will be ages 65 and older, the highest such share since at least 1970. This reflects not only the maturation of the large Baby Boom generation but also increased life expectancy among older Americans. Baby Boomers and older generations, who will be ages 56 and older next year, are expected to account for fewer than four-in-ten eligible voters in 2020. This is a significant change from 2000, when nearly seven-in-ten eligible voters (68%) were Boomers, Silents or members of the Greatest Generation (collectively, those ages 36 and older at the time). Even as recently as 2012, when the youngest Boomer was 48 years old, Boomer and older generations were about half of the electorate (49%). The next presidential election will also mark the first time that Millennials (who will be ages 24 to 39 in 2020) will account for a slightly smaller share of the electorate than they represented in the last presidential election. The raw number of Millennials eligible to vote is increasing due to foreign-born Millennials naturalizing to become citizens. But the Millennial share of the electorate has peaked as they are not growing as fast as the electorate overall. Meanwhile, the leading edge of Generation Z (people ages 18 to 23 in 2020) is projected to comprise one-in-ten eligible voters, up from just 4% in 2016, when the vast majority were too young to cast ballots. These post-Millennials are on track to be more racially and ethnically diverse than their predecessors: In 2020, Gen Z eligible voters are expected to be 55% white and 45% nonwhite, including 21% Hispanic, 14% black, and 4% Asian or Pacific Islander. By comparison, the Boomer and older electorate is projected to be about three-quarters white (74%).  Differences in turnout rates again matter when talking about generations and should be kept in mind as election season gets underway. Since older adults are more likely to turn out to vote, it’s possible that older generations will form a larger share of actual voters in 2020 than their share in the electorate. That’s what happened in 2016: Even though Boomers and older generations accounted for 43% of eligible voters, they cast 49% of the ballots.

But holding hearings and asking questions is only the first step in successful oversight, says Justin Rood, director of the Congressional Oversight Initiative at the Project on Government Oversight and a former staff investigator for Oklahoma GOP Sen. Tom Coburn. Congressional overseers must then grapple with their targets to make sure they cooperate, or cultivate whistleblowers who will provide information outside the standard channels.

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., arrives in the Capitol for a vote on Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) A senior Democratic senator has blocked a Trump administration proposed rule to switch oversight authority of firearm sales abroad from the State Department to the Commerce Department, arguing the move would significantly weaken congressional oversight and increase the risk of terrorists and criminals getting their hands on powerful military-grade weapons. Sen. Robert Menendez, ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, placed the hold last week after he was notified earlier this month about the proposed change by the State Department. Menendez is objecting to the final language of the rule. “Firearms and ammunition — especially those derived from military models ... are uniquely dangerous,” the New Jersey Democrat wrote in a Feb. 22 letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announcing his hold. “They should be subject to more, not less, rigorous export controls and oversight.” Hill staffers and outside experts are concerned President Donald Trump will disregard Menendez's hold, which is not legally binding but is based on decades of bipartisan tradition. The development of the rule change started under the Obama administration, and the Trump administration is now proposing it. The proposed rule change would switch oversight responsibility on exports of firearms, including semi-automatic pistols, sniper rifles and AK-47-type assault weapons from Foggy Bottom to the Commerce Department. Critics of the move say that human rights, terrorism and rule of law concerns would take a back seat when considering an export request. It would also, they say, make it more difficult for lawmakers to learn about and stop firearm sales they disagree with. Menendez has halted — for now — the regulatory change process, which would otherwise next move to a formal congressional notification period before the rule change would go into effect. The final rule has not been shared but an earlier version was published in May 2018 in the Federal Register. Supporters of the rule argue it will bring more efficiency to the firearm export control process and make it easier to investigate potential export violations as Commerce has more resources to commit to the matter than the State Department. “At the time, I liked the fact that Commerce has 105 special agents whose sole purpose is to investigate and enforce export control violations,” Kevin Wolf, a former assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration in the Obama administration, said in an interview. “That was actually part of my motive for supporting this, because of the added enforcement resources that would be provided to this. Commerce is better able to deal with non-military customers.” Wolf, now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump, said the Obama administration developed but never put forth the rule change because it occurred so close to the 2012 gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and the political climate for it never improved. But the core motive of the rule change, which was part of a broader regulatory overhaul of defense industry exports, “was for State to do what it did best and for Commerce to do what it did best,” he said. Also at issue is whether the State Department and other government agencies like the Pentagon will be able to block Commerce from approving an export request if the other agencies determine it is not in U.S. foreign policy or national security interests. “They will send possible license exports over to State for comment but they will be the ones making the final decision,” said a congressional aide, referring to the Commerce Department. “One of the reasons for doing this is fundamentally for export promotion, to make it easier to traffic in these arms abroad.” The staffer opposes the rule change and is not authorized to be quoted. But Wolf insisted that under the proposed rule, “Commerce must get consensus from the other agencies and any one agency can object.” If there is interagency disagreement about a proposed gun sale, the matter would be brought up the chain to higher agency officials, but how disputes ultimately would be settled is still unclear. “I’m an Obama appointee and I’m a gun-control Democrat,” Wolf said. “I am also just an export control person, who wanted a more efficient regulatory system to more properly [monitor] these dangerous items.” But rule opponents and supporters agree that Congress would be left in the dark on the majority of firearm exports. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the State Department is required to notify Congress about any proposed exports of lethal weapons worth $1 million or more that fall under the United States Munitions List. But the rule change would take firearms off the Munitions List and place them on the Commerce Control List, where they would be subject to much less congressional oversight including the pre-sale notification requirements contained in the export control law. Furthermore, the Commerce Department is not required to notify Congress, as the State Department is, when there is evidence that U.S. defense exports have been misused, according to a July 2018 report by the liberal Center for International Policy. The Center objects to the proposed rule change. In the past, lawmakers have used the notification period provided by the export control law to stop the proposed sale of guns to a number of problematic foreign governments that the State Department would otherwise have approved. In 2016 and 2017, lawmakers blocked separate Foggy Bottom proposals to export assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns to security services in the Philippines and Turkey due to human rights and rule of law concerns. Without that final backstop of congressional notification, human rights advocates argue that even the State Department will be more likely to give the go-ahead to exporting military-grade weapons to buyers who could use them against civilians. “It’s definitely the most dramatic reduction in export control since the creation of the Arms Export Control Act,” said Colby Goodman, an independent arms control analyst, who co-authored the Center for International Policy report. In the past few years, he said, “we know that Congress has played a pretty important role in reviewing arms control and human rights cases.” Among other things, Goodman’s report recommends the rule change not go forward until Congress’ internal watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, has completed an analysis on the risks of moving firearms from State's Munitions List to the Commerce Control List. For his part, Menendez has said he will not lift his hold until his concerns are addressed about how congressional oversight over foreign firearms sales will be maintained. Menendez is also demanding Commerce make a final legal determination on whether 3D-printed firearms, which are difficult for metal detectors to uncover, constitute an “emerging” technology. Such a determination would make it illegal for someone in America to upload to the Internet the blueprints for a 3D-printable firearm. The State Department until recently barred the posting online of 3D-printed gun designs, though a lawsuit has thrown the matter to the courts.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.npr.org/2019/03/01/698668688/as-u-s-jerusalem-consulate-shuts-pro-israel-envoy-to-handle-palestinian-relation---split---Daniel Estrin This old building had until now served as the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, which oversaw a key diplomatic line to Palestinian officials. Wikipedia hide caption This old building had until now served as the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, which oversaw a key diplomatic line to Palestinian officials. When the United States closes its Jerusalem Consulate on Monday, it will not only be winding down a 175-year diplomatic mission. The move also represents another major downgrade of the Trump administration's relations with the Palestinians. The Consulate General in Jerusalem is the U.S. government's de facto representative office to the Palestinian Authority. The diplomatic mission, first established in 1844 and housed in a historical stone estate in downtown Jerusalem, will be downgraded to a Palestinian Affairs Unit and will merge with the new U.S. Embassy to Israel. Consul General Karen Sasahara, who has served as an unofficial ambassador to the Palestinians, is leaving Jerusalem and won't be replaced. A lower-ranking foreign service officer will head the new unit. U.S Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, a longtime supporter of Israel's West Bank settler movement whom Palestinians see as their ideological opponent, will oversee diplomatic relations with the Palestinians and Israelis both. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the move, which he announced in October, will "improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations." Palestinian officials view it as a hostile move. "The U.S. administration had a choice to build constructive relations with the Palestinian people and leadership. Instead, it chose bullying and arrogance," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Maliki said in a statement. A U.S. official told NPR that at least one dissent cable opposing the consulate closure had been sent to senior officials in Washington. The official was unauthorized to speak to the media about the internal diplomatic matter, and spoke on condition of anonymity. State Department officers use the practice of sending dissent cables in rare cases to discreetly protest major policy decisions. Since the mid-1990s, the Consulate General has served as the U.S. diplomatic mission dealing directly with the Palestinian leadership, while the embassy has worked closely with Israel. U.S. officials viewed the dynamic as providing diplomatic symmetry amid Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. "Historically the position of Washington has been, the two should not be merged," said Ed Abington, a former U.S. consul general in Jerusalem. "Now they're merged. The effect on our ability to deal with the Palestinians is being greatly damaged." The mission merger is the latest contentious U.S. step regarding the Palestinians. Last year, the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, endorsing Israel's claims to the city but enraging Palestinians who also have claims there and drawing international criticism. Palestinian authorities cut off ties with U.S. officials in protest. Then the U.S. closed the Palestinians' diplomatic office in Washington and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian and development aid for Palestinians. Lara Friedman, a former U.S. foreign service officer in Jerusalem and president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, called the consulate closure "a massive shift" in U.S. policy. "At this point we are saying to the Palestinians and the world — we do not see the Palestinians as a people to engage directly. They are now a minority and a subset to our relationship with Israel," said Friedman, who is not related to the ambassador. The stately three-story mansion, with arched windows and bougainvillea-covered walls, was where the unofficial envoy to the Palestinians has lived and hosted Palestinian guests. The consul general threw Fourth of July parties for mostly Palestinians in the manicured courtyard. The estate will now be the domain of Ambassador Friedman to host events and perhaps use as a residence. For years, the Consulate General monitored and reported directly to Washington on the situation in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza — focal points of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now diplomatic cables will pass through the office of Ambassador Friedman, who will have the authority to censor or reject communiqués, and set priorities for what political officers report. "Given the ideological leanings of Ambassador Friedman, it seems to me that ... you have a big filter on reporting that's taking place," said former Consul General Abington. Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the consulate closure. But Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., called it positive. "I would have no objections for the U.S. to have a consulate in Ramallah, for instance, for the Palestinians," Shoval said, referring to the West Bank city where the Palestinian Authority is headquartered. "But to have a separate consulate in another part of Jerusalem creates a certain fact of splitting Jerusalem into two parts, something which Israel is opposed to." Scott Lasensky, former adviser to the U.S. ambassador to Israel under the Obama administration, said there were "gross inefficiencies and convoluted lines of authority" with the consulate general and embassy working separately. But he added that the merger "will be widely perceived as a dismantling of previous U.S. policies that positioned Washington as the lead peace broker and advocate for a two-state solution." The consulate closure is subject to a congressional review period, according to U.S. officials, but it is unclear if any Congress members registered any formal objections to the mission merger. House Foreign Affairs Committee staffers did not return NPR's requests for comment. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy's office said he objected to the move, but his office was not aware of any congressional review process. "It downgrades our diplomatic posture with the Palestinians at a time when the Trump administration is cutting aid and tightening the screws on the Palestinians, and restricting our engagement with them, apparently believing they can be pressured into supporting the White House's yet to be revealed Middle East peace plan. To the contrary, it has only increased the Palestinians' desperation and distrust, widened the gap between us and them, further damaged our credibility as a mediator, and made the prospects for peace more elusive," Leahy's office said in a statement to NPR. White House adviser Jared Kushner says the administration will present its still-secret Israeli-Palestinian peace plan after Israeli elections in April. Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. Mideast negotiator, said the consulate-embassy merger offers a clue about how the Trump administration approaches the question of creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which was longtime U.S. policy. "The administration seems to view Israel-Palestine as more or less one and the same," Miller said, "and that they're thinking not of a two-state solution but something along the lines of a Palestinian state-minus."

---split---3.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Social & Demographic Trends Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out in views on race, climate and the role of government By Kim Parker, Nikki Graf and Ruth Igielnik  No longer the new kids on the block, Millennials have moved firmly into their 20s and 30s, and a new generation is coming into focus. Generation Z – diverse and on track to be the most well-educated generation yet – is moving toward adulthood with a liberal set of attitudes and an openness to emerging social trends. On a range of issues, from Donald Trump’s presidency to the role of government to racial equality and climate change, the views of Gen Z – those ages 13 to 21 in 2018 – mirror those of Millennials.1 In each of these realms, the two younger generations hold views that differ significantly from those of their older counterparts. In most cases, members of the Silent Generation are at the opposite end, and Baby Boomers and Gen Xers fall in between.2 It’s too early to say with certainty how the views of this new generation will evolve. Most have yet to reach voting age, and their outlook could be altered considerably by changing national conditions, world events or technological innovations. Even so, two new Pew Research Center surveys, one of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 and one of adults ages 18 and older, provide some compelling clues about where they may be headed and how their views could impact the nation’s political landscape. Only about three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials (30% and 29%, respectively) approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president. This compares with 38% of Gen Xers, 43% of Boomers and 54% of Silents. Similarly, while majorities in Gen Z and the Millennial generation say government should do more to solve problems, rather than that government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals, Gen Xers and Boomers are more evenly divided on this issue. For their part, most Silents would like to see a less activist government. When it comes to views on race, the two younger generations are more likely than older generations to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the United States today. And they are much more likely than their elders to approve of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a sign of protest. The younger generations are also more accepting of some of the ways in which American society is changing. Majorities among Gen Z and the Millennial generation say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society, while older generations are less convinced of this. And they’re more likely to have a positive view of interracial and same-sex marriage than their older counterparts. As a recent Pew Research Center report highlighted, Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation we have seen, but this isn’t all that’s driving the attitudes of this generation when it comes to issues surrounding race and diversity. There are significant, if more modest, generational differences on these issues even among non-Hispanic whites. While Generation Z’s views resemble those of Millennials in many areas, Gen Zers are distinct from Millennials and older generations in at least two ways, both of which reflect the cultural context in which they are coming of age. Gen Zers are more likely than Millennials to say they know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns to refer to them: 35% say this is the case, compared with a quarter of Millennials. Among each older generation, the share saying this drops: 16% of Gen Xers, 12% of Boomers and just 7% of Silents say this. The youngest generation is also the most likely to say forms or online profiles that ask about a person’s gender should include options other than “man” or “woman.” Roughly six-in-ten Gen Zers (59%) hold this view, compared with half of Millennials and four-in-ten or fewer Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. These findings seem to speak more to exposure than to viewpoint, as roughly equal shares of Gen Zers and Millennials say society should be more accepting of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman. Members of Gen Z also stand out somewhat in their views on the role social media plays in modern news consumption. These teens and young adults are much less likely than older generations to say the fact that more people are getting their news from social media is a bad thing for society – 39% of Gen Zers hold this view, compared with about half among each of the older generations. While they are young and their political views may not be fully formed, there are signs that those in Generation Z who identify as Republican or lean to the Republican Party diverge somewhat from older Republicans – even Millennials – in their views on several key issues. These same generational divides are not as apparent among Democrats. On views about race relations, Gen Z Republicans are more likely than older generations of Republicans to say that blacks are treated less fairly than whites. Among Republicans, 43% of Gen Zers say this, compared with 30% of Millennials and roughly 20% of Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Z Republicans are also much more likely than their GOP counterparts in older generations to say increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S. is a good thing for society. On each of these measures, Democrats’ views are nearly uniform across generations. In addition, the youngest Republicans stand apart in their views on the role of government and the causes of climate change. Gen Z Republicans are much more likely than Republicans in older generations to say government should do more to solve problems. And they are less likely than their older counterparts to attribute the earth’s warming temperatures to natural patterns, as opposed to human activity. While younger and older Americans differ in many of their views, there are some areas where generation is not as clearly linked with attitudes. When it comes to the merits of having more women running for political office, majorities across generations say this is a good thing for the country. Majorities in each generation also say that, on balance, legal immigrants have had a positive impact on the U.S. This analysis is based on a survey of 920 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 conducted online Sept. 17-Nov. 25, 2018, combined with a nationally representative survey of 10,682 adults ages 18 and older conducted online Sept. 24-Oct. 7, 2018, using Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.3 Findings based on Generation Z combine data from the teens survey with data from the 18- to 21-year-old respondents in the adult survey. When it comes to views on political issues and the current political climate, younger generations have consistently held more liberal views than older generations in recent years. Today, members of Generation Z hold many similar views to Millennials, and both tend to be more liberal than older generations. Seven-in-ten Gen Zers say the government should do more to solve problems in this country, while just 29% say the government is doing too many things that are better left to individuals and businesses. Gen Zers are slightly more likely to favor government activism than Millennials, and significantly more likely than older generations: 53% of Gen Xers, 49% of Baby Boomers and 39% of Silents favor government involvement over businesses and individuals. Among Republicans and those who lean to the Republican Party, the generational divides are even starker. Roughly half (52%) of Gen Z Republicans say they think the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 38% of Millennial Republicans and 29% of Gen Xers. About a quarter of Republican Baby Boomers (23%) and fewer GOP Silents (12%) believe the government should be doing more. Among Democrats, however, these generational divides largely disappear. Roughly eight-in-ten Gen Z (81%) and Millennial Democrats (79%) say the government should do more to solve problems, as do about seven-in-ten Democratic Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents. Gen Zers’ views about climate change are virtually identical to those of Millennials and not markedly different from Gen Xers. About half in all three generations say the earth is getting warmer due to human activity. Boomers are somewhat more skeptical of this than Gen Zers or Millennials. Members of the Silent Generation are least likely to say this (38%) and are more likely to say the earth is warming mainly due to natural patterns (28%) than are Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers. Among Republicans, Gen Z stands out from older generations as the least likely to say the earth is warming because of natural patterns – 18% say this. By comparison, 30% of Millennial, 36% of Gen X and roughly four-in-ten Boomer (42%) and Silent Generation Republicans (41%) say the same. Almost no generation gap exists among Democrats in views on this issue. When it comes to views of Donald Trump, there are sizable generational divides, particularly among Republicans. Nine-in-ten Republicans in the Silent Generation approve of the job the president is doing, as do 85% of Baby Boomer Republicans and 76% of Gen X Republicans; smaller majorities of GOP Millennials (65%) and Gen Zers (59%) think he’s doing a good job. Younger generations also have a different view of the U.S. relative to other countries in the world. While pluralities of nearly all generations (with the exception of the Silent Generation) say the U.S. is one of the best countries in the world along with some others, Gen Zers and Millennials are the least likely to say the U.S. is better than all other countries. Only 14% and 13%, respectively, hold this view, compared with one-in-five Gen Xers, 30% of Boomers and 45% of Silents. Roughly three-in-ten Gen Zers and Millennials say there are other countries that are better than the U.S. In their views about the general direction of the country, Gen Zers are mostly downbeat, but they’re not alone in that assessment. Among Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers, two-thirds or more say things in this country are generally going in the wrong direction. About six-in-ten Boomers (61%) say the same. Members of the Silent Generation have a less negative view (53% say things are going in the wrong direction). Today’s 13- to 21-year-olds are only slightly more likely than Millennials to say ordinary citizens can do a lot to influence the government in Washington (53% of Gen Zers say this vs. 46% of Millennials). And their views on this issue don’t differ much from those of Gen Xers, Boomers or Silents (50%, 58% and 58%, respectively, say citizens can have a lot of influence on the government). Younger generations have a different perspective than their older counterparts on the treatment of blacks in the United States. Two-thirds of Gen Z (66%) and 62% of Millennials say blacks are treated less fairly than whites in the U.S. Fewer Gen Xers (53%), Boomers (49%) and Silents (44%) say this. Roughly half of Silents (44%) say both races are treated about equally, compared with just 28% among Gen Z. The patterns are similar after controlling for race: Younger generations of white Americans are far more likely than whites in older generations to say blacks are not receiving fair treatment. Younger generations also have a different viewpoint on the issue of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem as a protest. Majorities among Gen Z (61%) and the Millennial generation (62%) approve of the protests. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (44%) and Baby Boomers (37%) favor these actions. Members of the Silent Generation disapprove of the protests by a more than two-to-one margin (68% disapprove, 29% approve). Gen Zers and Millennials share similar views about racial and ethnic change in the country. Roughly six-in-ten from each generation say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (52% say this is a good thing), and older generations are even less likely to view this positively. Younger Republicans again stand out in this regard. Half of Gen Z Republicans (51%) say increased racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing for the country. This compares with 38% of Millennial, 34% of Gen X, 30% of Boomer and 28% of Silent Generation Republicans. Among Democrats, there is widespread agreement across generations. Though they differ in their views over the changing racial and ethnic makeup of the country, across generations most Americans agree about the impact that legal immigrants have on society. On balance, all generations see legal immigration as more positive than negative. Across most generations, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say legal immigrants are having a positive impact. However, within Gen Z there is no partisan gap on this issue. When it comes to views about how careful people should be in using potentially offensive language, members of Gen Z are divided over whether people need to be more careful or if concerns about political correctness have gone too far. Some 46% of Gen Zers say people need to be more careful about the language they use to avoid offending people with different backgrounds, while 53% say too many people are easily offended these days over the language that others use. Gen Zers’ views are only modestly different from those of Millennials and Gen Xers on this topic: 39% and 38%, respectively, say people need to be more careful about the language they use, while about six-in-ten say people are too easily offended these days. Interestingly, members of the Silent Generation are closer to members of Gen Z in their views on this topic than they are to Boomers, Gen Xers or Millennials. Since they first entered adulthood, Millennials have been at the leading edge of changing views on same-sex marriage. In 2014, when a narrow majority of all adults (52%) said they favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, 67% of Millennials held that view. Today, members of Generation Z are just as likely as Millennials to say allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry has been a good thing for the country (48% of Gen Zers and 47% of Millennials hold this view). One-third of Gen Xers say this is a good thing for the country, as do 27% of Baby Boomers. Members of the Silent Generation are the least enthusiastic (18% say this is a good thing). Relatively few Gen Zers or Millennials (15%) say same-sex marriage is a bad thing for society. Boomers and Silents are much more likely to view this change negatively (32% and 43%, respectively, say this is a bad thing). Across generations, about four-in-ten say allowing gays and lesbians to marry hasn’t made much of a difference for the U.S. In other ways, too, Gen Zers and Millennials are similar in their openness to changes that are affecting the institutions of marriage and family. Roughly half (53%) from each generation say interracial marriage is a good thing for our society. Gen Xers are somewhat less likely to agree (41% say this is a good thing), and older generations are much less likely to view interracial marriage positively. Relatively few across generations say this trend is bad for society; majorities of Silents (66%) and Boomers (60%) say it doesn’t make much difference, as do 53% of Xers. When it comes to couples living together without being married, roughly two-thirds of each generation (with the exception of Silents) say this doesn’t make much of a difference for society. About one-in-five Gen Zers and Millennials say cohabitation is a good thing for society – higher than the shares for older generations. Fully 41% of Silents say this is bad thing for the country, as do about a quarter of Boomers. Compared with their views on cohabitation, the youngest generations have a more negative assessment of the impact of single women raising children: 35% among Gen Z and 36% of Millennials say this is a bad thing for society; roughly four-in-ten Gen Xers and Boomers and 48% of Silents say the same. About half of Gen Zers and Millennials say this doesn’t make much difference for society, while relatively few (15%) view it as a good thing. In their views about gender roles within couples, members of Generation Z are virtually identical to Millennials and Gen Xers and quite similar to Baby Boomers. Large majorities in all four groups say that, in households with a mother and a father, the responsibility for providing for the family financially should be shared equally. About one-in-five Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers – and a quarter of Boomers – say this responsibility should fall primarily on the fathers. Very few say mothers should be mostly responsible for this. Silents are the outliers on this issue: 40% say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for their families financially, while 58% say this responsibility should be shared between mothers and fathers. For the most part, there are no notable gender gaps in views on this issue; the Silent Generation is the exception. Among Gen Zers, Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers, male and female respondents are largely in agreement that mothers and fathers should share family financial responsibility. Among members of the Silent Generation, roughly half of men (49%) but 33% of women say fathers should be mostly responsible for providing for the family financially. Large majorities (84% or more) across generations say that responsibility for taking care of children should be shared by mothers and fathers in households with two parents. Some 13% among Gen Z say this responsibility should fall mainly to mothers; similar shares of each of the other generations say the same. Very few say raising children should fall mostly to dads. Male and female respondents across generations have similar views on this issue. A majority of Americans, regardless of generation, view the increasing number of women running for public office as a positive change for our society. Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers, Millennials and Gen Xers say this is a good thing, as do 61% of Boomers and 55% of Silents. About four-in-ten in the Silent Generation (39%) say this trend doesn’t make much difference for society, somewhat higher than the share among the three youngest generations (roughly three-in-ten). There are significant gender gaps on this question, with female respondents expressing much more enthusiasm about the growing number of women running for office in each generation except the Silents. Among Gen Zers, 76% of young women, versus 57% of young men, say the fact that more women are running for office is a good thing for society. The pattern is similar for Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers. However, among Silents, roughly equal shares of men (57%) and women (54%) say this is a good thing. The recognition of people who don’t identify as a man or a woman has garnered increased attention amid changing laws concerning gender options on official documents and growing usage of gender-neutral pronouns. There are stark generational differences in views on these issues. Generation Z is the most likely of the five generations to say that when a form or online profile asks about a person’s gender it should include options other than “man” and “woman”; a 59% majority of Gen Zers say this. Half of Millennials say forms or online profiles should include additional gender options, as do about four-in-ten Gen Xers (40%) and Boomers (37%) and roughly a third of those in the Silent Generation (32%). These views vary widely along partisan lines, with generational differences evident within each party coalition, but sharpest among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. About four-in-ten Republican Gen Zers (41%) think forms should include other gender options, compared with 27% of Republican Millennials, 17% of GOP Gen Xers and Boomers and 16% of Republican Silents. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, half or more in all generations say this, including 71% of Gen Zers and 55% of Silents. When it comes to how accepting society in general is of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman, the views of Gen Zers and Millennials differ from those of older generations. Roughly half of Gen Zers (50%) and Millennials (47%) think that society is not accepting enough. Smaller shares of Gen Xers (39%), Boomers (36%) and those in the Silent Generation (32%) say the same. A plurality of the Silent Generation (41%) say society is too accepting of people who don’t identify as a man or woman. Across all generations, roughly a quarter say society’s acceptance level is about right. Again, there are large partisan gaps on this question, and Gen Z Republicans stand apart to some extent from other generations of Republicans in their views. Among Republicans, about three-in-ten Gen Zers (28%) say that society is not accepting enough of people who don’t identify as a man or woman, compared with 20% of Millennials, 15% of Gen Xers, 13% of Boomers and 11% of Silents. Democrats vary little by generation in shares holding this view. Gen Zers and Millennials are much more familiar than their elders with the idea that some people may prefer gender-neutral pronouns: 74% of Gen Zers and 69% of Millennials say they have heard “a lot” or “a little” about people preferring that others use gender-neutral pronouns such as “they” instead of “he” or “she” when referring to them, with about three-in-ten saying they have heard a lot about this. Most Gen Xers (62%) also have heard a lot or a little about people preferring gender-neutral pronouns. There is less awareness of this among older generations. Still, half of Boomers and 45% of Silents say they have heard at least a little about gender-neutral pronouns. Gen Zers are also the most likely among the five generations to say they personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns, with 35% saying so, compared with 25% of Millennials. Each of these younger generations is more likely than Gen Xers (16%), Boomers (12%) and Silents (7%) to say they personally know someone who prefers that others use gender-neutral pronouns when referring to them. This generational pattern is evident among both Democrats and Republicans. In addition to their greater familiarity with gender-neutral pronouns, Gen Zers and Millennials express somewhat higher levels of comfort with using gender-neutral pronouns, though generational differences on this question are more modest. Majorities of Gen Zers (57%) and Millennials (59%) say they would feel “very” or “somewhat” comfortable using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so, including about three-in-ten (32% of Gen Zers, 31% of Millennials) who say they would be very comfortable doing this. By comparison, Gen Xers and Boomers are evenly divided: About as many say they would feel at least somewhat comfortable (49% and 50%, respectively) as say they would be uncomfortable. Silents are the only group in which more say they would feel uncomfortable (59%) than say they would feel comfortable (39%) using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone. There are wide party gaps on this measure across generations. Within each generation, Democrats come down on the side of feeling comfortable, rather than uncomfortable, using a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to someone if asked to do so. In contrast, for each generation of Republicans, majorities say they would feel uncomfortable doing this. Across generations, knowing someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns is linked to comfort levels in using these pronouns. Three-quarters of Millennials and about two-thirds of Gen Zers, Gen Xers and Boomers who personally know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns say they would feel very or somewhat comfortable referring to someone with a gender-neutral pronoun. Those who don’t know someone are roughly 20 percentage points less likely to say the same (51% of Gen Zers, 54% of Millennials, 46% of Gen Xers and 48% of Boomers who don’t know someone say this).4 Fact Tank01/17/2019 Fact Tank11/28/2018 Fact Tank09/06/2018 Social Trends01/17/2019 U.S. Politics01/18/2019 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-419-4349 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

All market data delayed 20 minutes. The 2020 Democrat presidential candidates have served a combined 48 years in the Senate. They’ve served an additional 27 years in various mayoral offices and governor’s mansions across the country. Many things are changing across the globe. But because of the mainstream media’s myopic focus, we don’t have a very good understanding of what is happening abroad. Michael Cohen was supposed to provide "bombshell" testimony against President Trump. Well, the bombshell didn't explode. “Lanny Davis Productions.” That should have been the credit on this week’s big Michael Cohen drama. It’s a better fit than “House Oversight Committee.” Opioid-related deaths nationwide jumped four-fold in the last two decades, and the epidemic has made major inroads in the Eastern states, according to a new study by a U.S.- Canadian research team. They found that “the life expectancy lost at age 15 years from opioids is now greater than that lost from deaths due to firearms or motor vehicle crashes in most of the United States.” Why unrestricted recreational use of marijuana is a bad idea. What is literacy? We previously would have defined literacy using terms like reading, writing, speaking and listening and referenced the use of paper, pencils, books and telephones to communicate and disseminate information. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills this week that blame law-abiding gun owners for the actions of criminals and sociopaths. Over the course of their adolescence and early adult life, millennials have watched our political culture descend into tribalism, rancor, and partisan warfare. My wife of 10 years had just told me she had lost all feelings for me and had little hope that her feelings could be rekindled. The choice to vaccinate your children and whether you choose to or not doesn't make you a bad parent. Both sides are guilty of accusing the other as such, and it's unfortunate. Bottom line, parents on both sides of the debate are just looking to protect their children. Unfortunately, in all this, our children are becoming unprotected. Police arrested a suspect Friday in an attack on the University of California-Berkley campus against a volunteer for the conservative organization I head. This is very welcome news – violence against anyone for his or her political views must not be tolerated. Both former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and President Trump deserve serious praise for their clear condemnation of North Korea in the death of American college student Otto Warmbier. Latest opinion cartoons from FoxNews.com Trump didn't make a deal with North Korea, but no deal is better than a bad deal. And Michael Cohen told Congress he had no evidence of Russian collusion. With the Green New Deal the Democratic Party has dangerously endorsed a plan that amounts to nothing more than fantastical economic nonsense. Only a poor craftsman blames his tools, and that’s the trap the Democrats have fallen into. Instead of looking in the mirror and fixing their own deficiencies, they want to change the rules of the game to better suit their needs. President Trump’s decision to walk away from a bad deal with North Korea proves that his critics are clueless about how he conducts diplomacy.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-gag-order-book-amy-berman-jackson_n_5c7a08ece4b0e5e313ca8a63---split---Cagey political operative and Donald Trump pal Roger Stone is in trouble again with a federal judge — this time over the pending release of a book during a gag order she imposed before his upcoming trial. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Friday ordered Stone’s attorneys to explain by Monday why they waited to disclose the “imminent general release” of a book by Stone, which Jackson said “was known to the defendant.” The book could violate the gag order if it includes criticism of the judge or prosecutors with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The latest dustup comes just a week after the judge barred Stone from communicating publicly about his case after he posted a photo of Jackson’s face next to crosshairs on his Instagram account. The Instagram post also sought money for Stone’s legal defense and referred to Mueller as “Deep State Hitman Mueller.” The pending publication of the book was not mentioned when Jackson imposed the gag order then. The judge warned at the time that she had “serious doubts whether [Stone] learned any lesson at all” after his Instagram post — and said she would consider sending Stone to jail for future violations. The book was finally noted in the filing of a sealed motion Friday by Stone’s attorneys, Bloomberg reported. The judge’s brief ordered followed soon afterward. Stone, 66, is accused of lying to Congress and obstructing justice to hide his attempts to get information about plans to release hacked Democratic emails during the presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty. He announced in January on Instagram that he would be publishing the book “The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Trump Really Won.” A source told The Washington Post that the book was the same one Stone had written about the presidential campaign — with a new introduction. Stone said on Instagram earlier this month that the book would be published March 1. Stone was spotted on his way to a legal defense fundraiser Friday night in West Palm Beach. He refused to answer questions from a reporter about the congressional testimony Wednesday of Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen. Cohen testified that he heard Stone talk to Trump on a speaker phone about the hacked Democratic Party emails published by WikiLeaks. Stone’s trial is expected to last up to eight days, according to prosecutors. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) said on Friday that he will introduce a bill in the coming days to place the blame for the 2017 death of American college student Otto Warmbier squarely on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The congressman broke the news in a tweet, revealing that the bipartisan resolution would emerge next week to signify that Congress holds the ruler responsible: I’ll be introducing a bipartisan resolution next week affirming that Congress holds Kim Jong Un responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier. Malinowski’s announcement comes after President Donald Trump’s denial that Kim played any role in Warmbier’s death, which resulted from fatal injuries he sustained during his time imprisoned for several months in the country. “He tells me he didn’t know about it, and I take him at his word,” Trump declared on Thursday while ending his Hanoi, Vietnam, summit with Kim. The remark was delivered on the three-year anniversary of Warmbier’s taped plea for his release during which he made a tearful call for empathy from the country. By the time he was brought home, he was in a vegetative state and died shortly after his return. On Friday, the student’s parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, stood up to Trump’s rhetoric with a statement given to NBC News: Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that. Later that day, Trump took to Twitter to defend his comments, arguing they were “misinterpreted,” crediting himself for Warmbier’s release and adding that he “of course” believes North Korea is responsible, still avoiding pointing the finger at Kim.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/podcasts/daily-newsletter-green-book-michael-cohen.html---split---Supported by the daily newsletter Here’s why we just did. By Michael Barbaro [Want to get this by email? Here’s the sign-up.] When the producers of “The Daily” are in a room together, we inevitably turn to the shows and films we watch, albums and podcasts we listen to, plays we see, exhibitions we visit. But we almost never cover them on the show. Why is that? It’s something we debate a lot. In this moment of fractured media, what’s the place of pop culture on a news show — and on a news show meant to tackle a single topic that can be of interest to everyone? On any given day, we survey a vast world of news — political upheavals, congressional investigations, military conflicts — that seems to call out for the kind of illumination that we specialize in. And day after day, the crush of human drama unfolding on the ground seems to edge out the human drama reflected back to us by the world of art. A few days ago, there was an exception. The surprise victory of the movie “Green Book” at the Academy Awards on Sunday — and the emotional debate it touched off about race, history and how we tell the story of America — had an urgency that rivaled anything happening in the news. We just needed to find a way to tell it on “The Daily.” The obvious man for the job was Wesley Morris, a Times critic-at-large and co-host of the podcast “Still Processing,” whose brain is a wonder to watch in action. He pulls together ideas across time, history, culture. He makes art feel big and universal and essential. In our conversation, Wesley traced a 30-year history — starting with “The Toy” and “Driving Miss Daisy” — of what he called “racial reconciliation fantasies,” stories of racial harmony told through the eyes of white protagonists on a journey of discovery, with supporting black characters standing still. In these movies and TV shows, Wesley said, just being around a black person cured a white person of racism. These stories, he told us, are simplistic, flawed and ubiquitous — and one of them had just won best picture. Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb. 5G networks are upon us, and whichever country controls them will control a lot more than ultrafast internet. Spoiler: China may be close. Wesley Morris talks “Green Book,” Spike Lee and the “moral juiciness” of this year’s best-picture contest at the Oscars. A congressional race in North Carolina is tainted by election fraud — but not the kind that Republicans have been railing against. “He doesn’t want to be the leper of this story forever.” Maggie Haberman on Michael Cohen’s testimony against President Trump. Why the president came home from his second summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, empty-handed. After Tuesday’s episode, Ike Sriskandarajah — a “Daily” producer and longtime fan of the interracial buddy comedy genre (since “Trading Places”) — wanted to pose this question to Wesley Morris: What movies and TV shows actually get interracial relationships right? Wesley sent over this watch list, emphasizing that these aren’t perfect depictions of racial reconciliation, but are more honest portrayals of relationships between black and white characters than we typically see in our mainstream media. “Blue Collar” “Passion Fish” “30 Rock” “O.J.: Made in America” “Lethal Weapon 2” “Philadelphia” There aren’t many people who perk up at the sound of a congressional hearing, but “Daily” producer Rachel Quester is one. Here’s how she tackled Thursday’s episode: “As the self-appointed Washington news junkie of the team, I’ve had Michael Cohen’s testimony marked on my calendar since it was first announced. Here was a man who once said he’d take a bullet for Donald Trump. Now, he’s potentially the biggest legal threat against the president. I wanted to hear, in Cohen’s own words, what motivated such a dramatic shift. “Four of us hunkered down in a room with C-Span up on the big screen and a box of Dunkin’ doughnuts by our side (shoutout to Alex Young). We recorded the entire seven-hour hearing, time-stamping major moments along the way. Then we hurried into the studio to call Maggie Haberman, who, from her years of New York political reporting, knew all about the past lives of Cohen and Trump. “Our first draft of the episode came in at 47 minutes — two episodes’ worth of material. We’d built a scene with Republicans trying to call off the hearing before it began, and another about the fiery exchange between Rashida Tlaib and Mark Meadows. But in the end, we chose to focus on the story that we knew Maggie would have unique insight on: Cohen’s journey from being Trump’s pit bull to being the hangdog figure we saw that day.” For the biggest stories of our time, told by New York Times journalists each weekday, listen to “The Daily.” You can find it at nytimes.com/thedaily or wherever you get your podcasts.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/politics/senate-democrats-2020.html---split---Supported by By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders are convinced that Steve Bullock, the popular governor of Montana, would give the party its best shot at unseating Senator Steve Daines, a freshman Republican, when he stands for re-election next year in a state that President Trump carried by 20 points. But Mr. Bullock has a bigger — if far less attainable — aspiration: running for president. And so it has gone for Democratic leaders as they struggle to recruit a solid slate of candidates that they will need to net the three or four seats necessary to take control of the Senate next year. Four top-tier potential Democratic Senate candidates — John Hickenlooper in Colorado, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Beto O’Rourke in Texas and Mr. Bullock — are seriously exploring presidential campaigns, forsaking statewide campaigns within their grasp, at least for now, for a national one that would be the longest of long shots. A fifth potential recruit, Richard Ojeda, resigned his State Senate seat in West Virginia to run for president, only to withdraw last month — without committing to challenge Senator Shelley Moore Capito. “This isn’t a bad map like 2018 because we have very few seats to defend,” said Guy Cecil, the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “But the opportunities to pick up seats are limited, and we need the best candidates possible to win the majority. It’s critical that some of the long shots in the presidential primary consider the Senate this year.” Party leaders, guided by Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, the committee chairwoman, believe they need to nail down Mr. Bullock, and top recruits like him, if they have any chance of riding an anti-Trump wave to Senate control. But it hasn’t been easy. The Democratic Party’s bench is shallow in states that have been dominated by Republicans, like Georgia, Montana, North Carolina and Texas. It is rare for the party to have first-class candidates in such states, let alone talents like Ms. Abrams, Mr. Bullock and Mr. O’Rourke. And getting them to stay at home has proved nearly impossible. Mr. Bullock has told people around him that he has absolutely no intention of running for anything other than the White House, and is concerned about the strain on his family. His wife, Lisa Downs Bullock, a mathematician by training and mother of three, has told friends that she would relocate to Washington only if they were moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, according to two people familiar with their plans. “He’s got the skills to be a really good president,” said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana — sticking his buzz cut head out of a Senate elevator last week to make one final point. “But, you know, I think he’s got the skills to be a really good senator, too.” It is still early — Mr. Schumer, the Democratic leader, told Mr. Bullock last month, “you can always change your mind” if presidential aspirations do not pan out, according to aides briefed on the exchange. There is plenty of precedent for that. Successful Senate candidates have announced their intention to run as late as the summer before an election. Marco Rubio retired from the Senate to run for president in 2016, left retirement after that campaign fizzled and easily won re-election that fall. But for the coming Senate campaign, few years have been as unpredictable as 2020. The possibilities for Democrats range from a one-seat loss to a six-seat gain, according to pollsters and consultants working on races. That the Democrats are hosting the most crowded presidential casting call in a generation is not helping. The latest new wild card: Ms. Abrams, believed to have been considering a second run for governor of Georgia, is seriously examining a Senate or presidential campaign. She will make an announcement by mid-April, according to a person with direct knowledge of her planning. Revulsion toward Mr. Trump among the Democratic base led to a flood of House candidates last year, putting in play Republican House seats that Democrats had not sought in years. The same rage has produced 15 declared presidential candidates for 2020 so far. But that flood has yet to materialize in Senate races, which many recruits consider costly, exhausting and unglamorous. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Cortez Masto have had some victories. Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut who is married to former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, is challenging Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, who was appointed to the seat vacated after the death of John McCain. Mr. Schumer is confident that he will have a strong recruit to challenge Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been hugely popular in her state but is facing headwinds in a more partisan political environment. But they have had some failures. This week, Mr. O’Rourke let it be known that he would not challenge Senator John Cornyn next year in Texas, shrugging off Mr. Schumer’s dogged recruitment efforts. Public polling in recent days has indicated that Mr. O’Rourke was tied with Mr. Cornyn after his surprisingly narrow loss to Senator Ted Cruz in November. Internal polling by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee painted a less rosy picture, but Mr. Schumer went all out in pursuit of Mr. O’Rourke, even dispatching a close ally, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, to El Paso. Ms. Weingarten had a long conversation with Mr. O’Rourke and his wife about the seat, but the couple pretty much ruled out a Senate candidacy, according to people briefed on the exchange. In North Carolina, Democratic leaders have thus far been unable to sell a Senate run to the state’s attorney general, Josh Stein, who is Mr. Schumer’s top pick to challenge the incumbent, Senator Thom Tillis, a freshman. Mr. Stein would have the fund-raising prowess to compete in a race where expenditures by the candidates are likely to exceed $100 million. Mr. Hickenlooper, a former two-term Colorado governor with a centrist bent, would seem perfect to challenge Senator Cory Gardner, who might be the most endangered Republican up for re-election next year, in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But Mr. Hickenlooper, who is expected to announce his decision on a presidential run next week in Denver, has already turned down repeated entreaties by the Schumer and Cortez Masto team. They have enlisted Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, to keep pressuring Mr. Hickenlooper to lower his sights to a more realistic level. Likewise, Mr. Tester and other high-profile Democrats of Montana, including Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, have been prodding Mr. Bullock to reconsider. But the Senate is a tough sell for governors, who find it hard to go from running states to running legislative errands as freshmen, and it is an even tougher sell for Westerners who would have to endure long round-trip flights to Washington. Operatives close to Mr. Schumer and Ms. Cortez Masto view Mr. Hickenlooper as a soft “no” — in part because of Mr. Gardner’s vulnerability. That is exceeded only by Senator Doug Jones, the Democrat who triumphed in a special election in Alabama only after his opponent, Roy S. Moore, was accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls, according to recent polling. But Mr. Schumer has made it clear, through intermediaries, that Mr. Hickenlooper has less time to tarry than Mr. Bullock does. Two potentially well-funded candidates, Mike Johnston, a former state senator, and Andrew Romanoff, the former speaker of the Colorado House, have already entered the race, and others may soon follow. Ms. Cortez Masto and Mr. Schumer have adopted a tag-team approach. Ms. Cortez Masto patiently hears out potential candidates’ complaints and concerns, while Mr. Schumer hammers away at the fundamental political reality — namely, that each recruit has a much better chance of being elected to the Senate than the presidency. Mr. Schumer, forever tie-deep in party fund-raising, has become especially active this year. He has made it something of a personal project to persuade Ms. Abrams, who lost a bitter governor’s race last year, to challenge Senator David Perdue in his first re-election campaign. Mr. Schumer recruited Ms. Abrams to deliver a well-received rebuttal last month to Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address. The event demonstrated Ms. Abrams’s ease in front of a national audience, but also her political savvy: Her team placed the audience a few feet farther away than at most similar speeches, so that potential critics could not focus on the facial expressions of the crowd behind her. While Mr. Schumer’s appeals to Ms. Abrams have been more frequent, his partner’s one meeting with Ms. Abrams may have had a bigger effect. Ms. Cortez Masto spoke passionately about what it was like to be the first Hispanic woman elected to the Senate, which made a big impression on Ms. Abrams, according to a person close to her.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/trump-needs-to-weigh-in-now-on-north-carolina-special-election-former-rep-says---split---Former North Carolina Rep. Robert Pittenger urged President Donald Trump to weigh in on the special election primary in his old district. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Former Rep. Robert Pittenger, the most recent person to hold North Carolina’s vacant 9th District seat, urged President Donald Trump on Friday to help the GOP “coalesce” behind a someone by choosing his preferred primary candidate as early as possible. “The president does need to weigh in on this now,” Pittenger said in a radio interview Friday with WBT in Charlotte. If a dozen Republicans jump into the race and empty their campaign coffers in the primary for the chance to face the likely Democratic nominee, Dan McCready, that could prove a costly misallocation of resources in a district that Republicans feel they should win, the former three-term congressman said. Trump carried the 9th District by about 12 points in 2016. But the November midterm result that got thrown out last week was much closer — Republican Mark Harris led McCready by 905 votes. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the special election Toss-up. There is already a burgeoning field of prospective GOP candidates. “My hope and prayer is that Mr. Trump steps in and says, let’s coalesce behind this person,” Pittenger said. As the first special election after the 2018 midterms — when Democrats took back a majority in the House for the first time in eight years — Pittenger predicted that the special election in North Carolina’s 9th District will be a referendum on the president and his policies. “The whole country will be looking at this election,” Pittenger said. Pittenger left the House in January after losing his 2018 primary to Harris, a Baptist minister, who will not run in the special election after the North Carolina state board of elections threw out his November victory last week and ordered a new election. The board found that one of Harris’ campaign consultants may have swung the results of that election by running an illegal absentee ballot tampering scheme. The five-member board has not yet set dates for the primary and general elections in the 9th District. Simone Pathé contributed to this report.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/democrats-to-reintroduce-dream-act-with-tps-and-ded-protections-march-12---split---Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., will on March 12 reintroduce the Dream Act, a bill to provide a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The legislation will have some changes from prior versions. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) House Democrats on March 12 will reintroduce the Dream Act with new language providing protections for Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure recipients. California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard will reintroduce the measure — which provides permanent legal protections and a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children — as the Dream and Promise Act of 2019, according to her office. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reserved the bill number HR 6 for the legislation, which has long been a top priority of House Democrats. In 2017, Democrats filed a discharge petition to try to force a floor vote on the measure since Republican leaders wouldn’t bring it up, but the petition failed to get enough signatures. During the 2018 midterms, Pelosi promised Democrats would bring the Dream Act to the floor if they won the majority. Millions of Dreamers would benefit from the legislation, including the roughly 800,000 who have had legal protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. President Donald Trump has tried to end DACA, but federal courts have blocked him from doing so. During negotiations over border security funding earlier this year that resulted in the 35-day partial government shutdown, Trump floated a temporary extension of DACA funding in exchange for money for a border wall, but Democrats rejected the offer. DACA recipients have said they did not want their legal status traded for the wall. The rollout of Roybal-Allard’s legislation next month will also feature Pelosi and other party leaders along with New York Reps. Nydia M. Velázquez and Yvette D. Clarke, the other lead sponsors of the bill, according to Roybal-Allard’s office. Advocates are also likely to attend the rollout, as they’ve done for the introduction of House Democrats’ other top priority bills this Congress. The reintroduction of the Dream Act has taken longer than other measures simply reintroduced from the previous Congress because it will include changes from prior versions. Among those changes are the inclusion of protections for Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure recipients. TPS and DED offer protections from deportation for U.S. immigrants who can't return to their home countries due to a crisis, such as natural disaster, epidemic or civil war. Trump tried to terminate TPS for individuals from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador, but a federal court ruling has blocked him from doing so. DED protections for individuals from Liberia are scheduled to expire March 31. “TPS and DED protections are included because President Trump’s cruel and reckless actions have increased the urgency to address these issues and protect these individuals in our communities,” Roybal-Allard’s office said. The 2017 version of the Dream Act was bipartisan, but it’s unclear if any Republicans will sign on to the 2019 version. Two of the six of the Republican co-sponsors on the 2017 bill — Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Joe L. Barton of Texas — have retired and the other four — Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, and Jeff Denham and David Valadao of California — lost their re-election bids last fall.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/michael-j-fox-reveals-new-health-scare-amid-parkinsons-battle-blow-200213367.html---split---It’s been 20 years since Michael J. Fox publicly shared his Parkinson’s diagnosis and it’s a disease the actor has learned to live with and even “flourish in.” “I’d developed a relationship with Parkinson’s,” Fox said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine published Friday, “where I gave the disease its room to do what it needed to do and it left me areas I could still flourish in.” But his positive outlook was tested last year as the 57-year-old actor privately battled a new health issue. “I was having this recurring problem with my spinal cord. I was told it was benign but if it stayed static I would have diminished feeling in my legs and difficulty moving,” he shared. “Then all of a sudden I started falling — a lot. It was getting ridiculous.” Fox said he was “trying to parse what was the Parkinson’s and what was the spinal thing.” He continued, “But it came to the point where it was probably necessary to have surgery. So I had surgery, and an intense amount of physical therapy after. I did it all, and eventually people asked me to do some acting. Last August I was supposed to go to work. I woke up, walked into the kitchen to get breakfast, misstepped and I went down. I fractured the hell out of my arm. I ended up getting 19 pins and a plate. It was such a blow.” The Back to the Future star has tried to find some sort of meaning in the ordeal. “I try not to get too New Age-y. I don’t talk about things being ‘for a reason.’ But I do think the more unexpected something is, the more there is to learn from it,” he explained. “In my case, what was it that made me skip down the hallway to the kitchen thinking I was fine when I’d been in a wheelchair six months earlier? It’s because I had certain optimistic expectations of myself, and I’d had results to bear out those expectations, but I’d had failures too. And I hadn’t given the failures equal weight.” Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 1991, although he kept it private for seven years. “I was so scared,” he remembered. “I was so unfamiliar with Parkinson’s. Someone is saying your life is going to be completely changed. Yeah? When? I’m fine now but back then I wasn’t in the ‘I’m fine now.’ I was in the ‘I’m going to be bad.'” He continued, “That thinking didn’t allow me to trust that I could make a decision without worrying about time restrictions or financial pressures — which were inflated in my head. If I’d had any imperative to accomplish anything with movies, it shouldn’t have been to do as many quick successful ones as I could. It should’ve been to do as many good ones as I could. To do one good one. To find something that meant something to me.” He starred in a string of films — like Life with Mikey, For Love or Money and Where the Rivers Flow North — that never really hit. (Fox called his decision making around that time “ridiculous.”) In 1994, he started to really grasp what was happening. “I started getting it. That’s when I started to accept the disease — and acceptance doesn’t mean resignation. It means understanding and dealing straightforwardly. When I did Spin City, I started to do that,” he said of the hit series, which ran from 1996 to 2001. Fox shared that one of the reasons he left the show was due to the physical toll Parkinson’s began to take on his body. “I felt my face hardening. My movements were constricted. If you watch episodes from the last couple of seasons, you’ll see I would anchor myself against a desk or the wall,” he recalled. “Eventually it was too burdensome. So I left. After a couple of years I was asked to do Scrubs. I don’t think I was very good in it, but I enjoyed being back on set. Then I did Boston Legal — I remember the smell of the arclight while we shot. Something about that smell made me think, ‘Acting is what I do.’ And I needed to find a way to do it with my new instrument. Ultimately I found that the ‘less is more’ philosophy works for me. Which is convenient because I have less. More is more — I’d be out of business.” Although Fox is still acting, his passion lies in the foundation he started to combat Parkinson’s disease, which has raised $800 million. “I still believe in a cure. For so long Sinemet L-dopa [a medication used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms] was the gold standard,” he noted. “That was all we had, and it gave relief but it only lasted a certain amount of time and led to dyskinesias and other side-effects. So it was important to find better treatments.” He continued, “There’s a new drug that’s been approved that’s like a rescue inhaler for when you freeze. Because freezing is a very real thing for Parkinson’s patients. I could be sitting here with my foot on fire and a glass of water over there on the table and all I’d be able to do is think about how good it would feel to pour that water on my foot. Treatments for that can make a huge difference in people’s lives. Now, if we can prophylactically keep Parkinson’s symptoms from developing in a person, is that a cure? No. Would I take it? Yes.” Fox was asked if the Trump administration’s skepticism toward science has affected his foundation’s research. “We have a working relationship with the government. Trump is not sitting around thinking about Parkinson’s. But one thing that angered me is when he mocked that reporter,” he replied. At a 2015 campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump appeared to mock New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski who has the joint condition arthogryposis. “That was a stab to the guts. Not just for me, but for people I know and work with, who try so hard to overcome other people’s atavistic aversion to anybody that moves differently,” Fox recalled. “So I thought, Do I say something in response? Then I thought, People already know Trump is an [expletive].” Fox is currently working on a new book, which was inspired by last year’s scare. “My health issues last year brought me to places where I started to say, ‘Was it false hope I’d been selling? Is there a line beyond which there is no consolation?’ For me to get to that place is pretty dark,” he admitted. He continued, “I realized that the understanding I’d reached with Parkinson’s was sincere but risked being glib. I’d made peace with the disease but presumed others had that same relationship when they didn’t. Then when I started to deal with the effects from the spinal surgery, I realized: Wow, it can get a lot worse. Being in a position where I couldn’t walk and had health aides 24 hours a day, was I still prepared to say, ‘Hey, chin up!’ Parkinson’s, it’s a strange test.” Read more on Yahoo Entertainment: tom: The Gov of New York and many NY officials wrote an open letter to Amazon today, asking them to reconsider their Long Island City location.

Broadly speaking, people around the world agree that climate change poses a severe risk to their countries, according to a 26-nation survey conducted in the spring of 2018. In 13 of these countries, people name climate change as the top international threat. But global warming is just one of many concerns. Terrorism, specifically from the Islamic extremist group known as ISIS, and cyberattacks are also seen by many as major security threats. In eight of the countries surveyed, including Russia, France, Indonesia and Nigeria, ISIS is seen as the top threat. In four nations, including Japan and the United States, people see cyberattacks from other countries as their top international concern. One country, Poland, names Russia’s power and influence as its top threat, but few elsewhere say Russia is a major concern.  __ is a major threat to our country Note: “*” indicates the question was not asked in the country. Source: Spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey.  Many people also express fears about North Korea’s nuclear program, but in none of the 26 countries do people rate it as one of their top two concerns (even in neighboring South Korea). Fewer still rate the condition of the global economy as their top international concern, although it remains a pertinent issue in many countries, especially in places where ratings for the national economy are overwhelmingly negative, such as Greece and Brazil. And while a median of less than half across the nations in the survey say the influence of the U.S. is a major threat to their countries, more people now say it is a threat than in 2013 and 2017. Indeed, in 10 countries, roughly half or more now claim that American power is a major threat to their nation – including 64% who say this in Mexico, where ratings for the U.S. have turned sharply negative since the election of President Donald Trump. At the bottom of the threats list is China’s power and influence, although roughly half or more in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and the U.S. name China as a major threat. These are among the findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 27,612 respondents in 26 countries from May 14 to Aug. 12, 2018. There have been substantial changes over time on many of the eight international threats asked about in the 2018 survey. For example, in 2013, well before the Paris climate agreement was signed, a median of 56% across 23 countries surveyed said global climate change was a major threat to their country. That climbed to 63% in 2017, and in 2018 it stands at 67%. Since 2013, worries about the climate threat have increased significantly in 13 of the countries where data are available. The biggest increases have been in France (up 29 percentage points) and Mexico (up 28 points), but there have been double-digit rises in the U.S., UK, Germany, Spain, Kenya, Canada, South Africa and Poland as well. In 2013, a little less than half across the countries surveyed said North Korea’s nuclear program was a major threat (47%). But in 2018, a median of 55% name the issue as a major threat. Worries about the nuclear threat have risen substantially in many countries over the past five years, especially in the countries surveyed across Africa and Latin America. There has also been a substantial jump in those who see cyberattacks from other countries as a top threat. In 2018, a median of 61% across the countries see cyberthreats as a serious concern, up from 54% who said this in 2017. In the past few years there have been multiple headline-grabbing cybersecurity breaches in places as varied as the U.S., Japan and South Africa. Since 2017, there have been double-digit rises in those saying cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to their country in Tunisia (up 25 percentage points), the Netherlands (+15 points), Greece (+12), Sweden (+11) and Canada (+10). Meanwhile, there has been a decrease since 2017 in the number of countries that see ISIS as the top security threat. Substantial double-digit declines among those saying ISIS is a major threat occurred over the past year in Israel (down 16 points), Spain (-13), the U.S. (-12), Greece (-10) and Japan (-10). Views on the global economy and China as major threats have remained roughly the same since 2017. The largest change in sentiment among the global threats tracked are for those who see U.S. power and influence as a major threat to their countries. In 2013, only a quarter across 22 nations saw American power as a major threat to their country, but that jumped substantially to 38% in 2017, the year after Trump was elected president, and to 45% in 2018. In fact, in 18 of the 22 countries surveyed in both 2013, when Barack Obama was the U.S. president, and 2018, there has been a statistically significant increase in those who name the U.S. as a major threat. This includes increases of 30 percentage points in Germany, 29 points in France and 26 points in Brazil and Mexico. There is also a strong connection between seeing America as a threat and lack of confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump. In 17 of the countries surveyed, people who have little or no confidence in the U.S. president are more likely than those who do have confidence in Trump to name U.S. power and influence as a top threat. This difference is most acute among America’s traditional allies, such as Canada, the UK and Australia, where overall views of the U.S. and its president have plummeted in recent years. Across the 10 European countries surveyed, climate change and ISIS are clearly seen as major international threats, although a median of about half or more also name cyberattacks and North Korea’s nuclear program as top concerns. Russia’s power and influence is seen as a major threat by a median of four-in-ten across the continent, about the same share that sees U.S. power and influence as a threat (median of 37%). Meanwhile, only 35% see the condition of the global economy as a major threat, as European countries have mostly recovered from the Great Recession and subsequent euro crisis. A median of 31% see China as a major threat. In terms of individual nations surveyed within Europe, majorities in every country name climate change and ISIS as major threats to their countries. However, six of these countries offer climate change as the top concern, while only two name ISIS. In the Netherlands, more people say cyberattacks from other countries is the top threat, while in Poland, more say Russia’s power and influence is their major international concern. And while few across Europe say the condition of the global economy is a major threat to their country, 88% in Greece do. Despite some rising concerns about American power and influence, no more than half in any European country say U.S. power is a major threat, although nearly half hold this view in France (49%), Germany (49%) and Greece (48%). Since 2013, there has been a significant increase in the share naming climate change a major threat in seven of the European countries surveyed in both years. This includes a 29-percentage-point increase in France, an 18-point increase in the UK, 17 points in Spain and 15 points in Germany. There are some notable differences between American and Canadian views about the top threats facing their countries. Americans are chiefly concerned about cyberattacks, although majorities also see ISIS (62%), climate change (59%) and North Korea’s nuclear program (58%) as major threats. Since 2017, worries about ISIS are down 12 percentage points among Americans. By contrast, more Canadians say global climate change is a major threat to their country than say the same about cyberattacks (57%) or ISIS (54%). Cybersecurity has grown as a concern in Canada since 2017, when fewer than half (47%) said it was a major threat. Russians are relatively untroubled by cyberattacks from other countries (only 36% say it is a major threat) but are concerned about ISIS (62% major threat). Generally, Russians are among the least concerned about all the various threats tested in the survey relative to other countries. On a variety of threats, but especially on climate change and ISIS, there are sharp ideological and partisan divides in Europe and North America. For example, in the U.S., Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party are 56 percentage points less likely to believe that global climate change is a major threat to their country than are Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party. While this partisan divide is substantial, it is not unique. In Europe, supporters of some right-wing populist parties are less concerned than others about climate change. For instance, those with a favorable view of Alternative for Germany (AfD) are 28 percentage points less likely to say that climate change is a major threat to their country than those who do not support that party. Double-digit differences on this issue also appear between supporters and nonsupporters of UKIP in the UK, National Front (now National Rally) in France, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, and the Sweden Democrats in Sweden. There are also strong ideological divides on the threat perceptions of climate change and ISIS across Europe and North America. In nine of the 12 European and North American countries surveyed, those on the ideological left are more concerned about the threat of global climate change than those on the right. This is especially the case in the U.S., where nearly nine-in-ten (87%) among those on the left say global warming is a top concern, versus only 31% on the right who say this. Conversely, those on the political right in Europe and North America are often more concerned about ISIS than are those on the left. This includes ideological differences of more than 20 percentage points in the Netherlands, Canada, the U.S. and Sweden on the ISIS threat. A slight education divide on the threat of climate change exists in many European and North American countries surveyed, where those with more education are more inclined to say it is a threat than those with less education. In contrast to worries about climate change, in eight countries, those with less education are more likely to say ISIS is a major threat than their more-educated counterparts. Women in many countries surveyed are also more concerned about the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program than are men. Overall, double-digit differences between men and women on the North Korean threat appear in nine of the countries surveyed in Europe and North America, with the biggest gap in Sweden. In seven countries, women are more concerned about climate change than are men. In Poland, 61% of women name it as a major threat, compared with 48% of men. Women are also generally more worried than men about the ISIS threat (this is true in 10 countries in North America and Europe). On the risk posed by ISIS, there are significant age divides in many of the countries surveyed. For example, in Germany, 78% of those ages 50 and older are worried about the ISIS threat, compared with only 42% among 18- to 29-year-old Germans. Across the five Asia-Pacific countries surveyed, cyberattacks, climate change and ISIS are all mentioned as top concerns by at least one country. In Japan, it is cyberattacks, while in South Korea and Australia, it is climate change. ISIS is named as the top threat in the Philippines and Indonesia, nations where Islamic extremist violence has occurred frequently over the past 15 years. Asia-Pacific publics also express concern about North Korea’s nuclear program and China’s power and influence. In South Korea, more rate China’s power as a major threat (82%) than the DPRK’s nuclear program (67%). Since 2013, concern about North Korea has fallen substantially in South Korea, from 82% in 2013 to 67% in 2018. Over that time, perceptions of China as a threat have grown in four of the nations surveyed in the region, particularly in Australia (up 20 points) and Indonesia (up 16). Among the three Latin American countries surveyed, global climate change continues to rank as the top concern, extending an established trend. Eight-in-ten Mexicans say climate change is a major threat, marking an 8-percentage-point increase from 2017 and a 28-point increase since the question was first asked in 2013. Almost three-quarters of Argentines (73%) and Brazilians (72%) name climate change as a major threat. Education plays a significant role in how Latin American respondents evaluate the climate change threat. In Brazil, for example, more than eight-in-ten (84%) of those with a secondary education or higher say climate change is a major threat, compared with 62% of those with less education – a 22-point difference. Additionally, 85% of Brazilians in the ideological center are concerned about climate change, versus 74% of those on the left and 69% among the ideological right. Majorities in the Latin America region express significant concern about the condition of the global economy. More than six-in-ten in all three countries surveyed there name it a large threat, making it the second-highest concern in Argentina and Brazil and the third-highest in Mexico. Half or more of people in these nations also see North Korea’s nuclear program and cyberattacks from other countries as major threats. The three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed express distinct top concerns. ISIS stands out as the greatest threat in Nigeria, where the ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa have a strong presence. About six-in-ten (61%) categorize the group as a major concern, an 8-point increase since the question was first asked in 2016. In Kenya, where droughts and extreme weather events have negatively affected agriculture, the public feels most threatened by global climate change (71%). This is true across gender, age, income and education groups. Majorities also see ISIS, cyberattacks, the global economy and North Korea’s nuclear program as major threats.1 For South Africans, cyberattacks from abroad are considered most threatening; 61% categorize them as a large threat. Climate change closely follows as a significant concern, with roughly six-in-ten respondents (59%) naming it as a major threat. Education and income are linked to concern about climate change in South Africa: Those with more education or incomes higher than the median are more likely to see climate change as a major threat. Across the Middle Eastern, sub-Saharan African and Latin American countries surveyed, there are a variety of international concerns, but generally, climate change and ISIS are seen as top threats. In both Tunisia and Israel, ISIS is considered the top threat. Roughly eight-in-ten Tunisians (81%) see the militant Islamic group as a major threat. They are additionally apprehensive about the condition of the world economy, cyberattacks and climate change. About six-in-ten (61%) also say U.S. power and influence are a major threat to their country. Israelis also see ISIS as the top international threat among those tested. However, only 47% label it a major threat, illustrating Israel’s relatively low level of concern about all threat items tested. Roughly four-in-ten see cyberattacks (42%) and climate change (38%) as pressing threats. Jewish Israelis are more likely than the country’s Arabs to be worried about North Korea’s nuclear program, ISIS, cyberattacks from other countries and the condition of the global economy. On the other hand, Arabs are more likely to categorize U.S. power and influence as a large threat. Ideology also affects how Israelis perceive global threats. Israelis on the ideological right are more likely than those on the left to see North Korea’s nuclear program (42% vs. 21%) and ISIS (53% vs. 36%) as major threats. Those on the right are also less concerned about climate change (32% vs. 46%) and the condition of the global economy (35% vs. 49%) than are those on the left. Compared with concerns about Russian or Chinese influence, worries about U.S. power and influence are relatively high in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia. More than half in these countries say U.S. power is a major threat to their country. By comparison, concerns about the U.S. are relatively lower in sub-Saharan Africa and Israel. In none of these countries does a majority express concern about Russian or Chinese power. Apprehension about U.S. power has also increased over time in these countries. In Brazil, Mexico and Tunisia, concerns have gone up by more than 25 percentage points from 2013 to 2018. Worries have increased the least in Israel (up 6 points).

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-apologizes-michael-cohen_n_5c7a92d9e4b0614614da6a9a---split---Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) is backtracking on his personal threat to President Donald Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen, apologizing to the ex-attorney and admitting he crossed the line. “I want to say publicly what I’ve said privately to Michael Cohen and to his family, that I’m sorry if ― it is entirely appropriate to test the truthfulness of a witness, but that could have been done in a way that didn’t invoke someone’s family, and I shouldn’t have done it,” he told Fox News on Friday. Controversy unfolded Tuesday when Gaetz, in a now-deleted tweet that placed him under investigation by Florida’s bar association, insinuated that Cohen had a stash of paramours he kept hidden from his wife: Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot… “I made a mistake,” Gaetz conceded. “I should not have invoked someone’s family and I am here to take responsibility and to say that I’m sorry.” The lawmaker then slammed The Atlantic’s Eward-Isaac Dovere for claiming that Gaetz received a phone call from Trump to discuss Cohen’s testimony and his threat. Dovere reported the alleged detail in a tweet Thursday, writing that Gaetz could be heard telling Trump, “I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it.” President Trump called @mattgaetz last night from Hanoi to talk the Cohen testimony and the threats (since rescinded) Gaetz made about Cohen. "I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it," Gaetz was heard telling him. (Gaetz told me he doesn't discuss calls w/POTUS) Contrary to Dovere’s post, Gaetz said he was speaking with Florida Gov.

Does anything from Cohen’s disclosures on Wednesday threaten the future of his former boss’s presidency? Then, is a socialist from Vermont the candidate to beat in the 2020 Democratic primaries? Ross Douthat thinks Bernie Sanders’s path in 2020 could echo Ronald Reagan’s in 1980. Michelle explains the leftover antipathy that some Democratic voters still hold toward Sanders after the 2016 election. And David argues that despite the weaknesses of some of Sanders’s policies, his focus on economic populism puts him in the country’s political sweet spot. And finally, for those who aren’t yet tired of talking about socialism, the Soviet Union or the Oscars, Ross recommends Pawel Pawlikowski’s “Cold War.” Background Reading: David on impeaching President Trump and the pros and cons of Sanders 2020 Michelle on Cohen’s guilty plea, Cohen’s role in Trump’s legal jeopardy and what Democrats can do with subpoena power I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/rep-cummings-pens-accusatory-letter-white-house-council---split---Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., arrives to conduct the hearing featuring Michael Cohen, former attorney for President Donald Trump, in the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)  Maryland’s Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, sent a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on Friday accusing the administration of purposefully delaying the committee’s investigation into executive security clearances. “The White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the committee,” Cummings said. The letter was prompted by a Thursday New York Times report alleging that President Donald Trump lied to the paper in a January interview about his involvement in granting a security clearance to his son-in-law and senior presidential adviser Jared Kushner. “President Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House’s top lawyer,” the Times reported. According to the newspaper, John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff at the time, and Donald McGahn, the White House counsel, both wrote internal memos over their concerns about Kushner receiving the security clearance. Cummings wants to know why Trump overruled his advisers on the security clearance as well as what information officials obtained regarding Kushner that led to them initially denying him access to sensitive information. The Oversight chairman also wants to know why Kelly and McGahn felt compelled to pen memos, and why the counsel’s office is continuing to withhold documents and witness accounts from the committee. Cummings’ letter is the third, and final, message in an exchange between the Oversight Committee and Cipollone concerning breaches of national security in the White House. Cipollone was asked to respond to the letter by March 4. New York Democrat Adriano Espaillat introduced a bill in the House on Friday in a response to the Times story that amends the so-called Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. It would require congressional notification when individuals, who are not recommended by officials, are granted White House security clearance. Espaillat’s legislation is called the ‘Judgment And Responsibility in Executing Determinations for Security Clearance Act,’ or the ‘JARED Security Clearance Act of 2019.’ Also watch: Cohen vs. the GOP — the many defenses for Trump Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/things-go-boom-michael-cohen-apollo-11-week---split---Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, testifies Wednesday during a House Oversight and Reform hearing. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) There was so much political theater this week, it wouldn’t fit into just one podcast. So we did two! Michael Cohen, who will forever, at least to Political Theater, be the “Says who?” guy from the 2016 campaign, dropped in on Capitol Hill this week for a round robin of testimony with multiple committees about his fixer-for-Donald-Trump days. Sturm? Meet Drang.  So naturally we asked, what kind of political effect might this have on 2020 strategies. Bridget Bowman and Simone Pathé discuss in our first Political Theater podcast of the week. We kept it to the point, punchy even. Consider it a bonus podcast. And when you have crazy busy weeks like this one, it’s nice to zoom out. In the case of podcast No. 2, that takes us all the way to the moon and back, with Todd Douglas Miller hanging out and discussing his new documentary, “Apollo 11,” which he put together using never-before-seen archival footage, a lot of it in 65mm large film format, from that seminal moment in human history. Yet another look at a 50-year-old event might seem not the best investment of time. But don’t be fooled. Miller’s sveltely edited movie presents the lunar mission in a fresh way, bringing viewers into a story that feels both intimate, as it zooms in on the small details of late 1960s American life, and epic, as the images and narrative move into the celestial phase and back to Earth. Even lawmakers should geek out about it. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who attended the screening of “Apollo 11” on Tuesday night at the Air and Space Museum, certainly did, snapping pics with his phone of the Apollo launch, which shook the theater and led Eric Armstrong, son of the late Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong, to say the movie was the closest thing to an actual Saturn V rocket launch he’d ever seen. What else this week? Oh, there was the House voting to terminate the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump invoked to build a wall on the southern border. Several Republicans crossed the aisle to support that, although it fell short of a veto-proof majority, and Trump says he will most definitely veto it if it gets to his desk. In the event the declaration holds and the president is able to raid appropriated money from military installations and counter-narcotics programs for his pet project, the Pentagon wants Congress to replenish the funds with most haste. The House also passed, for the first time in years, stand-alone gun safety legislation. There was some aisle-crossing on that one, too. Speaking of guns! Capitol Police officers are at the whole did-I-really-leave-my-service-weapon-in-the-bathroom-thing again. No really. A cop left his Glock in a Capitol Visitor Center bathroom. Again. The Senate confirmed a circuit court judge, tearing up the traditional blue slip process of allowing home-state senators to weigh in on the choice. The majority is not about to let a few decades’ worth of precedence and courtesy to get in the way of filling the judiciary with Trump’s conservative-stamped nominees.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chris-wallace-jared-kushner-cia_n_5c79b8f5e4b0614614da0d60---split---Fox News’ Chris Wallace raised a question Friday about why the CIA and White House officials were reportedly dead-set against granting top security clearance to Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump. “You have to ask yourself ... what was it that these people were so concerned about?” Wallace asked (see the video above at 9:10). The Fox News host addressed the issue on “Shepard Smith Reporting” the day after The New York Times reported that Trump had dismissed concerns about Kushner and demanded last May that the White House senior adviser be given top-secret clearance — over the objection of intelligence agencies. John Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, was so infuriated that he wrote an internal memo stating he had been “ordered” to grant the clearance, sources told the Times. Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have insisted that the president had nothing to do with Kushner’s clearance. Security officials, Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn were determined to continue to oppose “something they knew the president wasn’t going to like — refusing to give a top-security clearance to Jared Kushner,” said Wallace. The Times report did not reveal the specific nature of the officials’ concerns. Some observers believe Kushner’s multiple international business interests and unreported contacts with foreign agents triggered worries about risks to the nation’s most sensitive security information. Both White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway said they couldn’t comment on security issues. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) complained Friday that the White House has repeatedly denied the House oversight committee’s requests for documents concerning Kushner’s clearance. Cummings wrote in a letter Friday to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that if the Times reports are true, they “raise grave questions about what derogatory information ... [was] obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation’s most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role ... and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-panel-kushner-clearance-records_n_5c79ed35e4b0e1f776519ee1---split---WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - A Democratic-led congressional panel on Friday demanded that the White House comply with requests for documents and witnesses for a probe into alleged security clearance abuses involving President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and others. After weeks of White House stonewalling, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, in a letter to the White House, said “I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation.” Cummings panel has subpoena power. Cummings highlighted in his letter a New York Times story that said Trump ordered his former chief of staff John Kelly to provide Kushner with clearance over objections from Kelly and Donald McGahn, then White House counsel. The Times said Kelly and McGahn both wrote memos about the incident and that McGahn outlined concerns raised about Kushner by career security officials, including CIA officers. “If true, these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr.Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation’s most sensitive secrets,” Cummings wrote to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in the March 1 letter, which appeared to set the stage for his committee to subpoena the material. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Oversight Committee launched its investigation on Jan 23. Cummings said he and his staff have since written and spoken to White House officials multiple times about obtaining documents and witnesses, but to no avail. Kushner’s temporary clearance was suspended by Kelly in February 2018, along with other officials operating under temporary clearances, as part of measures to tighten procedures after White House staff secretary Rob Porter was fired when his two ex-wives raised charges of domestic abuse. Cummings said he has provided the White House with detailed descriptions of security clearance abuses by at least nine high-level White House officials including Kushner and current and former national security advisers. The House Democrat’s letter included a transcript from a Jan. 31 Times interview with Trump, in which the president denied ordering Kelly to overrule security officials and provide clearances for Kushner. Trump said he did not think he had the authority to overrule security officials on clearance matters, according to the letter. But White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told an NBC interviewer on Friday that Trump has said he has “absolute authority” to order security clearances. Cummings gave the White House until Monday to respond to his latest demands. His panel’s probe is part of a wide-ranging effort by House of Representatives Democrats, launched since they took majority control of the chamber in January, to investigate Trump, his presidency and his business interests.

Por GRETCHEN REYNOLDS El presidente de Estados Unidos ha mostrado simpatía por líderes autoritarios en el mundo. Pero una de las excepciones es Nicolás Maduro, el mandatario de Venezuela. ¿Es el único autócrata que no respeta?

En este espacio compartiremos decisiones de estilo que tomamos en The New York Times en Español y recomendaciones para escribir en nuestra lengua. Por PAULINA CHAVIRA Lucía pidió la interrupción de un embarazo resultado de una violación, pero le fue negada y tuvo que someterse a una cesárea; su caso es un nuevo ejemplo de las restricciones que sufren las argentinas para decidir sobre sus propios cuerpos. Por DANIEL POLITI Esta semana en El Espace: los Premios Oscar con el cine de Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro y Alejandro González Iñárritu, la expansión de la moda “chola” y los chicanos en Japón.

Por DENNIS OVERBYE "Capitana Marvel” es la primera adaptación de la empresa de cómics con una protagonista, pese a que la imprenta tiene varios títulos con mujeres en el centro. ¿Por qué tardó tanto tiempo en llevarlas a la pantalla? ¿Le rendirá frutos hacerlo? Por DAVE ITZKOFF A semanas de la elección en la que está postulado, el político israelí fue acusado de sobornos, fraude y abuso de confianza tras una investigación de dos años de la fiscalía. Si aun así consiguiera reelegirse, es poco probable que logre una coalición para gobernar. Por DAVID M.

El programa fue celebrado por activistas y repudiado por padres de familia.

Si triunfa habrá ganado cinco copas seguidas, cosa que no hizo nunca nadie. Por MARTÍN CAPARRÓS La adolescente es considerada el máximo prodigio del futbol estadounidense y, en una muestra del mayor perfil de las ramas femeninas y del interés en estas, ya anunció sus intenciones profesionales y obtuvo el patrocinio comercial. Por ANDREW KEH Cuando el gobierno de la isla convocó a la ciudadanía a un referendo constitucional —cuyo resultado era predecible—, no pudo prever el debate que se dio en la sociedad civil, inédito en casi medio siglo de adoctrinamiento totalitario.

Por THE NEW YORK TIMES Te presentamos pequeños cambios en tu vida cotidiana que pueden hacer una gran diferencia para conservar a nuestro planeta. Además, te ayudarán a ahorrar dinero. Por JAMES K.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cpac-matt-schlapp-chris-cuomo-trump_n_5c7a63b8e4b0e1f77651c742---split---Conservative Political Action Conference chair Matt Schlapp dismissed concerns on Friday over President Donald Trump’s statements doubting the North Korean regime’s responsibility for Otto Warmbier’s death. Speaking to CNN’s Chris Cuomo the Maryland conference site, Schlapp delivered an emphatic defense of the president after the anchor accused Trump of making “a mockery of political discourse, decency and truth-telling.” “I don’t know that,” Schlapp claimed. “I think it’s a big mistake to say that Donald Trump is somehow a dishonest political leader.” But Cuomo wasn’t having it, pointing out that Trump “lies all the time” from hush money payments to porn stars to his alleged role in ensuring son-in-law Jared Kushner’s security clearance. Now, Trump has expressed trust in his third despot, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Previously, he’s shown support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial of election meddling and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s claim that he had nothing to do with the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. CPAC chairman: Don't call [President Trump] a liar Conservative Political Action Conference Chairman Matt Schlapp denies claims that President Trump consistently does not tell the truth. pic.twitter.com/dUz39ZiRsN Still, Schlapp contended that the media was simply too fixated on the inaccuracies. “I know that there are certain outlets that want to focus on things that they say some truth-teller says is incorrect,” he said. “The president was very clear with the American voter about what he intended to do. He wasn’t lying about what he intended to do, Chris, and what he has done is to put into place what he said he would do. What you are all obsessed with is the inaccuracies that some people say exist along the way.” CPAC, which kicked off Wednesday and ends Saturday, is an annual gathering of Republicans and far-right activists featuring speeches from GOP lawmakers and cable news giants.
---split---7.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/business/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-amazon-hollywood.html---split---Supported by By Amy Chozick Jeff Bezos amassed the world’s greatest fortune by relying on what he has called a “regret minimization framework.” He built an $800 billion company with 14 codified principles and a brutally exacting culture. His annual salary of $81,840 has not budged since 1998. But then Mr. Bezos went to Hollywood. In the weeks since the Amazon founder tweeted that he and his wife of 25 years were divorcing, he has gone to war with a grocery store tabloid and escalated a conflict with the president of the United States. And he has essentially ceded control of his own narrative to two rogue characters: a swashbuckling A-list security consultant, Gavin de Becker, and his girlfriend’s fame-hungry brother-manager, Michael Sanchez. Locked in a feud, the two are prolonging the scandal’s news value almost daily. Mr. Bezos is at the center of an honest-to-God melodrama, full of salacious revelations, family betrayals and international intrigue. In Seattle, Amazon’s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, the former White House press secretary Jay Carney, has recently tried to get the story back under control. But in Hollywood, the swirl around Mr. Bezos’s love life refuses to be contained, churning through an ecosystem of gossip and favors, where dish on the rich and powerful is currency. Amazon executives were blindsided by a sequence of events that began in early January: the announcement by Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos of their divorce; the 11-page National Enquirer exposé that Mr. Bezos was romantically involved with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor; a sensational blog post by Mr. Bezos accusing the head of the tabloid, an ally of President Trump, of attempting to extort him over a “below-the-belt selfie” and other sexts. It has not helped matters that the intimate details of Mr. Bezos’s personal life emerged around the same time that the company abruptly canceled its plans to build a new headquarters in New York, after fighting with lawmakers and activists. People who have worked closely with Mr. Bezos have watched dumbfounded that a man famous for being a vault of discretion could end up, as one of them put it, in the middle of such a “clown show.” For advice on the crisis, Mr. Bezos has relied almost entirely on Mr. de Becker, who in addition to providing security to stars is something of a celebrity himself. He once protected Cher, and he delivered a eulogy at the memorial of his friend Carrie Fisher. His book, “The Gift of Fear,” was a megahit — Oprah Winfrey backed it — and reads like a TED Talk for the rich and afraid. Mr. de Becker is employed by Mr. Bezos, not Amazon, and appears to be hardly in touch with strategists at the company. Adding to the cast, Mr. de Becker has enlisted the famed law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, as well as Marty Singer, a notorious Los Angeles litigator who has represented John Travolta and Sharon Stone, to work the media. Ms. Sanchez has consulted the Los Angeles divorce maestro Laura Wasser, who has counted Kim Kardashian West and Angelina Jolie as clients. Also in the mix is Ms. Sanchez’s estranged husband, Patrick Whitesell, who as the executive chairman of Endeavor is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood. His business partner at the agency is the operatically colorful macher Ari Emanuel, and they know more than almost anyone about how to use tabloid ink to boost a client or break a competitor. After the affair broke into the open, it didn’t take long for Mr. Whitesell to be spotted by TMZ leaving a nightclub with a 20-something model. Her surname? Alexa. The loosest cannon of them all may be Michael Sanchez. Ms. Sanchez’s brother is a scrappy agent to a roster of reality TV personalities and an incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them. He is also a supporter of Mr. Trump, and has relationships with some of his operatives, including Roger Stone and Carter Page. Mr. Sanchez is in regular touch with an expanding list of reporters around the country, and is constantly supplying them with fresh innuendo on the Bezos drama. Mr. Sanchez alleges that Mr. de Becker is trying to keep his sister away from Mr. Bezos, in hopes of keeping the Bezos marriage intact. “Gavin has brilliantly set you and I up with the clear goal of destroying your love for my sister,” Mr. Sanchez wrote in an email to Mr. Bezos on Valentine’s Day, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. “I know the truth about your love for Lauren and her love for you.” Four people with direct knowledge of the siblings’ relationship said that Ms. Sanchez is no longer speaking to her brother. Mr. Sanchez disputed this, and Ms. Sanchez declined to comment. In February, The Daily Beast reported that Mr. de Becker had completed an investigation into who initially leaked the texts, and that Mr. Sanchez provided The Enquirer with its exclusive on Mr. Bezos’s affair. In an interview, Mr. Sanchez told me he did talk to the tabloid about his sister’s relationship (in an effort to help her), but denied sending it Mr. Bezos’s sexts, which he said he didn’t have access to. He theorized that The Enquirer had obtained the images via a Beverly Hills socialite who had gotten them directly from his sister. I explained to two people with direct knowledge of The Enquirer’s reporting what Mr. Sanchez told me: that he’d provided some details of the affair to the tabloid, but not the sexts. These people, who would talk only about private conversations without attribution, emphasized that everything The Enquirer received on the Bezos affair, including the “below-the-belt selfie,” came from a single source. These people added that the source was compensated by The Enquirer. How much? An amount well above the $150,000 that the tabloid paid the former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump ahead of the 2016 election, they said. For years, Mr. Bezos did not seem like the kind of chief executive who craved rock-star status. He didn’t employ a personal publicist to help bolster the Bezos myth, because he didn’t need to. The sheer reach of his company did the mythmaking for him: Amazon has transformed the way we read, shop and watch TV, and through its cloud services division runs an astonishingly large portion of the internet. Even as the company’s power grew, Mr. Bezos made a point of directing focus to the customer, who he said occupied “the empty chair” in every meeting. Mr. Bezos bought a home in Beverly Hills in 2007, as Amazon was beginning to expand into entertainment. The company does not break out the financials of its Hollywood business, but it has been spending furiously to build a TV and film portfolio that enriches its Prime offering. Subscription services brought in more than $14 billion last year. To Hollywood insiders, the gusher of cash turned Mr. Bezos into the object of fascination and fear. As Amazon bulldozed its way into the industry, Mr. Bezos transformed from a low-key, geeky Seattle dad to a chiseled presence on the red carpet. He has never seemed to be enthralled with the filmmaking process — he leaves day-to-day management to the Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke — but like Howard Hughes and other outsider tycoons before him, Mr. Bezos has unmistakably embraced the industry’s trappings. His true Hollywood coming out was in 2016, when he gave a party — lavish even in the context of awards season — to celebrate the Oscar favorite “Manchester by the Sea,” an Amazon Studios production. Matt Damon was the co-host. It was held in a temporary edifice (only in Beverly Hills could it be called a “tent”) perched at the end of the long, pebbled driveway at Mr. Bezos’s mansion, high above Sunset Boulevard. The evening appears to be the first time that he and Ms. Sanchez were publicly photographed together. They had met the previous year. As Amazon pushed into entertainment, it often worked with Endeavor, and Mr. Whitesell and Ms. Sanchez started socializing with the Bezoses. Their children played together at the Bezos family’s 29,000-square-foot compound outside Seattle, sprinting around a room decorated with NASA memorabilia and a chair in which J.K. Rowling wrote parts of the “Harry Potter” books. (It sold at auction for $394,000.) Ms. Sanchez, an aviation enthusiast with a helicopter license, talked shop with Mr. Bezos, who spends much of his time building Blue Origin, his space exploration company. The two went flying together — encouraged by Mr. Whitesell, who saw the socializing as good for his wife’s aerial film and production company, Black Ops Aviation. By last year, they were having an affair. Three people in Ms. Sanchez’s extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms. At Amazon, Mr. Bezos has long implemented an idiosyncratic meeting structure. Executives sit in silence, reading a six-page memo on the topic at hand. Bullet points are frowned upon; the document must be a cogent narrative. Only once everyone has digested the “six-pager” do discussions begin. That process may have been what Mr. Bezos was channeling when — without consulting Amazon brass — he published an explosive Medium essay on Feb. 7 accusing The Enquirer of extortion and blackmail. The tabloid was threatening to publish photos it had obtained, including one of Mr. Bezos’s “semi-erect manhood,” unless he met their conditions. Mr. Bezos called out David Pecker, the chief executive of The Enquirer’s parent company, American Media, who has been known to wield his influence to benefit Mr. Trump. (Last year, federal prosecutors determined that American Media had made illegal payments to silence women who said they had had affairs with Mr. Trump.) Mr. Bezos added that he had asked Mr. de Becker to conduct an investigation into how the tabloid had gotten his texts and photos. He implied that Mr. Trump and the Saudi royal family’s displeasure with The Washington Post, which he owns, were behind The Enquirer’s actions. When Mr. Bezos published his essay, commentators were nearly unanimous in hailing it as a public relations masterstroke: Somehow, the world’s richest man, caught cheating on his wife, was now a victim. But since then, more than three weeks have elapsed, and while Mr. de Becker has told The Washington Post that the Enquirer piece was “politically motivated,” direct proof of the Trump or Saudi links has not yet emerged. Asked repeatedly for such evidence, Mr. de Becker, who was traveling in Fiji, declined to comment on the record. A person in Mr. Bezos’s camp, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the investigation into the Enquirer story had moved beyond Mr. Sanchez, and to some extent was out of Mr. de Becker’s hands, now that evidence was with law enforcement. Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez remain together. On Feb. 19, Mr. Bezos spoke at the Yale Club in New York about his plan to populate the solar system with 1 trillion people through Blue Origin. “I try to organize my personal time so that I live mostly about two to three years out,” Mr. Bezos said, according to a transcript published on Business Insider. The New York Post elected to ignore the space-travel angle, reporting instead that he and Ms. Sanchez had been holed up in a Park Avenue “luxe love nest.” So far, investors haven’t minded the messiness of Mr. Bezos’s personal life and his pull toward Hollywood. Amazon’s share price is up since the start of the year, and the company said that Mr. Bezos had not been distracted by the scandal. “Jeff remains as intensely focused on Amazon’s various businesses as ever, running daylong meetings of the S-Team (our leadership team) and daily forwarding emails he receives from customers to business leaders,” Mr. Carney wrote in an email. Still, the incidents have left many adherents to the Bezos Way — who are legion — confused about what the events of the past several weeks say about Mr. Bezos’s judgment. One former Amazon executive, who signed a nondisclosure agreement and could only discuss the company anonymously, wondered how Mr. Bezos’s behavior squared with a recent letter he sent to shareholders, in which he talked about irrevocable decisions, or what he called “one-way doors.” “These decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly and with great deliberation and consultation,” Mr. Bezos said. “If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before.” Brooks Barnes and Karen Weise contributed reporting.

Getty Images hide caption President Trump attends a news conference following his summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Thursday. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) is a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and author of a novel about how a nuclear war with North Korea might begin, The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States. A bipartisan consensus seems to be forming that President Trump was right to walk away from the deal offered by Kim Jong Un at the two leaders' summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. The consensus is a strange one, given that the deal itself was exactly the same as what had been reported to be North Korea's position heading into the negotiation, a position that many commentators had praised. North Korea would offer to shut down facilities at its Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center that were involved in making plutonium and highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. In exchange, North Korea asked the United States to lift sanctions that had been imposed on its civilian economy since 2016. The U.S. position — that North Korea must unilaterally abandon its nuclear capabilities in exchange for promises of some different future — is a kind of American fantasy about power that is more suited to an action movie than the reality of international negotiations. Jeffrey Lewis, Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey Of course, North Korea would retain its nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and many other facilities after such an agreement. And the United States and other countries would also retain many sanctions on North Korea. The agreement on offer was hardly the disarmament that the president had hoped for, but it would have been another step away from the taunts and threats of 2017 and toward some other future. That was the deal the U.S. should have taken. For the North Koreans, the logic of the offer was obvious. The United Nations had tightened existing sanctions in 2016 in response to a series of tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. North Korea has now stopped such tests, closed its nuclear test site, partially dismantled a rocket-engine test stand and offered to dismantle some of the facilities at Yongbyon. Surely an adjustment in sanctions was warranted. Trump and his team disagreed. One State Department official explained that North Korea must not merely end testing but also give up all the weapons developed on the basis of those tests. "Testing was part of a process of developing nuclear weapons, and the weapons themselves need to be on the table," the official explained. "It's not the testing of the weapons; it's the actual presence of the nuclear weapons — and, by the way, likewise in the case of missile testing, the ICBMs as well that are central to this discussion." The U.S. position — that North Korea must unilaterally abandon its nuclear capabilities in exchange for promises of some different future — is a kind of American fantasy about power that is more suited to an action movie than the reality of international negotiations. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump, shown in a handout photo provided by the Vietnam News Agency, meet at the Sofitel Legend Metropole hotel on Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam. Handout/Getty Images hide caption North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump, shown in a handout photo provided by the Vietnam News Agency, meet at the Sofitel Legend Metropole hotel on Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam. Let's be clear: During 2017, North Korea tested a series of new missiles, including two different intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that can reach the United States. One of those missiles, the Hwasong-15, can deliver a nuclear-weapon-size payload all the way to Mar-a-Lago. Like a gambler racking up debt, the U.S. foreign policy community has consistently taken its chances at the roulette table rather than cutting its losses and admitting the obvious: North Korea has the bomb. Jeffrey Lewis, Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey North Korea also tested a thermonuclear weapon that exploded with a force 10 times stronger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By any measure, North Korea's leverage over the course of 2017 increased dramatically as it acquired the ability to grievously harm the United States. We can be angry about this, but our rage is impotent. Attempting to remove Kim from power as we did with Saddam Hussein or Moammar Gadhafi would be sheer madness. And so, why would the United States expect North Korea to willingly trade away that advantage in its entirety? Why would North Korea, having completed the development of a nuclear deterrent that puts it in a class with countries like China, India, Pakistan and Israel, simply apologize and turn over these capabilities in exchange for a couple of McDonald's and a Trump Tower Pyongyang? It is obvious, or it should be, that North Korea has a strong hand to play. Why is that so hard to see from inside the Beltway? I suspect that part of the problem has to do with a kind of embarrassment. Time and again, the United States has walked away from diplomatic agreements with North Korea. In fairness, the North Koreans have been no angels. But the U.S. has seldom stuck around long enough to work through the difficulties and differences. Each time, North Korea has increased its nuclear capability. In 2002, the United States walked away from the 1994 Agreed Framework that froze North Korea's plutonium production, only to see North Korea conduct its first nuclear test in 2006. The United States tried again but abandoned Six-Party Talks in 2008 over concerns about verification, only to watch North Korea conduct more nuclear tests. And in 2012, the U.S. walked away from another tentative deal over a North Korean rocket launch, only to see Pyongyang spend the past few years testing ever more weapons, including its ICBM and thermonuclear weapon to arm it. Each time the United States walked, a lot of people in Washington promised that patience and pressure would produce a better deal than the one squandered. And each time they were wrong. Like a gambler racking up debt, the U.S. foreign policy community has consistently taken its chances at the roulette table rather than cutting its losses and admitting the obvious: North Korea has the bomb. But that's apparently the one thing that remains taboo in Washington. Even now, the United States cannot recognize what seems pretty obvious. We can't admit failure because it requires not merely changing our policy but admitting that we've been wrong. It's far easier to pretend that a better deal is just around the corner. It isn't.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/khizr-khan-trump-otto-warmbier_n_5c7a5a5ae4b0e5e313caa931---split---Gold Star father and Muslim-American Khizr Khan, who made a name for himself standing up to President Donald Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric and criticism of his family, slammed the commander in chief’s seesawing on North Korea’s responsibility for the death of Otto Warmbier. “He has disappointed the nation,” Khan told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in an interview Friday, rebuking the president’s lack of sympathy for the American college student who died after being imprisoned under dictator Kim Jong Un’s regime. “Basically, the element of that empathy is missing and without that, we will continue to go through this ordeal whatever time is left, whatever time we have to endure” with Trump in the Oval Office. "I am disappointed, it doesn't surprise." Gold Star Father Khizr Khan on what @AndersonCooper calls the "sheer number of lies" in the Trump presidency. "It was so obvious that this nation is being conned ... something that wasn't there was being sold."https://t.co/bVbqZyOqXw pic.twitter.com/HkiUDN2N2y Closing his summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, with Kim on Thursday where no nuclear deal was reached, Trump said the dictator had told him he was unaware of how Warmbier was fatally injured in 2017 and that he took Kim “at his word.” Having made himself the target of bipartisan criticism, by Friday, Trump defended his statements, tweeting that he had been “misinterpreted” and that he “of course” held North Korea responsible. However, the seemingly endless parade of scandals and White House chaos under Trump’s administration wasn’t a shock to Khan. “It was so obvious that this nation is being conned, is being misled, misguided, something that wasn’t there was being sold and the nation is finding out,” he said. “The disappointing part is that our Republican leaders, members of the Congress, they have forgotten their leadership, they have forgotten what their obligations are to the Constitution, to our democracy, to the rule of law.” Khan made headlines at the Philadelphia Democratic National Convention in 2016 where he gave a speech in remembrance of his son and Army captain, Humayun Khan, who was killed in a 2004 Iraq car bombing while attempting to rescue other troops. Juxtaposing the story with Trump’s anti-Muslim smears, Khan then created a famous moment when he raised up a pocket-sized Constitution before the audience, asking the then-presidential candidate if he had bothered to read it. Since Trump’s rise, Khan has become even more politically outspoken against the president. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

---split---8.0---split---https://play.google.com/?hl=en---split---#1 New York Times Bestseller Over 2 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie. As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore. With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be. With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, Girl, Wash Your Face shows you how to live with passion and hustle--and how to give yourself grace without giving up. The Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller! This program is read by the author. On March 16, 2018, just twenty-six hours before his scheduled retirement from the organization he had served with distinction for more than two decades, Andrew G. McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy." In The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution. McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime—which is inextricably linked to the Russian state—and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The Threat recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen. Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, The Threat tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America. New York Times Bestseller Joining the ranks of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, You Are a Badass, and F*ck Feelings comes this refreshing, BS-free, self-empowerment guide that offers an honest, no-nonsense, tough-love approach to help you move past self-imposed limitations. Are you tired of feeling fu*ked up? If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unfu*ked version of yourself. "Wake up to the miracle you are," he directs. "Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being." It isn't other people that are standing in your way, it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive, it's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. In Unfu*k Yourself, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: Lead the life you were meant to have—Unfu*k Yourself. Simple ideas, lasting love.

"Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter 'H'." Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire...not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn’t bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She’s the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England. Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past? Only the devil’s daughter knows…  Shadow dreamed of nothing but leaving prison and starting a new life. But the day before his release, his wife and best friend are killed in an accident. On the plane home to the funeral, he meets Mr. Wednesday—a beguiling stranger who seems to know everything about him. A trickster and rogue, Mr. Wednesday offers Shadow a job as his bodyguard. With nowhere left to go, Shadow accepts, and soon learns that his role in Mr. Wednesday’s schemes will be far more dangerous and dark than he could have ever imagined.

For years, Maggie Sheets has been an invisible hand in the glittering homes of wealthy New York City clients, scrubbing, dusting, mopping, and doing all she can to keep her head above water as a single mother. Everything changes when a former employer dies leaving Maggie a staggering inheritance. A house in Sag Harbor. The catch? It comes with an inhabitant: The deceased’s eighty-two-year old mother Edith. Edith has Alzheimer’s—or so the doctors tell her—but she remembers exactly how her daughter Liza could light up a room, or bring dark clouds in her wake. And now Liza’s gone, by her own hand, and Edith has been left—like a chaise or strand of pearls—to a poorly dressed young woman with a toddler in tow. Maggie and Edith are both certain this arrangement will be an utter disaster. But as summer days wane, a tenuous bond forms, and Edith, who feels the urgency of her diagnosis, shares a secret that she’s held close for five decades, launching Maggie on a mission that might just lead them each to what they are looking for.

Adoptive daughter of a gifted scientist, Foster Stewart doesn’t live a “normal” life, (not that she’d want to). But controlling cloud formations and seeing airwaves aren’t things most eighteen year olds can do. Small town star quarterback and quintessential dreamy boy next door, Tate “Nighthawk” Taylor has never thought much about his extra abilities. Sure, his night vision comes in handy during games, but who wouldn’t want that extra edge? From the moment Foster and Tate collide, their worlds spiral and a deadly tornado forces them to work together, fully awakening their not-so-natural ability - the power to control air. As they each deal with the tragic loss of loved ones, they’re caught by another devastating blow – they are the first in a group of teens genetically manipulated before birth to bond with the elements, and worse... they’re being hunted. Now, Foster and Tate must fight to control their abilities as they learn of their past, how they came to be, who’s following them, and what tomorrow will bring... more DYSASTERS? “If you thought that there was no reason left for living after the end of the Sorcerer’s Ring series, you were wrong.

Morgan has managed again to produce a strong set of characters that make us cheer for them on every page.…Recommended for the permanent library of all readers that love a well-written fantasy.” --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos  The #1 Bestseller!  From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes a sweeping new epic fantasy series: RISE OF THE DRAGONS (KINGS AND SORCERERS—Book 1).  Kyra, 15, dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, even though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. As she struggles to understand her special skills, her mysterious inner power, she realizes she is different than the others. But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her to wonder who she really is.  When Kyra comes of age and the local lord comes to take her away, her father wants to wed her off to save her. Kyra, though, refuses, and she journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragon—and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever.  15 year old Alec, meanwhile, sacrifices for his brother, taking his place in the draft, and is carted off to The Flames, a wall of flames a hundred feet high that wards off the army of Trolls to the east. On the far side of the kingdom, Merk, a mercenary striving to leave behind his dark past, quests through the wood to become a Watcher of the Towers and help guard the Sword of Fire, the magical source of the kingdom’s power. But the Trolls want the Sword, too—and they prepare for a massive invasion that could destroy the kingdoms forever.  With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, RISE OF THE DRAGONS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, of ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders.  Book #2 in KINGS AND SORCERERS is now available!  “RISE OF THE DRAGONS succeeds—right from the start…. A superior fantasy…It begins, as it should, with one protagonist's struggles and moves neatly into a wider circle of knights, dragons, magic and monsters, and destiny.…All the trappings of high fantasy are here, from soldiers and battles to confrontations with self….A recommended winner for any who enjoy epic fantasy writing fueled by powerful, believable young adult protagonists.” --Midwest Book Review, D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer Often the decision between a customer choosing you over someone like you is your ability to know exactly what to say, when to say it, and how to make it count. Phil M.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images file photo) Fox News host Sean Hannity appeared to insert himself into the congressional investigation of President Donald Trump in an interview with Trump aired Thursday night, leading to speculation that he could be subpoenaed. Hannity asserted to the president that Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney who testified in front of the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, gave him information that conflicts with Cohen’s testimony. Cohen explained to the committee that Trump directed him to make illegal hush money payments to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels. On Thursday Hannity told Trump “I can tell you personally, he said to me at least a dozen times, that he [Cohen] made the decision on the payments and he didn’t tell you.” Cohen vs. the GOP: The many defenses for Trump Hannity’s comment caught the attention of Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island. “I look forward to his [Hannity’s] testimony,” Cicilline said in a tweet. Sean Hannity is now volunteering himself as a witness. I look forward to his testimony. https://t.co/eOjhlkg4mU  National security lawyer Bradley P. Moss had a similar thought. “Hannity just made himself a witness in a congressional inquiry and the SDNY [Southern District of New York] probe,” Moss said. The president declared in a succession of tweets Friday that Cohen is “totally discredited” and he criticized Democrats for pursuing investigative inquiries about his finances. Oh’ I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, “gee, I have an idea, let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/congressional-hearings-conspiracy-theories/---split---Stanley Kubrick helped the US government fake the moon landing. Beyoncé and Jay-Z are in the Illuminati. These stories are so well-worn that folks know them by heart. By now, conspiracy theories are a part of everyday American life—so much so that they even come from the mouths of besuited members of Congress on live television. Consider President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen's hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. If you're a Trump backer, you probably didn't enjoy Democrats Jamie Raskin and Jackie Speier questioning Cohen about the often-alleged-but-never-confirmed pee and elevator tapes, but you weren't surprised. If you lean left, Republican Jim Jordan's allegations that Cohen's (Jewish, Clinton-connected) lawyer, Lanny Davis, was the hearing's puppeteer was likely frustrating, but not shocking. How to Not Fall for Viral Scares How'd the Cohen Hearing Go? That Depends on Your Filter Bubble Michael Cohen's Credibility Has Never Been More Certain Yet, all of this should leave you flabbergasted. Members of Congress ought to come armed with evidence—any evidence—before they air out a theory in such a formal setting. But these things go largely unchecked, because more and more often no one is surprised; they're inoculated to it. For some committee members, demonstrating that they're hep to their constituents' online musings seems to supersede congressional hearings' purpose: fact-finding. We've now entered the age of conspiracy politics. Even before they became a Trump-era norm, conspiracy-minded congressional hearings were something of an American political tradition. In 1954, as the Red Scare reached its panic point and the McCarthy hearings began, the stakes for what had been dry and wonkish inquiries changed forever: For the first time, hearings would be televised, live and in their entirety. Scholars at the time argued that the broadcasts were making a spectacle of governance, that providing politicians opportunities for televised grandstanding would leave the public (and congressional investigators) short on facts and long on partisan rhetoric. They were right. By the mid-1970s, congressional hearings were no longer just about information gathering—they had become what cultural anthropologist Phyllis Pease Chock calls "ritual performance" of participants' ideologies. Whether there's real truth to uncover is irrelevant: Watergate (and the Iran-Contra affair and President George W. Bush's Iraq exaggerations) were as rife with conspiratorial partisan snipery as Benghazi. "A party out of power will often push far-fetched claims about the president and his party. Sometimes it's a necessary counterweight," says Joseph Uscinski, author of American Conspiracy Theories. That's the argument Democrats might make for their own conspiracy-driven windmill tilting. "What's changed in the Trump era is Donald Trump." Even before they became a Trump-era norm, conspiracy-minded congressional hearings were something of an American political tradition. Typically, the party of the president (and the president himself) eschew conspiracy narratives. Breaking that rule used to come with swift penalty. As First Lady, Hillary Clinton was mocked for claiming she and President Clinton were the victims of a "vast right-wing conspiracy," and so was President Obama when a 2012 campaign ad insinuated "secretive oil billionaires" were out to get him. Not so with President Trump. "Conspiracy theorists brought him to the prom, so now he has to dance with them," Uscinski says. Politicians who want to escape the president's Twitter-amplified ire (and please Trump-voting constituents) have to step in time. The echoes of "deep state" anxieties and other right-wing conspiracy theories that echoed through the hearings of James Comey, William Barr, Peter Strzok, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Michael Cohen, and just about anybody who's sat before Congress in the last two years, weren't made by disconnected congresspeople left in the sun too long. They were made by canny politicians toeing a new party line more confidently with each hearing. The result is a constant hail of conspiracy theories beating down from political elites on both sides of the aisle. That worries Katherine Einstein, an American public policy and misinformation researcher at Boston University. "What's scary is that there's spillover," Einstein says. "Exposure to conspiracy theories about any aspect of government reduces your trust in its institutions overall. These hearings are going to diminish trust in the House and Senate." What other reasonable reaction could there be to a fact-finding squad with members doing their best to deflect attention from the facts? In a way, the internet dumped butane on the fire started by televising the Red Scare. It's now possible to consume only curated snippets of the news that suit your own mores and biases, and conspiracy theorists have never been so able to easily rally together or had access to a wider swathe of humanity to sway. That's when objective reality starts to slip. "We're not able to decide when something is a conspiracy anymore," says Adam Klein, who teaches a course on propaganda at Pace University. "The stigma of believing in a conspiracy theory might start going away because people disagree about basic reality, and have very partisan ideas about who the conspirators are." This, of course, is the danger. If everyone can occupy a universe of information of their own choosing, it's not just politicians who are apt to fall prey to bias-confirming conspiracies—we all are. But that's just a theory. There's a lot of bad logic out there. WIRED's Jason Tanz explains how to spot and fight the dumbest arguments online. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption White House communications official Bill Shine (left), then-White House chief of staff John Kelly and senior adviser Jared Kushner wait in the Oval Office in December 2018. The New York Times reports that Kelly opposed Kushner's security clearance, but President Trump overruled him and others. The House oversight committee is demanding the White House turn over documents and witness interviews that it had previously requested as it probes the security clearance process at the White House. This comes after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that President Trump ordered a top secret clearance for son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, despite the concerns of intelligence officials and then-White House chief of staff John Kelly. The security clearance issue is complex. Here is what you need to know. Security clearances ensure the protection of information the U.S. gathers about foreign nations, and the way it is gathered. Andrew Bakaj, an attorney and former CIA intelligence officer, says giving rigorous background checks and security clearances serves to shield both the "people or entities that we rely on to gather information and intelligence — and the information that is gathered." In other words, it's supposed to protect what American spies know and how they learned it. There are three in increasing order of their importance: Confidential, secret, and top secret. There is also a separate category, sensitive compartmented information, or SCI. The difference between secret and top secret, Bakaj says, is the "sensitivity of the information that you'll have access to." Disclosure of secret information can cause serious damage to national security. Disclosure of top secret information can cause grave damage. People with a TS-level clearance can get specific SCI certificates about areas on which they need to work. That means that someone working on the CIA's Asia desk might know a lot about North Korea, for example, but may not necessarily have the same level of access to material about Syria. The hope behind the system is that no one person comes to know so much that he or she alone could cause major damage by leaking to a reporter or spying for a foreign government. Apparently, lots of folks. More than 3 million federal civilian and military jobs require some sort of clearance from confidential up to top secret. That's more than half of all federal jobs. Another 1.2 million clearances are held by contract employees. Most are in the defense, homeland security and cybersecurity sectors, but even the people who clean the buildings that house those workers, or who work in food service in sensitive locations need them. What's more, there is a backlog of more than 500,000 applicants who are waiting to get their clearances processed. The importance of the jobs that require them — and the difficulty of getting one — mean they're valuable and they often add to the income of the workers who can obtain and keep them. Many military service members and intelligence officers step out of government jobs and into the private sector as contractors to earn more based on their access to secret information. The government's Office of Personnel Management, the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence all have a hand in the process, depending on the position. For White House officials, it's usually the FBI and the White House Security Office, which makes the final decision whether to grant a clearance. People seeking a clearance have to fill out a lengthy form called an SF-86, which asks a lot of questions about applicants: where you've lived, the people you know, who your relatives are, and whether you've had any foreign contacts. The goal is to help authorities determine whether you might be susceptible to compromise or blackmail or other influence to reveal secret information. Kushner has had to make several additions to his SF-86 after failing to mention meetings he had with foreign contacts, including a meeting with Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. But an even bigger red flag, says Bakaj, is the back channel Kushner reportedly discussed creating with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak to discuss policy issues including cooperation in Syria. "That goes to loyalty to the United States, it goes to foreign influence," Bakaj says, and is likely a major reason why Kushner's clearance was flagged by intelligence officials. Kushner has said he didn't collude with any foreigners in 2016 and that he only asked about using Russia's diplomatic communications to exchange information about the war in Syria, not to create a secret "back-channel." Eventually, Kushner's lawyer said he got his objections resolved and regained his access to classified material. That, in turn, has enabled him to continue serving as a roving emissary for Trump — to Mexico, in Europe and in the Middle East. The important news this week was that Trump's aides didn't want Kushner to get his clearance back. In fact, Trump's former chief of staff and former White House counsel wrote memos describing why they didn't think Kushner should have a clearance, according to the reports. Yes. It is an executive branch function, and as chief executive the president has the ultimate authority. Not only did President Trump have authority to give his son in law and adviser Kushner clearance, the president "could conceivably give Vladimir Putin a security clearance," says Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who specializes in national security cases. He said the president can furthermore declassify "the family jewels" — meaning secret documents — "and give them to Putin," if he wanted to. Unlikely as that may seem, Zaid he could find no other occasions where a president has actively involved himself in granting, or withdrawing a security clearance.

---split---8.0---split---https://news.yahoo.com/trump-address-core-conservatives-rough-week-145802946.html---split---National Harbor (United States) (AFP) - President Donald Trump prepared Saturday to address a conference of right-wing activists, capping a turbulent week that included a failed summit with North Korea and explosive testimony by his former lawyer branding him a criminal. The White House has not previewed the themes of the president's speech at the National Harbor near Washington, his third in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) since he was elected. But the president took to Twitter to confirm he would be speaking at 11:30 am (1630 GMT), telling followers: "Record crowd, live broadcast. Enjoy!" Commentators were expecting him to play to his base, however, on red-meat issues such as border security, Second Amendment gun rights and the dangers of "socialism" -- the overriding theme at this year's CPAC. The word has been in heavy rotation since Democratic candidates began openly embracing liberal platforms including a sweeping plan to fight climate change, known as the Green New Deal, and expanding health care coverage. Amid the "Make America Great Again" caps and "Trump 2020" rhinestone pins, a button on the lapels of the many attendees to the four-day conference reflects what may well become the next Republican campaign theme: "Socialism SUCKS." Vice President Mike Pence made the political pilgrimage on Friday to CPAC to warn the faithful that Democrats are taking a "hard left turn" ahead of 2020. "Under the guise of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the last century. That system is socialism," he said. - 'Freedom' or 'socialism' - Voters must choose "between freedom and socialism, between personal responsibility and government dependence," Pence said, as he highlighted the ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela under its socialist rule. "This is the choice we face in the next 20 months," he added. Trump will hope his speech can serve as a diversion to the federal investigation into his campaign's possible collusion with Russia and testimony this week on Capitol Hill by the president's former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen implicating him in crimes. Cohen, about to go to prison after being convicted of lying under oath, took the oath again Wednesday in an extraordinarily theatrical congressional hearing. In December a court sentenced Cohen, who worked for Trump for over a decade as his lawyer and vice president in the Trump Organization, to three years in prison for hush-money payments to two women and for lies to Congress -- both of which he said were to protect Trump -- as well as for tax evasion. In dramatic congressional testimony Wednesday broadcast across the world on cable and US network channels, Cohen turned on his former boss, using the big stage to describe Trump as a "mobster," "con man," "cheat" and a "racist." Meanwhile in Vietnam, a high-stakes second summit between Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un broke up in disarray Thursday, without even a joint statement after the pair failed to reach an agreement on walking back Pyongyang's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Both sides said they were open to further talks, though a third summit has not been scheduled.
---split---9.0---split---https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-trump-hanoi-sanctions-warmbier_n_5c7a1dbae4b0614614da320a---split---North Korea had the more accurate take on what happened at the summit with President Donald Trump before talks failed, according to an official with the U.S. State Department. The president claimed Thursday that he had walked away from negotiations in Hanoi after Kim Jong Un demanded that all sanctions against the nation be lifted. “Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn’t do that,” Trump said. “We had to walk away from that.” But Pyongyang representatives called a late-night news conference later that day to correct Trump’s statements, saying that Kim wanted only economic sanctions imposed since 2016 lifted — and not any concerning weapons. In exchange, Kim offered to shut down the nation’s main nuclear complex — and was prepared to offer in writing a permanent halt to the nation’s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, according to his officials. North Korea’s account of the sanction issue was accurate, a State Department official said Friday in a briefing to the media. The Associated Press reported that Kim had sought the lifting of only United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed since March 2016 — not sanctions going back decades. The concession would have removed sanctions on a range of goods, but not weapons. Kim’s position was no surprise, the official said, because it had been brought up repeatedly in lower-level talks. But Trump and his negotiators decided lifting the sanctions posed from 2016 onward was too much. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Trump’s reaction puzzled Kim. She said that Kim “may have lost his will [to continue] North Korea-U.S. dealings,” the AP reported. Trump on Friday, meanwhile, tried to backpedal from his comments Thursday that he believed Kim’s statement that he had no idea what had happened to American student Otto Warmbier while he was in a North Korean prison. Warmbier died after being returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state in 2017. Kim “tells me he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word,” Trump said at a press conference in Hanoi. "I don't think the top leadership knew about it. Those prisons are rough" President Donald Trump says Kim Jong-un "felt very badly" about the death of US student Otto Warmbier who was imprisoned in North Korea#Hanoisummit latest: https://t.co/CbibiArgBi pic.twitter.com/QhKUA1XbMK Warmbier’s parents shot back in a statement that “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.” Trump responded that his words had been “misinterpreted,” that he “loves” Otto Warmbier, and “of course I hold North Korea responsible for his mistreatment and death.” I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....

The American Conservative Union hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to discuss the conservative agenda. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Vice President Mike Pence warned a conservative audience Friday that allowing Democrats to gain more power would mean allowing them to enact “tired” policies that amount to socialism. “Over the next 20 months, we have a decision to make, will we re-elect a president who is making America great again?” Pence asked. “Or will we let America take a hard left turn?” The crowd roared boos. “Under the guise of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the past century,” Pence said to applause. “That system is socialism. Trump: Green New Deal sounds like a ‘high school term paper that got a low mark’ “And the only thing green about the so-called Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost taxpayers if we do it: $90 trillion,” he said. Democrats have said the price tag would be lower than the figure Pence quoted. His comments to the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington continued a White House and Republican National Committee push to paint the opposition party has hellbent on making America’s economy one that is centrally planned from Washington and intent on taking money out of Americans’ pockets to finance a myriad social programs. Pence on Friday warned about “bumper sticker slogans” and “slick social media campaigns” that he said paper over the most failed system in “the history of the world.” His pitch was straightforward: “freedom” conquers and leads to prosperity, while socialism is built on “government coercion” and drags down countries with unaffordable federal programs. [Trump: Cohen book pitch shows he ‘committed perjury on a scale not seen before’] “We want to make poverty more rare, they want to make poverty more comfortable,” he said of Democrats. “We must say with one voice: America will never be a socialist country.” The crowd errupted in a loud “U-S-A!” chant. President Donald Trump kicked the socialism warning campaign into high gear with his Feb. 5 State of the Union address. He kept it up during a rally a few days later in Texas. “There are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States,” Trump said during a Feb. 11 campaign rally in El Paso, Texas. “So I again say to you — and I say it for the world to hear — America will never be a socialist country,” he said to applause. Trump and senior GOP officials have latched onto policies and comments made by newly minted Democratic lawmakers like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described “democratic socialist,” to argue the entire party has shifted considerably to the left. What’s more, the president has used the unrest in Venezuela to kick off what he and his top aides call a campaign to rid the entire Western Hemisphere of socialist governments. “The tyrannical socialist government nationalized private industries and took over private businesses,” Trump said in Miami of the embattled Nicolas Maduro-led government there during a Feb. 18 speech to exiles from the South American country. “Socialism, by its very nature, does not respect borders. It does not respect boundaries or the sovereign rights of its citizens or its neighbors,” he said. “It's always seeking to expand, to encroach, and to subjugate others to its will.” [3 takeaways: Trump-Kim collapse ‘a breakdown that ... didn’t need to happen’] Pence did the same on Friday, transitioning from his warnings about socialism at home to his declaration that “Nicolas Mudaro must go” because “what Venezuela needs is freedom.” All of Trump’s and Pence’s warnings are built on themes they routinely use — as Pence did Friday — to fire up their conservative base, which will need to turn out in big numbers again if they hope to win a second term. Meantime, the VP revved up the crowd early in his remarks by saying the Trump administration has begun construction of Trump’s proposed southern border wall. Democrats and immigration analysts, however, say no new barrier has been erected — just replacement fencing in some areas. “Before we’re done,” he said, “we’re going to build it all.” The crowd reacted with a “build that wall!” chant that lasted nearly a minute. “Oh, we’re building it,” the vice president quipped. “Like the president says, ‘Don’t worry about it.’” Watch: Democrats downplay appearance of disunity on Green New Deal Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (right) hold a bilateral meeting during the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday. Gary Samore is a professor of the practice of politics at Brandeis University and the senior executive director of the Crown Center for Middle East Studies. He has participated in face-to-face U.S. talks with North Korea for over 25 years and is a former senior adviser on weapons of mass destruction to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The failure to reach a deal on denuclearization at this week's summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. For President Trump, the failure demonstrates that his personal rapport with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is no substitute for adequate preparations to resolve the difficult and complex issues involved in stopping the North's nuclear weapons program. To avoid another embarrassment, Trump is unlikely to agree to a third summit unless a deal has been precooked so that he is certain of enjoying a successful signing ceremony. For Kim, the failure shows that he cannot bypass the U.S. government to get a sweetheart deal directly from President Trump. To the extent that the Singapore summit last year led Kim to believe that Trump is a soft mark, Trump's decision to walk away from Hanoi leaves Kim with little choice but to engage in traditional tough negotiations at the working level to get the sanctions relief he seeks. What will happen next? While walking away from the table in Hanoi, Trump kept the door open to continue negotiations. He made clear that he is prepared (indeed eager) to continue the freeze on major joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises and meet with Kim for another summit if it would be productive. In fact, the United States had been pressing North Korea for working-level negotiations between Special Representative Steve Biegun and his counterpart Ambassador Kim Hyok Chol in the runup to Hanoi, but the North Koreans resisted until the last minute. The failure to reach a deal on denuclearization at this week's summit in Hanoi may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Gary Samore, Brandeis University There are two reasons to believe that Kim Jong Un will not abandon negotiations and will not resume nuclear and missile testing. First, North Korea has already made sufficient progress toward the development of thermonuclear weapons and long-range missiles so that a continuation of the moratorium on testing does not impose a significant technical price. Second, North Korea's economic duress is not urgent. Since Kim halted his testing campaign and shifted to a diplomatic campaign last year, North Korea has enjoyed substantial de facto sanctions relief as China and Russia have relaxed sanctions enforcement. A resumption of testing might provoke Beijing and Moscow to once again join Washington's campaign of "maximum pressure." If North Korea agrees to resume working-level talks, three issues will dominate. First, both Washington and Pyongyang agree that the next significant step toward denuclearization requires constraints on North Korea's production of fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon, but they disagree on the extent of those constraints. North Korea has offered to "permanently dismantle" its nuclear facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear center. This would reduce the rate of production, but not halt production of fissile material because North Korea could continue to operate undeclared enrichment facilities outside Yongbyon. In contrast, the U.S. is seeking a comprehensive halt to fissile material production, which would require dismantlement of all such facilities, whether located within Yongbyon or elsewhere. The U.S. proposal would also require that North Korea allow international access to its secret nuclear facilities outside Yongbyon to verify that the facilities have been shut down and dismantled. The second contentious issue is U.S. reciprocity. Both sides agree that the U.S. will take "corresponding measures" (in North Korean parlance) or "simultaneous and parallel" actions (in American parlance), but they disagree on the nature and magnitude of the U.S. steps. The U.S. has discussed proposals such as issuing a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and establishing liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang. What North Korea really wants is sanctions relief. As President Trump revealed in his Hanoi news conference after talks collapsed Thursday, the North Koreans demanded an extravagantly high price in terms of extensive sanctions relief in exchange for the modest step of dismantling Yongbyon. Naturally, the U.S. wants to expend as little leverage as possible for partial denuclearization steps, while retaining its biggest bargaining chips for the far more difficult challenges of reducing and eventually eliminating North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The third tough issue, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alluded to in Hanoi, is sequencing. North Korea wants to get paid upfront before the process of dismantlement is completed, while the U.S. wants to withhold payment until North Korea delivers on its commitments. Inevitably, any deal will require a complicated choreography of steps toward dismantlement matched by reciprocal actions by the U.S. and its allies, principally South Korea, which is eager to pursue economic projects with the North on generous financial terms. The details of such an arrangement can only be hammered out in lengthy negotiations between diplomats and experts from both sides. After the failure in Hanoi, the ball is in Kim's court to decide whether to abandon hopes of a quick and easy deal and authorize serious working-level negotiations to complete an agreement that he and Trump can sign at a third summit. The bet here is that he will. Whether Biegun and Ambassador Kim can work out an agreement within the limited time remaining in President Trump's first term is uncertain, but it's worth the effort.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/us/politics/mark-penn-trump-clinton.html---split---Supported by White House Memo By Annie Karni WASHINGTON — Mark J. Penn, one of the primary architects of President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, met briefly with President Trump in the Oval Office last week, according to two people in attendance. The face-to-face meeting, the first between Mr. Trump and the onetime loyal adviser to the Clintons, marked what some saw as the inevitable conclusion of Mr. Penn’s long-running political metamorphosis. As Democrats have moved to the left, Mr. Penn, with his centrist politics, has become alienated from a party in which he once reigned as a winning pollster and is a frequent guest on Fox News and the author of op-ed articles criticizing the special counsel’s investigation as a “partisan, open-ended inquisition.” He has even adopted the president’s term “deep state” to describe people he views as Democratic operatives sabotaging the Trump administration from within the government. Mr. Penn arrived at the White House last week with Andrew Stein, a Democrat and former president of the New York City Council, who has known Mr. Trump for decades. Mr. Penn, who was credited with helping to keep Mr. Clinton focused during his impeachment, sat across the Resolute Desk from the president at a moment when Democratic lawmakers are wrestling with whether to begin impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump as the special counsel’s investigation finally comes to an end. But people in attendance said the meeting was not about politics or impeachment, and was brief. It was scheduled, according to one person who was there, by Mr. Stein. Mr. Penn, who last fall helped write an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal titled “Hillary Will Run Again,” came along at Mr. Stein’s invitation. In the meeting, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Penn for his commentary on the special counsel’s investigation and pumped him about how to interpret the findings of his public poll, the Harris Poll, which puts the president’s favorability rating at about 45 percent. The three former New Yorkers also spent time discussing Edward I. Koch, the New York mayor who was Mr. Penn’s first client and a longtime nemesis of Mr. Trump’s. The two engaged in heated battles over Mr. Trump’s development projects. Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, and Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, also attended the meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes. In an email, Mr. Penn played down the significance of the visit. “I tagged along with my friend Andrew Stein at his request to one of his meetings, and for the first time to meet the president,” he said. “I have had hundreds of meetings with presidents and I don’t relay their conversations, but this was a cordial meeting and no advice was given or taken — but old-time politics was discussed.” Mr. Penn added, “Despite my misgivings about the Mueller investigation, let me be clear as a lifelong Democrat under no circumstances would I work paid or unpaid for President Trump nor was this meeting about that in any way.” Reached late Friday night, however, Mr. Stein said he invited Mr. Penn to the meeting specifically to discuss polls with Mr. Trump. Mr. Penn was one of three advisers who helped Mr. Clinton navigate toward the political center when he battling a newly empowered Republican majority in Congress led by Newt Gingrich, then the House speaker. He stuck with the Clintons longer than some of Mr. Clinton’s other political gurus, like Dick Morris and Douglas E. Schoen, who became highly vocal Clinton antagonists. Mr. Penn also helped Mrs. Clinton win a New York Senate seat in 2000. But his fallout with the onetime reigning brand in Democratic politics began during Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, where he clashed with other advisers and was ultimately removed as the chief strategist. Over the past year, like Mr. Schoen and Mr. Morris, he too has won praise on the other side of the political spectrum as he has become seen as a heretic on the left. Mr. Penn has been praised internally at the White House, and by the president himself, for his fulsome attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In his appearances on Fox News — he last appeared on MSNBC in September 2017 — and in his opinion pieces in the conservative-leaning opinions pages of The Hill, Mr. Penn has accused Mr. Mueller of overreaching in his investigation. But an actual sit-down meeting with the president in the Oval Office was, for some former colleagues of Mr. Penn, the inevitable outcome of what they see as his rightward lurch. “Some people are loyal to Republican red, some people to Democratic blue and some capitalism green,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton, who served as her gatekeeper in the Senate and at the State Department. Mr. Penn currently runs the Stagwell Group, a private equity firm, and claims his political career is behind him, even though his firm owns two public affairs agencies that have worked for both Democratic and Republican officials. In an interview with Politico Magazine last year, Mr. Penn said that as a White House adviser during Ken Starr’s investigation into Mr. Clinton, he saw up close the emotional damage that a special counsel can wreak on a president and on a functional White House. And he said he saw little difference in how the investigation affected Mr. Clinton then and Mr. Trump now — even though Mr. Clinton never tweeted the words “Witch Hunt!” “The Clintons didn’t put their emotions on Twitter, but trust me, they had them, and they weren’t particularly different from Trump’s,” he said. Mr. Clinton, for his part, has dismissed his former adviser’s commentary. “He wasn’t invited back into the campaign,” Bill Clinton said in a “PBS NewsHour” interview last summer. “He’s been mad about it, and I think it’s silly.” Mr. Clinton called Mr. Penn’s arguments attacking Mr. Mueller “silly and dangerous.” An earlier version of this article misstated the frequency of appearances of the political strategist Mark J. Penn on MSNBC. He last appeared on the network in September 2017; he was not formally banned.  OpinionMark Penn and Andrew Stein Advertisement
---split---13.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/congress-applauds-trump-not-making-bad-deal-kim-jong-un-questions-trust-dictator---split---Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among the lawmakers who supported President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Members of Congress are glad President Donald Trump didn’t emerge from his meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with a bad bargain, but some are blasting the president’s taking the dictator at his word about the deadly treatment of U.S. citizen Otto Warmbier. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, said she’s “glad that the president walked away” from the North Korean leader’s offer to denuclearize only if the United States lifted all sanctions against his country. “It’s good that the president did not give him anything for the little that he was proposing,” the California Democrat said. Still, Pelosi wondered why it took Trump as long as he did to realize Kim’s motivations were not well intentioned. Lawmakers were also alarmed that Trump seemed to shield Kim from responsibility for the treatment of Warmbier, an American college student, who died shortly after being released from North Korean captivity. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, compared Trump’s comments about Warmbier to the president not holding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for the murder of former Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. “I strongly object to the President trying to excuse Kim Jong Un for the death of Otto Warmbier. Otto was a student at the University of Virginia and he was brutalized by the North Korean regime,” Kaine said in a statement to Roll Call. “The notion that Kim Jong Un would have been unaware of the physical condition of this very highly publicized American prisoner is just beyond belief.” “And of course, it reminds us of President Trump stating that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, MBS, had no knowledge of the plans to torture and murder Virginia resident, journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” Kaine said. House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff also focused on what Trump told reporters about Warmbier before the president departed Vietnam. “President Trump’s credulous acceptance of Kim’s denial of any involvement in the death of Otto Warmbier is detestable and harkens back to Trump’s acceptances of other equally implausible denials from other dictators. American diplomacy is strongest when it is rooted in our nation’s core values,” the California Democrat said in a statement. “There must be no full normalization of relations with the DPRK until the regime permanently ceases its gross human rights violations.” Schiff did say Trump’s decision to leave without reaching an agreement with the North Koreans was preferable to the alternative, but that the result of the summit demonstrated a lack of strong advance work. “The most telling sign of North Korea’s fundamental lack of commitment to real denuclearization can be seen in its refusal to provide a detailed accounting of its nuclear and missile sites,” Schiff said. “The Trump Administration’s decision that this would not be required before a second summit with the President was a serious mistake, and one that allowed Kim the prestige of sharing the world stage with a U.S. President while committing to nothing in return.” Opening the Senate Thursday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky praised the president’s decision to end negotiations due to insufficient progress on denuclearization. “Kim Jong Un now has a long train ride home, and he will have time to reflect on the future that is still within North Korea’s grasp. But the president has demonstrated that such a future must be accompanied by real de-nuclearization. Every country has a stake in North Korea’s de-nuclearization,” McConnell said. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer also said Trump made the correct decision in walking away without an agreement, praising the president’s refusal to accept a “poor deal” and urged the president to continue insisting on “complete verifiable denuclearization.” Schumer also advocated a similar approach in upcoming negotiations with China, saying Trump has a “generational imperative” to insist on “enduring structural reform” of Chinese trade policy, an issue the Democrat from New York called “critical to American economic security.

The Warmbiers are seen here at the U.N., where they spoke about human rights last May. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters hide caption Cindy and Fred Warmbier, parents of Otto Warmbier, released a statement saying, "No excuses or lavish praise can change" the fact that they hold North Korean leader Kim Jong Un responsible for their son's death. The Warmbiers are seen here at the U.N., where they spoke about human rights last May. Updated at 4:55 p.m. ET After President Trump seemingly absolved North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, the Ohio man's parents say they disagree and that "Kim and his evil regime are responsible." The issue arose in Vietnam on Thursday when Trump was asked at a news conference if he had talked to Kim — whom he has called a "friend" — about Warmbier, who died in 2017 shortly after his release from more than a year of detention in North Korea. Trump said he had asked Kim about it. "I really don't think it was in his interest at all," Trump said of the North Korean dictator. He later added, "He tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word." After Trump spoke about his meeting with Kim in Hanoi, Fred and Cindy Warmbier issued a statement saying: "We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that. Thank you." Trump responded on Friday afternoon in a pair of tweets in which he wrote, "I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family." "Of course I hold North Korea responsible ... for Otto's mistreatment and death," Trump wrote, but he did not mention Kim as bearing responsibility. ....for Otto’s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often! When Warmbier was detained, he was accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster. By the time he was released in June 2017, he was in a coma, gravely ill. He died soon after his return to the United States. Fred and Cindy Warmbier issued their statement two months after a U.S. federal judge awarded them $500 million in their wrongful death lawsuit against North Korea — a lawsuit in which they said Kim's regime had "brutally tortured and murdered" their 22-year-old son. North Korea, which has previously tried to explain Otto Warmbier's death as being caused by botulism, did not participate in the case. The parents of Otto Warmbier react to a standing ovation during President Trump's Jan. 30, 2018, State of the Union address on Capitol Hill in Washington. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption The parents of Otto Warmbier react to a standing ovation during President Trump's Jan. 30, 2018, State of the Union address on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Warmbiers attended Trump's State of the Union address at his invitation in January 2018, receiving a standing ovation when he introduced them during the speech. When their son died, months earlier, Trump had offered his condolences and said his administration will work "to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency." Even as he made what many see as a 180-degree shift by no longer holding Kim responsible, Trump acknowledged having a personal relationship with the Warmbiers when he was asked about Otto on Thursday. "I know the Warmbier family very well," he said. "I think they're an incredible family. What happened is horrible. I really believe something very bad happened to him, and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it." Trump's comments drew a critical response from members of Ohio's congressional delegation, including Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who took to the Senate floor hours after the president's remarks to say the U.S. cannot be "naive" about Kim and about what happened to Warmbier. Portman said that his experience in trying to aid the Warmbiers' attempts to help their son had convinced him that it's important for the U.S. to have more open lines of communication with North Korea. But he added that the way Kim's government had treated the young American was "unforgivable." "We can't be naive about what they did to Otto, about the brutal nature of the regime that would do this to an American citizen," Portman said. "And of course, it's not just about Otto or other visitors — it's about how the people of North Korea are treated, many of whom have also had their human rights violated." Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, told ABC News that Trump has a duty to fight human rights abuses in the international arena — and that Warmbier's case is a prime example. "You never should go meet with the North Korean dictator without bringing up the name of Otto Warmbier and bring up the whole issue of human rights over and over," Brown said. "That's who we are as a country." NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor
---split---15.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/opinion/john-dean-michael-cohen.html---split---Supported by My appearance before Congress helped take down a president. Will the same thing happen to Trump? By John W. Dean Mr. Dean was a White House counsel under Richard Nixon. There are several parallels between my testimony before Congress in 1973, about President Richard Nixon and his White House, and Michael Cohen’s testimony this week about President Trump and his business practices. Setting aside the differences regarding how we got there, we both found ourselves speaking before Congress, in multiple open and closed venues, about criminal conduct of a sitting president of the United States. This is not a pleasant place to be, particularly given the presidents involved. There are some differences: Unlike Mr. Cohen, who testified in public for a day, I testified for five days. His prepared statement was about 4,000 words; mine was some 60,000 words. Nielsen reports over 16 million people watched his testimony. I am told over 80 million people watched all or part of mine. Polls varied widely after my testimony. One said 50 percent of Americans believed me, 30 percent did not, and 20 percent were not sure. Another poll had 38 percent believing the president, who denied my statement, and 37 percent believing me. The instant polls on Mr. Cohen’s testimony vary by party affiliation, as was the case with my polls. But 35 percent found him credible. I believe that number will grow. While my testimony was eventually corroborated by secret recordings of our conversations made by Mr. Nixon, before that it was other witnesses who made the difference. I was surprised by the number of people who surfaced to support my account. The same, I suspect, will happen for Michael Cohen. The Mafia’s code of omertà has no force in public service. I have heard no one other than Roger Stone say he will go to jail for Donald Trump. Mr. Cohen should understand that if Mr. Trump is removed from office, or defeated in 2020, in part because of his testimony, he will be reminded of it for the rest of his life. He will be blamed by Republicans but appreciated by Democrats. If he achieves anything short of discovering the cure for cancer, he will always live in this pigeonhole. How do I know this? I am still dealing with it. Just as Mr. Nixon had his admirers and apologists, so it is with Mr. Trump. Some of these people will forever be rewriting history, and they will try to rewrite it at Mr. Cohen’s expense. They will put words in his mouth that he never spoke. They will place him at events at which he wasn’t present and locations where he has never been. Some have tried rewriting my life, and they will rewrite his, too. I am thinking of people like Mr. Stone, the longtime Trump associate who worked on the 1972 Nixon campaign and so admires the former president that he has a tattoo of the man’s likeness between his shoulder blades. Mr. Stone, whom I never met while at the White House, has been indicted as part of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, on charges of lying to Congress about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. He prides himself as a political dirty trickster, and he has never met a conspiracy theory he did not believe. Mr. Cohen can be sure that Mr. Stone will promote new conspiracy theories to defend Mr. Trump and himself, even if it means rewriting history. Presidential scandals tend to attract a remarkable number of dishonest “historians.” There is one overarching similarity that Mr. Cohen and I share. He came to understand and reject Mr. Trump as I did Mr. Nixon. Mr. Nixon first called on me regarding Watergate some eight months after the arrests of his re-election committee operatives at the Watergate. We had 37 conversations, and when I felt I had his confidence, I tried but failed to get him to end the cover-up. The day I told Mr. Nixon there was a cancer on his presidency was the day I met the real Nixon. I knew I had to break rank. Mr. Cohen has likewise come to see Mr. Trump for his true nature. At the very end of his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, he sought permission to read a closing statement. He thanked the members, and again accepted responsibility for his bad behavior. He then told the legislators, “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power, and this is why I agreed to appear before you today.” This was the most troubling — actually, chilling — thing he said in his five hours before the committee. Since Mr. Cohen’s warning came in his closing words, there was no opportunity for committee members to ask follow-up questions. So I double-checked with his lawyer, Lanny Davis, if I had understood Mr. Cohen’s testimony correctly. Mr. Davis responded, “He was referring to Trump’s authoritarian mind-set, and lack of respect for democracy and democratic institutions.” Indeed, what is most similar about my and Mr. Cohen’s testimony is that we both challenged authoritarian presidents of the United States by revealing their lies and abuses of power. Mr. Trump is the first authoritarian president since Mr. Nixon, and neither he nor his supporters will play fair. Mr. Cohen will be dealing with these people the rest of his life. In fact, all Americans are affected by the growing authoritarianism that made Mr. Trump president. These people who facilitated his rise will remain long after Mr. Trump is gone. We need to pay more attention. John W. Dean, who served as White House counsel under Richard Nixon, is the author of “Conservatives Without Conscience,” which he is revising to discuss Donald Trump and his followers in collaboration with Bob Altemeyer, a retired professor of psychology at the University of Manitoba, a leading expert on authoritarianism.

---split---16.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/michael-cohen-bad-person-good-witness---split---Michael Cohen came across as weak, lost lapdog. But he was also a convincing witness, Shapiro writes. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) OPINION — There was something sad and delusional about Michael Cohen’s insistence during a riveting day of testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee that he remains, despite it all, a “good person.” During his 30-minute opening statement, Cohen declared, in a passage that came close to defying the internal logic of the English language, “I have lied. But I am not a liar. And I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump.” Later, in response to low-key questioning by maverick conservative Republican Justin Amash, Cohen said, “I’ve always tried to be a good person. I’ve tried to be a great friend.” Cohen’s self-deception went far beyond the awkward reality — pointed out by the Republicans with the chiming regularity of Big Ben — that he is a convicted felon and disbarred lawyer who will be going to prison for three years for, among other misdeeds, lying to Congress on Donald Trump’s behalf. The Democrats’ star witness came across as a weak, lost man who belatedly realized after 10 years of lapdog service to the real estate hustler who is now president “that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump Tower had much to do with the bad decisions in part that I made.” For a decade, Cohen took his direction from Trump’s lack of a moral compass. Whether it was stiffing contractors, arranging payoffs, finagling financial documents or composing comically belligerent letters on his legal stationery, Cohen did whatever ugly deeds the Trump job required. In one of the few comic moments in the hearing, Democrat Jackie Speier ran through a series of guesses about how many threats Cohen had made on Trump’s behalf before the defrocked lawyer admitted that the number was probably more than 500. But, for all Cohen’s failures as a human being, he proved to be something far more important Wednesday — a convincing witness. Recognizing that the testimony of a convicted perjurer comes with certain credibility problems, Cohen backed up some of his explosive charges with documents. Despite Trump’s many denials that he knew about the hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Cohen brought with him an Aug. 1, 2017, $35,000 reimbursement check signed with the president’s characteristic scrawl. Cohen also recounted his first “awe-inspiring” visit to the Oval Office in 2017. But the patriotic grandeur of the moment was marred when the president told Cohen that his monthly repayments (masquerading as a legal retainer) were delayed because it took time for the checks to get to the Oval Office for Trump’s signature because they had been sent via Federal Express. It has been nearly a half-century since these kind of sleazy high-level financial dealings have taken place within the White House. Watch: Cohen’s entire opening statement The closest analogue in moral terms was the payoffs from Maryland real estate developers and engineering firms that Spiro Agnew received while vice president. Beginning in early 1969, the bagman would regularly phone Agnew’s White House office to say that he had “information” for the vice president. The two men would meet and Agnew would pocket an envelope containing as much as $10,000 in cash. It is worth noting that Agnew abandoned the vice presidency in October 1973 in plea deal to avoid being indicted for income tax evasion and facing probable imprisonment. Ten months later, Richard Nixon resigned over Watergate. Not all of life can be buttressed with a paper trail, so some of the TNT at the hearing depended on Cohen’s assertions that could not be quickly confirmed with a canceled check, a tape recording or another document. In his opening statement, Cohen recalled that he was listening in Trump’s personal office in July 2016 when Roger Stone — the recently indicted Republican dirty-trickster — chortled over the speaker phone that WikiLeaks was about to undermine Hillary Clinton’s campaign with a document dump. A few days later, WikiLeaks published an embarrassing set of emails lifted from the computers of the Democratic National Committee. The only evidence so far that Trump knew in advance that something politically helpful was coming from WikiLeaks in July 2016 is Cohen’s recollection, although the former Trump lawyer hinted that federal prosecutors know far more about Stone’s connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. But while all of Cohen’s statements should be regarded with caution, there is a significant factor that suggests that Trump’s longtime fixer may finally be fixed on the truth. The Republican strategy at the hearing was to repeatedly suggest, with a minimum of subtlety, that Cohen has turned on Trump solely to reap a post-prison payoff in the form of book deals and TV contracts. According to the GOP party line, Cohen will now say anything to ingratiate himself with a left-leaning conspiracy of publishers and network executives. But throughout the hearing, Cohen went out of his way to debunk a series of popular liberal conspiracy theories, which is a strange strategy for a man who supposedly wants to be lionized by the left. Cohen denied a recent BuzzFeed story that Trump had personally instructed him to lie to Congress about the planned Moscow Tower. Also rejected were long-standing rumors that Cohen had conspired with Russians in Prague before the election. And Cohen was unequivocal in dismissing the fanciful whispers that Trump used any form of illegal drugs. Maybe Cohen is the liar who finally faced his moment of truth. At minimum, he dropped more breadcrumbs than Hansel and Gretel as grist for future hearings. Wednesday suggested that Trump’s year of torment is only beginning.

---split---17.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/us/trump-otto-warmbier-north-korea.html---split---Supported by By Julie Bosman and Kevin Williams After the American college student Otto Warmbier was released from a North Korea prison in 2017, unresponsive and not expected to survive, his father, Fred, spoke of a comforting phone call from President Trump: “It was gracious, it was nice and it felt good.” During Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address in 2018, Fred Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, stood and wept while Mr. Trump spoke of the “menace” of North Korea and gave tribute to their son, who died days after his release. On Friday, the Warmbiers emerged into the public eye again, this time with a blistering statement directed at the president. They said they could no longer be silent after the summit meeting this week with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and after hearing Mr. Trump say that he believed Mr. Kim’s claim that he did not know what had happened to Mr. Warmbier while he was in custody. “We have been respectful during this summit process,” the Warmbiers said in a statement. “Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.” The outrage went far beyond the Warmbiers, as American political leaders, including members of Mr. Trump’s own party, joined the family in condemning Mr. Kim for Mr. Warmbier’s death. “Americans know, the world knows, Kim Jong-un knows, and most importantly, the Warmbier family knows that Otto suffered a cruel death inflicted by a brutal regime serving Kim Jong-un,” Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, said on Twitter. Mr. Trump has grown increasingly effusive about Mr. Kim since the days, early in the administration, when he referred to the dictator as “Little Rocket Man” and threatened to rain “fire and fury” upon North Korea. “Our relationship is a very special relationship,” he told reporters this week before the summit meeting broke up. And at a rally in September, the president boasted that Mr. Kim “wrote me beautiful letters.” “And they’re great letters,” he said. “We fell in love.” For the Warmbiers, who found an ally in Mr. Trump as the president helped secure the release of their son, it was a striking turnabout. In late 2015, Mr. Warmbier was an adventure-seeking University of Virginia student on a five-day tour of North Korea. As he tried to leave the country, he was detained at the Pyongyang airport, accused of stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was returned to the United States in June 2017 with a catastrophic brain injury, and he died at the age of 22. Mr. Trump said in 2017 that Mr. Warmbier was “tortured beyond belief by North Korea.” But in the aftermath of the summit in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump said that the two leaders discussed Mr. Warmbier, and that Mr. Trump believed Mr. Kim was ignorant of what was happening to Mr. Warmbier while he was imprisoned. “I don’t believe that he would have allowed that to happen; it just wasn’t to his advantage to allow that to happen,” Mr. Trump said afterward. “Those prisons are rough — they’re rough places — and bad things happened. But I really don’t believe that he — I don’t believe that he knew about it.” “He tells me that he didn’t know about it,” Mr. Trump also said, “and I will take him at his word.” Just as the Warmbier family’s plight aroused sympathy around the world after Mr. Warmbier’s 17-month imprisonment, his parents’ statement on Friday was echoed by words of support from a chorus of elected officials in Ohio. Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said in an email: “North Korea murdered Otto Warmbier and the president of the United States has a responsibility to make sure they face the consequences. Anything short of that is unacceptable.” In the Warmbiers’ hometown — Wyoming, Ohio, an affluent enclave of 8,500 people that borders Cincinnati — their neighbors, friends and acquaintances said they were aghast that Mr. Trump appeared to be taking the side of Mr. Kim, a dictator and authoritarian known for his willingness to torture and execute political enemies. “Everybody both loves that family and sympathizes completely with the circumstances they’ve had to deal with,” Jenni McCauley, a Wyoming councilwoman. Mr. Warmbier was an outstanding young man, she said, eager to travel and curious to explore the world. “It’s such a sad thing that Trump said anything in regard to it,” Ms. McCauley said. “We wish he had not said anything.” Founded in 1805, Wyoming boasts century-old, well-kept homes and a tidy downtown with mom-and-pop businesses and a village green park. The area, which is part of Hamilton County, leans Democratic, residents said. Trees and streetlamps that had been wrapped in blue-and-white ribbons in support of Mr. Warmbier at the time of his release stood bare on Friday. When school let out, students spilled out from a campus on foot and filled local coffee shops and bakeries. Patty Pfahler, 59, the owner of a home furnishing store in Wyoming, said that she felt conflicted by the president’s remarks. They “felt sour and reopened old wounds,” Ms. Pfahler said, but she also suggested they might be an effort at international diplomacy. At a coffee shop in town, one employee, Kate Nicholson, 42, said that hearing Mr. Trump say what he did about Mr. Kim “made my stomach hurt.” Darren Wilson, 47, a resident of Wyoming, questioned whether Mr. Kim could really have been ignorant of Mr. Warmbier’s condition while he was imprisoned. “I find it hard to believe that someone who runs a country where the people are so oppressed would not know what is going on with someone like Otto,” Mr. Wilson said. “I don’t personally believe it.” Sherry Sheffield, Wyoming’s unofficial historian, said that residents of the town have tried to give the family privacy to grieve since their son died. “I have heard other people say they’re doing O.K.,” she said. Of the family’s decision to speak out, Ms. Sheffield said, “they’re really in this to make sure that people understand what happened.” The Warmbiers filed a federal lawsuit last year in the United States against the autocratic government, and they were awarded over $501 million in damages, though it is unlikely that they would receive the full amount from North Korea. No one answered the door at the Warmbiers’ home on Friday afternoon. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Friday that his remarks had been “misinterpreted.” “Of course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto’s mistreatment and death,” he said, adding: “I love Otto and think of him often!” Mitch Smith and Sonia Chopra contributed reporting.

---split---19.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/trump-north-korea-mistake/---split---A much-touted two-day summit between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un failed to reach the finish line Thursday, as talks collapsed and Trump returned to Washington, DC. It’s unclear exactly what unraveled the process; Trump says Kim asked for the lifting of all economic sanctions in exchange for closing the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Complex, while North Korea reportedly says it asked for relief on some, but not all. But throwing around blame for Hanoi misses the point: The summit was a mistake to begin with. That’s not to say the US and North Korea shouldn’t pursue negotiations over the Hermit Kingdom’s nuclear disposition. They absolutely should, and will continue to, per Trump’s departing remarks. “Chairman Kim and myself, we want to do the right deal,” Trump said. “Speed is not important.” But within that otherwise upbeat assessment lies the main impediment to real progress in the Korean Peninsula: Trump and Kim should not be the ones doing the deal, at least not the bulk of it. Hanoi is what happens when they try. "You don’t start with the summit. You finish with the summit." Former ambassador Robert Gallucci Trump has built his brand as a master negotiator, despite uneven results in the political realm. And in fairness, his gambit to meet with Kim in Singapore last summer resulted at the very least in what international relations wonks call confidence-building measures. Importantly, North Korea hasn’t tested a ballistic missile or nuclear weapon in over a year. And its relationship with South Korea, while still tense, has somewhat thawed. “These are positive steps, and they show that the North Koreans are at least willing to have negotiations and engage in diplomacy with South Korea and the United States,” says James McKeon, a policy analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a DC-based nonprofit. But in the months since Singapore, North Korea has offered little to no evidence of curtailing its weapons programs. And why would they? Despite Trump’s declaration last June that “there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,” the Singapore accord affirmed only that “the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization.” They’ll get to it, eventually, at some point, or at the very least give it some serious thought. Chalk the vague language, and the resulting lack of verifiable progress, up to Trump’s untraditional diplomacy. “When we first were looking at this going into the Singapore summit, we were saying that it was ass-backwards. This is not the way you’re supposed to do it,” said former ambassador Robert Gallucci in a call with reporters. “You don’t start with the summit. You finish with the summit, and you make sure all the prep work is done, and then the two big guys presumably come together and sign something.” Gallucci would know; as chief US negotiator, he helped secure the 1994 Agreed Framework, which tamped down North Korea’s nuclear ambitions for nearly a decade. And while he acknowledges that tensions between Kim and Trump may have escalated to such a dangerous point last summer—thanks in no small part to Trump’s own rhetoric—that a shotgun summit in Singapore was needed, he and others argue that it’s not a viable process for substantive change. “President Trump’s unorthodox approach to diplomacy has created an opening, starting back in Singapore and continuing to Hanoi,” says Lynn Rusten, who served as senior director for arms control and nonproliferation in the Obama administration and currently works on nuclear issues at the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative. “But the only way that they can capitalize on that and bring it to fruition is to revert now to the more traditional negotiating process.” Hanoi was anything but. Trump appointed the widely respected Stephen Biegun as special envoy to North Korea six months ago, but Biegun has only been able to conduct a single round of working-level talks with his North Korean counterparts. And even that came only in the last three weeks, after Trump announced when the summit would take place during his State of the Union address. Nuclear diplomacy is not American Ninja Warrior. You don’t get bonus points for navigating obstacles faster. “It’s completely unrealistic to think that you can just go in with very little preparation and reach an agreement on something that is so complex,” says Rusten, especially given how enmeshed the nuclear issues are with a broader set of regional economic and security concerns. “There’s got to be an incremental, step by step approach.” "It’s somewhat surprising that they would play such high-stakes poker at such a high-profile event." Jenny Town, 38 North That should be especially evident given North Korea’s long history of failing to keep its nuclear promises. As much as Trump has touted denuclearization as the endgame, arms control experts widely agree that there’s likely no way to get there overnight, or in a single sit-down. What it will take is weeks or months or more of people on the ground hammering out fine details, not a single two-hour meeting between two heads of state. Especially when at least one of them likely has other things on his mind. And while Thursday’s failure could have been worse—Trump could have, say, promised to withdraw all US troops from South Korea, or Kim could have threatened to resume missile testing—it extracts a real cost. By trying for a grand bargain, Trump and Kim missed the opportunity to establish clear, specific goals that their teams could work then work towards. “It’s somewhat surprising that they would play such high-stakes poker at such a high-profile event,” says Jenny Town, analyst at North Korea watchdog 38 North. “It’s really hard to see how we might maintain momentum going forward.” Maintaining the status quo is preferable to more nuclear tests, but it’s not a viable long-term solution. “While it’s good that tensions are down, North Korea is continuing to churn out fissile material and produce weapons,” says Rusten. “The facts on the ground continue to change in a negative direction.” It’s admirable that Trump has made neutralizing the threat from North Korea a top priority. The relative calm of the last eight months shouldn’t be dismissed. But if the White House wants to make actual progress, it needs to put in the work before the next high-profile meeting. That’s one concession Trump, so far, seems unwilling to make. Today’s bombs are smaller in size but more powerful. They are also more likely to be delivered via intercontinental ballistic missiles, rather than dropped from aircraft. Here's how they've evolved into weapons that could wipe out entire cities.

---split---22.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/not-fast-house-oversight-democrats-pumping-brakes-interviews-trump-family-members---split---President Donald Trump points to the crowd after accepting the GOP nomination for president at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Behind him are, from left, daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, daughter in law Vanessa Trump, and son Donald Trump Jr. The president's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, implicated three of Trump’s children and Kushner in possible criminal activity Wednesday in a House Oversight Committee hearing. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) After Chairman Elijah Cummings suggested earlier this week that his House Committee on Oversight and Reform could try to schedule interviews with members of the Trump family, including the president’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka, some Democrats urged caution about making such moves. The president’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen implicated Trump’s family members in multiple crimes in his public testimony on Wednesday. Specifically, Cohen described Donald Jr. and Eric’s involvement in an illegal hush money scheme to buy the silence of two of the president’s former mistresses, onetime Playboy model Karen McDougal and pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford, better known by her stage name Stormy Daniels. But while some Democrats want to haul the rest of the family in front of congressional committees, some Democrats on Oversight have cautioned that public hearings with Trump’s children might not be the optimal forum to follow up on Cohen’s claims. “I think the optics of that are very dangerous. ... I think that could backfire,” Democratic Rep. Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia said on CNN Thursday of bringing in Trump’s children for public interviews. Cohen vs. the GOP: The many defenses for Trump Democratic investigators in the Oversight and Intelligence Committees, as well as numerous others, are ever mindful of not overplaying their hand in myriad probes of Trump’s business empire and conflicts of interest, the president’s 2016 campaign, and his possible ties to foreign countries. Trump and his Republican allies in the House are pushing hard on the message that House Democrats are so focused on tearing down Trump that they aren’t able to legislate. Democrats have said they can “walk and chew gum at the same time” by investigating charges of corruption in Trump’s administration and business history while also working on bipartisan bills in a divided government. For his part, Cummings is treading carefully, making sure he and his Oversight Committee staff methodically scrutinize the Cohen transcript and gather input from other Democratic members before planning their next move. “We’ll go through, we’ll figure out who we want to talk to and we’ll bring them in,” Cummings told reporters after the Cohen hearing Wednesday. But Democrats on the committee are sending him mixed signals. Some are eager to use their public stage to grill Donald Trump Jr. and possibly his siblings about allegations “What they’re doing is affecting the public, so it should be out in front of everyone so everyone knows what’s going on,” said Mike McQuerry, a senior aide for Oversight Committee Rep. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The committee’s goal is not “to bring people before the committee for a dog and pony show,” McQuerry noted. “The issue is, if you want to bring members of the family in, who do you bring and when do you bring them? You just have to be very practical and very smart about who you bring up here,” he said. But other lawmakers and aides have privately opined that not only could such a public spectacle backfire in view of everyday Americans — the need for heightened security measures could make such a hearing logistically infeasible. “The Secret Service would have to close down the entire [Rayburn House Office Building],” where the committee holds its hearings, one senior Democratic aide told Roll Call. That’s an exaggeration, of course, but the safety precautions for bringing in one of the president’s children for a public hearing could present a logistical nightmare for the U.S. Capitol Police and committee staff. Plus there’s the fact that the House Intelligence Committee, which interviewed Cohen on Thursday, already spoke with Donald Trump Jr. last Congress, when Republicans were in the majority. The new Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, has expressed interest in bringing Trump’s eldest son back for a follow-up interview. Democrats felt that the old Republican Chairman Devin Nunes, now the committee’s ranking member, cut their 2017 meeting with Trump Jr. short. The private nature of Intelligence Committee interviews also offers lawmakers the opportunity to ask witnesses questions that relate to ongoing Justice Department investigations and more sensitive government information — an advantage over the more public-facing Oversight Committee. Even with reporters lurking in the hallways outside the locked committee room and probing lawmakers for information as they come and go, Intel members tend to remain more tight-lipped about the testimony they receive from witnesses. Connolly and other Democrats have been quick to point out that they might not even need to bring in Trump’s sons to corroborate Cohen’s claims about the illegal hush money payments to McDougal and Clifford. There’s someone else who knows even more: Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. “He became interest number one. He’s the next one to come forward that people want to hear from,” one Democratic aide with knowledge of the deliberations told Roll Call after the Cohen hearing of a potential hearing with Weisselberg. Weisselberg has been a Trump ally for decades, dating back to when the president’s father, Fred Trump, was calling the shots. He has provided limited cooperation on the allegations surrounding the hush money payments to McDougal and Clifford as part of an immunity agreement with federal prosecutors in New York, according to NBC News reporting. “He knows everything.

---split---24.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-cohen-book-pitch-shows-he-committed-perjury-on-a-scale-not-seen-before---split---Michael Cohen, former attorney for President Donald Trump, testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) President Donald Trump on Friday demanded that lawmakers obtain a transcript of a book reportedly pushed by his former fixer Michael Cohen that paints a very different picture of his former client than he described to a House panel on Wednesday. The president also lodged a major allegation against Cohen, who already has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, saying he “committed perjury on a scale not seen before” during testimony this week. Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?  Cohen told the House Oversight and Reform Committee during a marathon hearing this week that Trump is a “con man,” a “cheat” and a “racist.” As the hearing plodded on, the former Trump personal attorney espoused allegations of campaign finance law violations, bank fraud, tax code violations, insurance fraud, 500 threats he made on Trump’s behalf and numerous lies the president has told, including about ending pursuit of a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 U.S. election. Watch: Cohen vs. the GOP: The many defenses for Trump Now, Trump is doing what he always does when backed into a corner: he’s fighting back. [3 takeaways: Trump-Kim collapse ‘a breakdown that ... didn’t need to happen’] The president appeared Friday morning to use a Daily Mail report as ammunition that began this way: “President Donald Trump is not crazy. Nor is he dumb or paranoid. Certainly he is not in over his head. Is he a liar? Nope. And he is not addicted to TV either. Who says so? None other than Michael Cohen.” The UK-based newspaper reported Cohen was floating a book proposal around New York last year before federal agents raided his office and residence before later indicting him in a case that soon will see him head to prison. That pitch reportedly painted a flattering picture of his then-client, a much different description than he laid out on Wednesday before a riveted Washington. Trump on Friday used a tweet to call the book proposal a “love letter to Trump” that amounts to the “exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!” The president called on lawmakers to “demand” a copy of however much of the book his former attorney might have penned before he began cooperating with federal law enforcement officials, including Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III. He told his followers their “heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!” Trump wrote in a second tweet, getting the day of the hearing incorrect. Trump, who arrived back at the White House Thursday night — after his denuclearization summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un collapsed — and accused Mueller of being unable to prove “collusion” between his 2016 campaign and Russia. So now, Democrats “say, ‘gee, I have an idea, let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let’s follow discredited Michael Cohen.......and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday.” Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a “love letter to Trump” manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!   Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen’s new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!  Democrats on the Oversight and Reform panel, joined by their Intelligence Committee counterparts, said this week Cohen’s testimony only opened new avenues of Trump’s business and political dealings they plan to investigate. And Mueller’s team, as well as federal investigators in New York’s Southern Division and New York state officials, all are continuing multiple investigations of all things Trump. [Trump blasts Cohen: ‘He lied so many times’ except about collusion] Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former U.S. attorney, told MSNBC on Thursday that he suspects the president’s real trouble is brewing in the Southern District. The longtime Trump ally suggested federal investigators there are preparing to charge the 45th president soon after he leaves office. Perhaps that is why Trump on Friday morning called for all those ongoing probes to end immediately. “No way, it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt,” he wrote. “Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!” Oh’ I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, “gee, I have an idea, let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let’s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....   ...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!  But by all indications 2019 and 2020 won’t just be about Trump’s case for re-election and the winnowing of the crowded Democratic field battling to face him in what promises to be another brutal general election campaign. What’s increasingly clear is the next 19 months and two days also will be about House Democrats’ digging into Trump’s alleged misdeeds and what federal and state officials uncover — and how much becomes public before voters head to the polls on Nov. 3, 2020.

Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption Julian Raven of Elmira, N.Y., stands in front of his 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump, inspired by a vision of Trump's potential restoration of America. The first thing you notice when you see it is that it's big, even huge. And isn't that appropriate? After all, it's a massive 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump. For Trump, it's gotta be big. "I paint large anyway," said the artist, Julian Raven of Elmira, N.Y. "It just happens that it works with Trump, as well." The president is making yet another appearance before the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Saturday, and one thing is clear – this is his crowd. "I like the president," said Alex Woods, 23, from Florida. Adding what he likes about Trump is "that he gets stuff done, keeps campaign promises, you know, gets straight to the point." For Woods, the point is building the wall. "But, like, see it would be political suicide for Democrats to support it," he said, "because they would lose the Spanish vote. What it's got to come down to is we're Americans, and it's got to be America first." A young supporter in the crowd wears a "Make America Great Again" hat. Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan is the clear message of the CPAC. Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption A young supporter in the crowd wears a "Make America Great Again" hat. Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan is the clear message of the CPAC. Gabrielle Lawrence, 20, from Maine said she supports the president because of the strong economy and also because she wants the wall built. "The wall is important," she said, "because I think it represents something really big, because we do have a big problem with illegal immigrants coming over." Patrick Ragozzine of Georgia graduated from high school last year and took the year off to work on a local state representative's campaign. He'll be a college freshman in the fall and said he came to CPAC to meet like-minded conservatives and to "show support for the president." Ragozzine said he likes the president's tax cuts, the conservative judges he has nominated and what he has been doing with immigration and border security. "I think that the direction our country has been moving in for the past 10 years isn't really the direction I want it to be moving in," he said. "So I want to come support the president and 'America first.' " CPAC has evolved over the years. Always a gathering place for young activists from across the country, the emphases have changed. The Republican Party is a three-legged stool made up of national security hawks, fiscal conservatives and social values conservatives. In years when George W. Bush was president, the hawks dominated. It was a place to rally the faithful behind the "global war on terror" following the 9/11 attacks. With Barack Obama in the White House, this was a hive of political candidates and activists trying to figure out the way forward. And it was, for a few years, dominated by the economic libertarian strain of Ron and Rand Paul. That has faded, superseded by the culture wars – abortion, immigration and warnings about the embrace of socialism (especially among young people). Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow told the crowd that he wanted to put socialism on trial and wanted them to "convict it." The pro-Trumpism here is punctuated by the red dots of "Make America Great Again" hats adorning young people in the crowd and the adopting of Trump's rhetoric. "Build the wall" and "America first" weren't part of these conservative activists' lexicon before Trump. But now those words on the tips of everyone's tongues. Talk in the hallways is of the wall (and beating Democrats). There's even a fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, on display. A fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, is on display with a quote by former President Ronald Reagan that reads: "A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation." Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption A fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, is on display with a quote by former President Ronald Reagan that reads: "A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation." Vice President Mike Pence appears before the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Friday. Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption Vice President Mike Pence appears before the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Friday. From the audience, it's hard to miss the theme of the conference, which is in bold block letters on stage — "What Makes America Great." From that stage, there's been talk of Democratic obstruction — from Elaine Chao, Trump's transportation secretary and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats are "invoking cloture at every step of the way," Chao said with seeming disbelief. She noted, "It's not the Senate majority leader's fault." McConnell set a record for use of the filibuster while in the minority in attempts to block Obama's policies and judges. CPAC organizers argue that Trump has come around to many of their positions and that not everything talked about here lines up cleanly with the president. There was, for example, a panel on reducing the national debt with Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia. The debt has gone up under Trump, and that's something far from the core philosophy of the Tea Party, to constrain spending. Republican Sen. David Perdue, who spoke about reducing the national debt, takes a selfie with a young MAGA supporter. Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption Republican Sen. David Perdue, who spoke about reducing the national debt, takes a selfie with a young MAGA supporter. Instead, it's the culture wars that now dominate. There was heavy talk of abortion from the main stage. Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America even proclaimed that Trump – Donald Trump – is "the most pro-life president in my lifetime." (That's despite the fact that Trump used to support abortion rights and the fact that abortion rights opponents, including CWA, have heaped praise on former President George W. Bush's many anti-abortion-rights policies.) Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker compared abortion to taking a baby home and killing it. For Raven, the painter, his artwork was inspired by a vision of Trump's potential restoration of America. Each brush stroke seemed to be full of symbolism. One of the tiny tears in the flag, for example, is a fetus, Raven pointed out. And there's a full-length wall in the painting along the border with Mexico. It includes a big, beautiful door. What's at the heart of why Raven, born in England and raised in Spain, chose to paint this? "When we depart from our Judeo-Christian values, the boundaries of right and wrong are lost," Raven said, adding, "People have lost respect for our country. The Latin countries, especially, think they can just march into our country. Show respect. We're, like, your neighbor. We don't want a wall; we have to have a wall." The 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump by artist Julian Raven is on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. Amr Alfiky/NPR hide caption The 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump by artist Julian Raven is on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. There is little dissent here with the president – save from some concern over the "precedent" it might set for Trump to have declared a national emergency. And few attendees bring up the debt. CPAC, as to be expected perhaps, has amounted to not much more than a pep rally, a corralling of the troops for the president's re-election bid. That's fairly typical at partisan political conferences the year before a president runs for re-election. In fact, the hottest debate might have been one in the hallways Thursday over how to pronounce MAGA, the acronym associated with Trump's slogan, Make America Great Again. "Why are we saying MAH-guh?" asked one attendee to another, patting him on the back and taking a photo. "Shouldn't it be MĂ [like mat]-guh?" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---33.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/#interactive---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Most still want U.S. as top global power, but see China on the rise By Richard Wike, Bruce Stokes, Jacob Poushter, Laura Silver, Janell Fetterolf and Kat Devlin America’s global image plummeted following the election of President Donald Trump, amid widespread opposition to his administration’s policies and a widely shared lack of confidence in his leadership. Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election approaches, a new 25-nation Pew Research Center survey finds that Trump’s international image remains poor, while ratings for the United States are much lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency. The poll also finds that international publics express significant concerns about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it used to. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well, including the fact that, while the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago. Even though America’s image has declined since Trump’s election, on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% offer an unfavorable rating. However, a median of only 27% say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs; 70% lack confidence in him. Frustrations with the U.S. in the Trump era are particularly common among some of America’s closest allies and partners. In Germany, where just 10% have confidence in Trump, three-in-four people say the U.S. is doing less these days to address global problems, and the share of the public who believe the U.S. respects personal freedoms is down 35 percentage points since 2008. In France, only 9% have confidence in Trump, while 81% think the U.S. doesn’t consider the interests of countries like France when making foreign policy decisions. Critical views are also widespread among America’s closest neighbors. Only 25% of Canadians rate Trump positively, more than six-in-ten (63%) say the U.S. is doing less than in the past to address global problems, and 82% think the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making policy. Meanwhile, Trump’s lowest ratings on the survey are found in Mexico, where just 6% express confidence in his leadership. One exception to this pattern is Israel. After a year in which the Trump administration generated international controversy by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, his positive rating jumped to 69%, up from 56% in 2017. Around the world, publics are divided about the direction of American power: Across the 25 nations surveyed, a median of 31% say the U.S. plays a more important role in the world today than it did ten years ago; 25% say it plays a less important role; and 35% believe the U.S. is as important as it was a decade ago. In contrast, views about Chinese power are clear: A median of 70% say China’s role on the world stage has grown over the past 10 years. Still, by a slim margin, more people name the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power (a median of 39% say the U.S., 34% say China). And despite the unease many feel about the U.S. at the moment, the idea of a U.S.-led world order is still attractive to most. When asked which would be better for the world, having China or the U.S. as the top global power, people in nearly every country tend to select the U.S., and this is particularly common among some of China’s Asia-Pacific neighbors, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Australia. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to Aug. 12, 2018. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 use additional data from a Pew Research Center survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted from May 14 to June 15, 2018. Although perceptions of the U.S. are on balance positive, they vary considerably among the nations surveyed. Ten of the 25 countries in this year’s survey are European Union member states, and across these EU nations a median of just 43% offer a favorable opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, half or more in four of the five Asia-Pacific nations polled give the U.S. a positive rating, including 83% in the Philippines, one of the highest ratings in the survey. The U.S. also gets high marks in South Korea, where 80% have a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in President Trump has increased over the past year from 17% to 44%. As has largely been the case since Pew Research Center’s first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, attitudes toward the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa are largely positive, with Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans expressing mostly favorable opinions in this year’s poll. The three Latin American nations polled offer differing views about the U.S., with Brazilians voicing mostly favorable reviews, while Argentines and Mexicans are mostly negative. And the two Middle Eastern nations in the study – Israel and Tunisia – offer strikingly different assessments. The country giving the U.S. its lowest rating in the survey, and the place where the biggest drop in U.S. favorability has taken place over the past year, is Russia. Just 26% of Russians have a favorable opinion of the U.S., compared with 41% in 2017. A 55% majority of Russians say relations have gotten worse in the past year, and the share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53% to 19%. The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders, and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five. A median of 70% across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews. In contrast, opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive. Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU, although there are regional divides within Europe, with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe. European attitudes toward Trump are strikingly negative, especially when compared with the ratings his predecessor received while in office. Looking at four European nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently since 2003 reveals a clear pattern regarding perceptions of American presidents. George W. Bush, whose foreign policies were broadly unpopular in Europe, got low ratings during his presidency, while the opposite was true for Barack Obama, who enjoyed strong approval in these four nations during his time in office. Following the 2016 election, confidence in the president plunged, with Trump’s ratings resembling what Bush received near the end of his second term (although Trump’s numbers are up slightly in the United Kingdom this year). In several European nations, Trump receives higher ratings from supporters of right-wing populist parties. For example, among people in the UK who have a favorable view of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), 53% express confidence in Trump, compared with only 21% among those with an unfavorable view of UKIP. Similar divides exist among supporters and detractors of right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. However, it is worth noting that, other than in the UK, there is no European country in which more than half of right-wing populist party supporters say they have confidence in Trump. A common criticism about American foreign policy over the past decade and a half has been that the U.S. only looks after its own interests in world affairs, ignoring the interests of other nations. As Pew Research Center surveys showed, this belief was especially prevalent during George W. Bush’s presidency, when many around the world thought the U.S. was pursuing unilateralist, and unpopular, policies. Strong opposition to the Iraq War and other elements of Bush’s foreign policy led to rising complaints about the U.S. acting alone and ignoring the interests and concerns of other nations. Opinions shifted following Barack Obama’s election, with more people saying the U.S. considers their country’s interest, although even during the Obama years the prevailing global sentiment was that the U.S. doesn’t necessarily consider other countries. Now, the Trump presidency has brought an increase in the number of people in many nations saying the U.S. essentially doesn’t listen to countries like theirs when making foreign policy. This pattern is especially pronounced among some of America’s top allies and partners. For instance, while the share of the French public who believe the U.S. considers their national interest has not been very high at any point over the past decade and a half, it reached a low point near the end of Bush’s second term (11% in 2007), rose somewhat during Obama’s presidency (35% in 2013) and has declined once more under Trump. Today, just 18% in France say the U.S. considers the interests of countries like theirs when making policy. America’s reputation as a defender of individual liberty has generally been strong in Pew Research Center surveys since we first started asking about it in 2008. The prevailing view among the publics surveyed has typically been that the U.S. government respects the personal liberties of its people, and that is true again in this year’s poll. However, this opinion has become less common over time, and the decline has been particularly sharp among key U.S. partners in Europe, North America and Asia. The decline began during the Obama administration following revelations about the National Security Agency’s electronic eavesdropping on communications around the world, and it has continued during the first two years of the Trump presidency. The drop is especially prominent in Western Europe, where the share of the public saying Washington respects personal freedom has declined sharply since 2013. The same pattern is found among several other U.S. allies as well, including Canada, where the percentage saying the U.S. respects individual freedom has dropped from 75% to 38% since 2013, and Australia, where it has gone from 72% to 45%. Respondents to the survey were read a list of seven major nations, and for each one, were asked whether they think it is playing a more important, less important, or as important of a role in the world compared with 10 years ago. Among the seven countries tested, China stands apart: A median of 70% across the nations polled say Beijing plays a more important role today than a decade ago. Half or more in 23 of 25 countries express this view. Many also say this about Russia. A median of 42% believe Moscow’s role on the world stage has grown over the past decade, and majorities hold this view in Greece, Israel, Tunisia and Russia itself. Overall, people are split on whether Germany’s role is greater than it was 10 years ago or about the same, but many in Europe see Germany’s role as more influential. On the other hand, Europeans are particularly likely to think the UK is less important now. There is no real consensus in views of America’s prominence in world affairs. A median of 35% believe it is as important as it was 10 years ago, while 31% say it is more important and 25% say less. Japan is the only country with a majority saying that Washington plays a less important role. Meanwhile, Israelis, Nigerians and Kenyans are particularly likely to think the U.S. is more important than it used to be. In addition to being asked about whether major powers are rising, falling or staying about the same, respondents were asked the following question about whether they would prefer the U.S. or China to be the top global power: “Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world: the U.S. is the world’s leading power or China is the world’s leading power?” Results show that the U.S. is overwhelmingly the top choice. The U.S. is named more often than China in every country surveyed except three: Argentina, Tunisia and Russia, although in many nations significant numbers volunteer that it would be good for the world if both or neither were the leading power. Some of America’s allies in Asia and elsewhere are particularly likely to prefer a future in which the U.S. is the top global power. Two-thirds or more hold this opinion in Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK.  Findings from Germany, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Israel illustrate key patterns and major differences in how foreign publics view the U.S. in 2018. Germany stands out as a country where America’s image is considerably more negative today than during the Barack Obama era. Whereas Obama was extremely popular in Germany (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA scandal), only around one-in-ten Germans have voiced confidence in Trump in each of the past two years, ratings similar to those registered for George W. Bush at the end of his second term. Germany stands out on other measures as well. It is the country with the highest percentage (80%) saying relations with the U.S. have deteriorated over the past year, and it is tied with Sweden for the largest share of the public (75%) saying the U.S. is doing less to confront global problems. Germany is also where the biggest declines have taken place in recent years regarding the belief that the U.S. respects personal freedom and that Washington listens to other countries in international affairs. Mexico is where Trump gets his lowest ratings on the survey: Just 6% in the United States’ southern neighbor have confidence in him. Last year, more than nine-in-ten Mexicans opposed Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year, 66% in Mexico say relations have gotten worse over the past 12 months. Just 39% of Canadians express a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2018, the lowest percentage since Pew Research Center began polling in Canada in 2002. Only 25% have confidence in Trump, although he gets more positive ratings among those who feel closest to the Conservative Party (44%) than among those who identify with the New Democratic Party (17%) or the ruling Liberal Party (10%). Fully 82% say the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making foreign policy. Japanese trust in the U.S. president has also suffered under Donald Trump, but America’s overall image has not. In 2018, just three-in-ten Japanese say they have confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs, a slight improvement over their view in 2017, but significantly lower than their views of the U.S. president throughout the Obama administration. Opinion of Trump is comparable to sentiment about George W. Bush during his time in office. Fully 67% of Japanese, however, have a favorable view of the U.S., up 10 percentage points from last year. Despite the high ratings for the U.S., there are concerns in Japan about the trajectory of American power – it is the only country where a majority (55%) believes the U.S. is less powerful than 10 years ago. Confidence in President Trump has increased significantly in Israel since 2017. Trump also receives substantially higher ratings than Obama got near the end of his second term, although they are very similar to the high ratings for Obama in 2014, before tensions rose between his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. As has been the case in recent years, around eight-in-ten Israelis express a favorable opinion about the U.S. At 52%, Israelis are more likely than any other public surveyed to say the U.S. is doing more to address global problems than a few years ago. Israel also tops the list in terms of the share of the public (79%) saying that relations with the U.S. have improved in the past year. The rest of the report delves into these and other findings in more detail. Chapter 1 explores overall attitudes toward the U.S., America’s approach to foreign policy, whether the U.S. government respects individual liberty, and relations between survey countries and the U.S. Chapter 2 examines ratings for President Trump and other world leaders. Chapter 3 looks at opinions regarding whether specific major nations are playing a more or less important role in world affairs than in the past. Chapter 4 explores views about the balance of power between the U.S. and China, while Chapter 5 examines China’s global image.

---split---35.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-summit.html---split---Supported by By David E. Sanger and Edward Wong HANOI, Vietnam — As President Trump settled into the dining room of a French-colonial hotel in Hanoi on Thursday morning, the conversation with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader with whom he had struck up the oddest of friendships, was already turning tense. In a dinner at the Metropole Hotel the evening before, mere feet from the bomb shelter where guests took cover during the Vietnam War, Mr. Kim had resisted what Mr. Trump presented as a grand bargain: North Korea would trade all its nuclear weapons, material and facilities for an end to the American-led sanctions squeezing its economy. An American official later described this as “a proposal to go big,’’ a bet by Mr. Trump that his force of personality, and view of himself as a consummate dealmaker, would succeed where three previous presidents had failed. But Mr. Trump’s offer was essentially the same deal that the United States has pushed — and the North has rejected — for a quarter century. Intelligence agencies had warned him, publicly, Mr. Kim would not be willing to give up the arsenal completely. North Korea itself had said repeatedly that it would only move gradually. Several of Mr. Trump’s own aides, led by national security adviser John R. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thought the chances of a grand bargain for total nuclear disarmament were virtually zero. Some questioned whether the summit meeting should go forward. Mr. Trump disagreed. He had taken to showing what he called Mr. Kim’s “beautiful letters” to visitors to the Oval Office, as evidence he had built a rapport with one of the world’s most brutal dictators. While some in the White House worried Mr. Trump was being played, the president seemed entranced — even declaring “we fell in love.” As Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim parted company, nearly a year of optimism and flattery was left poolside at the Metropole, steps from a meeting room with two empty chairs and flags that had been carefully prepared for a “signing ceremony.” Mr. Trump and senior diplomats say they hope negotiations will continue, though nothing has been scheduled. Mr. Kim has promised not to resume weapons testing, and the Pentagon continues to hold off on large-scale military exercises with South Korea. In interviews with a half-dozen participants, it is clear Mr. Trump’s failed gambit was the culmination of two years of threats, hubris and misjudgment on both sides. Mr. Trump entered office convinced he could intimidate the man he liked to call “Little Rocket Man” with tough talk and sanctions, then abruptly took the opposite tack, overruling his aides and personalizing the diplomacy. Mr. Kim also miscalculated. He bet Mr. Trump might accept a more modest offer that American negotiators in Hanoi had already dismissed: The North would dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear complex, three square miles of aging facilities at the heart of the nuclear program, for an end to the sanctions most harmful to its economy, those enacted since 2016. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump was tempted to take that deal, which could have turned headlines away from the damaging testimony of his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in Washington. But Mr. Pompeo, who knew the details of the North Korean program intimately from his days as C.I.A. director, opposed it. The president was told that if he settled for Yongbyon alone, he might appear to have been duped by the young leader of a country renowned for hiding pieces of its nuclear program in tunnels around the country. Mr. Pompeo said later that Mr. Kim’s offer “still leaves missiles, still leaves warheads and weapons systems” — and a senior State Department official argued that sanctions relief would fund the production of more weapons. It also would have let the North continue to produce uranium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, at a hidden enrichment center near the capital, Pyongyang — one of several suspected nuclear sites beyond Yongbyon that the United States has been monitoring from afar for nearly a decade. “I think that they were surprised that we knew,” Mr. Trump said. In the end, the president took a brief walk with Mr. Kim around the hotel’s pool, shook his hand and then canceled lunch in a glassed pavilion. “This kind of opportunity may never come again,” Ri Yong-ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, told reporters later that night. For a president who often complains that his predecessors only let the North Korea problem fester, the 8,000-mile trek from Washington to Hanoi was a crash course in why those past presidents failed. Many around Mr. Trump believe he will, too. North Korea was the first international crisis of the Trump administration, and discussion about how hard to press the country sometimes got heated. At one point, aides said they heard Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, shouting at each other behind closed doors. Gen. McMaster was intent on signaling to both North Korea and allies that Mr. Trump was serious about enforcing sanctions and that he would not tolerate a nuclear North Korea. In a series of Situation Room meetings, the administration reviewed options to ramp up sanctions and covert operations, including an Obama-era program of cyber sabotage against North Korean missiles. War plans were rewritten, and Gen. McMaster spoke openly about the possibility of a “preventive war” if the threat grew. The shouting was prompted by Gen. McMaster’s insistence that Mr. Mattis intercept North Korean ships on the high seas to determine whether they were engaged in sanctions busting. But Mr. Mattis resisted, worried that a the outbreak of a firefight at sea could quickly escalate out of control. Mr. Kim, for his part, turned up the pressure, launching missile after missile, including new intercontinental ballistic models that appeared capable of hitting the United States. There was also another nuclear test, which some experts believe may have been a hydrogen bomb, as the North claimed. But for more than a year, Mr. Trump shut down efforts at diplomacy. When Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state at the time, told reporters during a visit to Beijing that “we have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang,” Mr. Trump lashed out, declaring on Twitter that “only one thing will work” and casting his own secretary of state as naïve. Mr. Tillerson fumed and was later ousted. Early in 2018, though, Mr. Trump suddenly changed course — along the lines Mr. Tillerson had advocated. To the shock of Mr. Trump’s own advisers, he accepted on the spot when envoys sent by South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, passed on an invitation to meet Mr. Kim. After that first summit meeting in Singapore in June, the talk of hostilities ended. Mr. Trump declared Mr. Kim an honorable partner — gliding past the murder of his half brother, his uncle and an American student in North Korea, Otto Wambier — and promised to improve relations and suspend military exercises around Korea. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,” Mr. Trump declared on Twitter, despite the absence of any timetable for denuclearization. Some of his aides, starting with Mr. Bolton, the new national security adviser, were appalled. But with Mr. Trump repeating that he should be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, no one wanted to argue. Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own. There were signs of trouble from the start. Mr. Pompeo flew to Pyongyang in early July to turn the Singapore discussion into a timetable for the North to produce an inventory of weapons, the first step toward disarmament, but Mr. Kim declined to see him. Instead, Mr. Pompeo met with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief with hard-line views on the United States. After the visit, the North said the Americans had pushed a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization.” But it also said Kim Jong-un still wanted to build on the “friendly relationship and trust” with Mr. Trump. The message was clear: A real breakthrough was only possible if the two leaders got together again. The North Koreans seemed to believe Mr. Kim could get a better deal from Mr. Trump than they could from his State Department negotiators. Then in August, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a trip by Mr. Pompeo to Pyongyang, saying there had not been enough progress in the talks. This stymied the new special envoy, Stephen E. Biegun, who had planned to accompany Mr. Pompeo. Meanwhile, diplomacy between South Korea and North Korea was progressing quickly. Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim had already met twice before the Singapore summit, and in September, Mr. Moon made a historic visit to Pyongyang. The result was the Pyongyang Declaration, which outlined a peace process for the peninsula — and dangled a potential concession by North Korea. The North, it said, would agree to dismantle the Yongbyon complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.” Suddenly, Yongbyon was in play. But what did North Korea want? Some analysts said they believed then that the North was seeking an end-of-war declaration as a prelude to legally replacing the armistice that halted the Korean War, an idea that Mr. Trump told Mr. Kim in Singapore he supported. And Mr. Moon was pushing for the end-of-war declaration. American officials were worried it could lead too quickly to a peace treaty and then negotiations to draw down the 28,500 American troops on the peninsula — a longtime goal of the North. Then, a few days before the midterm elections in the United States, North Korea released a belligerent statement that said the country would return to a policy of strengthening its nuclear force if the United States did not lift sanctions. In retrospect, it was an important message that was obscured by the discussion of an end-of-war declaration. What really mattered to Mr. Kim were the sanctions, which, after three new rounds in 2017, were strangling his nation’s already pitiful economy. The United States had even cut off critical humanitarian aid to the country by barring American aid groups from traveling there. With diplomacy stalled, Mr. Trump decided to weigh in again. Mr. Bolton announced in December that Mr. Trump wanted another summit meeting in early 2019 because North Korea had “not lived up to the commitments” it made in Singapore. To some diplomats and analysts, that seemed like a reason not to meet again. The North Koreans appointed a former ambassador to Spain, Kim Hyok-chol, to lay the groundwork with Mr. Biegun, 55, a pragmatic former senior aide to Condoleezza Rice in the Bush administration who had been passed over for the national security adviser position in favor of Mr. Bolton. The first meetings in Pyongyang did not go smoothly. And when the two sides met in Hanoi starting six days before the summit meeting, the North Koreans kept demanding that the five most recent rounds of sanctions imposed by the United Nations since March 2016 be lifted. Mr. Ri, the foreign minister, said later that North Korea chose those sanctions because they affected ordinary citizens. These sanctions, imposed to punish Pyongyang for new weapons tests, differed from previous restrictions that were focused on weapons and nuclear-related equipment. Instead, they covered entire export sectors, including minerals, metals, coal, agriculture and seafood. They also banned energy sales to North Korea. Altogether, they held back billions of dollars of trade, a senior State Department official said. The far-reaching nature of the sanctions — and the suffering they were causing — were exactly why hard-line administration officials wanted to keep them up. After Mr. Trump’s surprise decision at Singapore to suspend military exercises with South Korea, these officials worried the United States was losing leverage. That camp, led by Mr. Bolton, regarded Mr. Pompeo and his diplomats with suspicion. Would they give away too much for too little? Would they give in to the North Korean entreaties to loosen sanctions? A Stanford speech by Mr. Biegun in January appeared to the hawks to be a red flag: He suggested then that North Korea might not need to immediately hand over a complete declaration of nuclear assets, which American officials had demanded as a first step. But behind closed doors, Mr. Biegun and his team told the North Koreans that giving up the aging facilities at Yongbyon was not nearly enough for such extensive sanctions relief. At the same time, the North Korean negotiators were inconsistent about which of the facilities inside Yongbyon they were offering to dismantle — at one point saying that only Kim Jong-un could decide. The negotiating teams were still deadlocked even as Mr. Kim boarded a train for a two-day journey to Vietnam and Mr. Trump took off on Air Force One. The American team thought their North Korean counterparts would warn Mr. Kim that the demand to lift the five sanctions was a non-starter, so the two leaders would work on hashing something else out during the summit meeting. But soon after the two men arrived at the Metropole, the North Korean leader began arguing for relief from the five rounds of sanctions in exchange for Yongbyon. Mr. Trump countered with the grand bargain. The divide was underscored by the fact that, at one point, he presented Mr. Kim with a document laying out his definition of denuclearization. Mr. Kim objected that there was not enough trust between the two countries to give up everything at once. At a rare news conference shortly after midnight on Thursday, Mr. Ri argued that his country mostly needed “security guarantees” related to American military forces on the peninsula, and portrayed the sanctions-for-Yongbyon trade as a step to build trust. In the end, Mr. Trump flew back to Washington with nothing — no agreement on a peace declaration, and no ban on producing more nuclear fuel — meaning the North’s arsenal will keep expanding while the two sides argue. There were only promises to keep talking. On Friday, as Mr. Trump woke up in the White House after his grueling trip, the long wooden table that had been moved into a meeting room of the Metropole Hotel for the signing ceremony still sat there, unused. Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea. Advertisement

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption Michael Cohen, former attorney and fixer for President Trump, is not the only Trump associate whom lawmakers probably want to interview. Michael Cohen was just the beginning. President Trump's former personal lawyer named names when he testified before the House oversight committee on Wednesday. He told the panel about Trump Organization personnel with knowledge of what Cohen alleged are criminal or questionable actions within the business. Cohen's knowledge about the inner workings of the Trump Organization is expansive. The former lawyer, now disbarred in the state of New York, once maintained an office close to Trump's in New York City's Trump Tower. Now congressional Democrats are turning their attention to other figures in the Trump Organization. Here are the names you need to know. Felix Sater Felix Sater (center) attends the Trump Soho Hotel Condominium launch party in New York in September 2007. Sater is scheduled to testify before Congress on March 14. Will Ragozzino/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images hide caption Felix Sater (center) attends the Trump Soho Hotel Condominium launch party in New York in September 2007. Sater is scheduled to testify before Congress on March 14. Sater is a real estate developer and longtime Trump business associate who was involved in the Trump Organization's efforts to build a Trump Tower project in Moscow. He is scheduled to testify in an open hearing before the House intelligence committee on March 14. Sater is notable for his previous connections to organized crime and the work he also has reportedly done on behalf of the U.S. government as an undercover informant. It was Sater who suggested to Cohen and Trump that one way to clear the way for Trump Tower in Moscow might be to offer Russian President Vladimir Putin a free penthouse, according to Cohen. Republicans battered Cohen over his credibility, and they are likely to do the same with Sater, a man from whom Trump has tried in the past to distance himself.

Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg (center) stands behind then-President-elect Donald Trump and his son Don Jr. on Jan. 11, 2017, at Trump Tower in New York. The chief financial officer of the Trump Organization has been a key player in all of Trump's business and other dealings. Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr., for example, signed one of the checks repaying Cohen for the money Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet ahead of Election Day in 2016. Weisselberg is so important to the investigations of Trump that prosecutors in Manhattan have reportedly offered him immunity in order to get his cooperation with their efforts. So it may be some time before the Justice Department could authorize him to talk to Congress — but that isn't stopping lawmakers from asking for him. "Mr. Weisselberg is a relevant witness for many committees — he knows where the money in the Trump Organization went to, and, you know, money that came in," Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told NPR. "We have a Trump Organization that, for a very long time, has wanted to do business in Russia and has also had Russians invest in Trump Tower in the United States. ... So it's to really find out if this president is financially compromised by the Russians." David Pecker, Barry Levine and Dylan Howard David Pecker, chairman and CEO of American Media, would have AMI "catch and kill" stories that might be embarrassing for Donald Trump. Marion Curtis/AP hide caption Trump is said to have enlisted a number of people to help with his alleged dirty work, including those who didn't work directly for him, Cohen said. Trump's friend David Pecker, for example, CEO of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, would have AMI "catch and kill" stories that might be embarrassing for Trump by paying people involved for the exclusive rights to them — but never publishing them. Sometimes Trump reimbursed AMI but sometimes he didn't, Cohen said — which made Pecker angry. That's what happened with former Playboy model Karen McDougal before Election Day in 2016, when Trump's camp feared she might talk publicly about the sexual relationship she said she had had with Trump. (Trump has denied ever having any such relationship with McDougal or with Daniels.) AMI bought McDougal's "life rights." AMI later entered into an agreement with prosecutors in New York in which it escaped charges in exchange for cooperating with the investigation. But there was evidently a great deal more to the relationship between Trump and Pecker/AMI than the McDougal case, Cohen said. Pecker's company worked many times to buy embarrassing stories about Trump, even ones that weren't true, which enabled AMI to compile a "treasure trove" of potentially damaging material. Cohen was so interested in what AMI had accumulated that when Pecker was negotiating to potentially take another important publishing job, Cohen wanted to buy the Trump archive on behalf of his client to ensure it was kept safe. Who else would know about the "treasure trove" and these practices? Former National Enquirer editor Barry Levine would, Cohen said, as well as a vice president of AMI, Dylan Howard. Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, seen at President Trump's January 2017 inauguration, were both briefed repeatedly on a potential Trump Tower Moscow project, according to former lawyer Michael Cohen. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, seen at President Trump's January 2017 inauguration, were both briefed repeatedly on a potential Trump Tower Moscow project, according to former lawyer Michael Cohen. The president's three oldest children are among his top advisers and have been a part of all the family's major business dealings, Cohen told lawmakers. That includes the potential Trump Tower Moscow real estate project. Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Trump Jr. both were briefed about it repeatedly, Cohen said. The chairman of the House oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said that Americans following these investigations should follow the names Cohen gave and also that his panel would be interested in interviewing them. It isn't clear whether Cummings actually has requested to hear from Ivanka or Donald Trump Jr., but the oversight committee chairman did complain on Friday that other requests for interviews and documents from the White House have received only silence. Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari Matthew Calamari, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, was among those named who could speak to the alleged inflation of the value of assets held by Trump or his companies. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Lieberman is an executive vice president in Trump's company who's responsible for managing many of its subsidiary enterprises, according to his Bloomberg bio. That includes modeling agencies, real estate and golf courses, and it was in discussing these operations that his name came up in Cohen's testimony, along with that of chief operating officer Calamari. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked Cohen about practices he had described involved with inflating the value of assets held by Trump or his companies. Sometimes Trump overstated the value of his properties to make them appear more valuable and himself seem more wealthy, Cohen said. Sometimes, Cohen said, Trump submitted information to authorities that made his properties seem much less valuable than they actually were, reducing the amount in taxes he would have to pay. So did Trump ever give inflated information about his assets to an insurance company, Ocasio-Cortez asked — something that could violate the law? Yes, Cohen said. When asked who could give the committee more information, he recommended Weisselberg, Lieberman and Calamari. If Cummings' comments were any indication, they may all soon have their time under the spotlight. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.
