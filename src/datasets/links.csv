They “fight crime, they right wrongs, they wear white but they’re not all white, and we love them. They’re the women of Congress!” Kate McKinnon as “Madam Clap-Back” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi zooms along on a Jet Ski in her introduction.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-foreign-minister_us_5c606529e4b0f9e1b17e5239---split---A Saudi Arabian foreign affairs official claimed Sunday that journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder was “a mistake” committed by Saudi government officials who had acted “outside their scope of authority.” Adel al-Jubeir, the country’s minister of state for foreign affairs, a top official in the foreign ministry, continued to claim Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) had no involvement in the October slaying of Khashoggi, despite the CIA’s determination that he was behind it. “The death of Jamal Khashoggi was a massive tragedy,” al-Jubeir told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “It was a mistake. It was committed by officials of the Saudi government acting outside their scope of authority.” He continued: “We have said we will investigate. We will hold those responsible accountable and we will punish them. The crown prince had nothing to do with this. There was no order given to murder Jamal Khashoggi. And the whole country is shocked by this.” Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs @AdelAljubeir says the murder of Jamal Khashoggi “was a mistake committed by officials of the Saudi government acting outside their scope of authority” pic.twitter.com/gfA1RC4SDV President Donald Trump, rejecting his own intelligence officials’ findings, has apparently chosen to believe MBS’ claim that he played no role in the gruesome murder of Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi royal family who was killed after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Both the CIA and Turkish investigators say MBS personally ordered the assassination, yet Trump announced in November that the U.S. would not end its alliance with the Middle Eastern kingdom. Saudi Arabia purportedly conducted an investigation into Khashoggi’s murder which resulted in the arrests of 18 Saudis, including 15 operatives who had allegedly acted as the hit squad. “What I tell people is wait until the legal process plays out and then judge us,” al-Jubeir told CBS. “Don’t judge us before the process is complete.” But Saudi Arabia has a long history of detaining and murdering dissidents. More than 60 people, many of whom are believed to be human rights activists, were arrested in May 2017 alone by the Saudi government during a wave of detentions, according to a January 2018 report released by two leading international human rights lawyers. The New York Times on Friday published a report that alleged MBS had told an aide in 2017 that he would “use a bullet” on Khashoggi. Asked about the report Sunday, al-Jubeir declined to comment. “I’m not going to comment on reports based on anonymous sources,” he said. “I don’t know the background.” Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs @AdelAljubeir says he doesn’t yet know where Jamal Khashoggi’s body is: “We are still investigating...I would expect that eventually we will find the truth” pic.twitter.com/J1MhBliu2J Al-Jubeir claimed Saudi investigators still don’t know the location of Khashoggi’s body. Turkish officials have said Khashoggi’s attackers dissolved his body in acid in an attempt to hide evidence of his murder. “We are still investigating,” he told CBS. “We have a number of possibilities, and we’re asking what [the alleged murderers] did with the body, and I think this investigation is ongoing.” Al-Jubeir previously served as Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister from 2015 until December 2018, when he was demoted to the rank of minister of state for foreign affairs as part of MBS’ sweeping overhaul of his cabinet. Ibrahim al-Assaf, formerly a longtime finance minister, took over the position. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that al-Jubeir is not Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister but its minister of state for foreign affairs.

During her rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Warren touted her support for increasing the minimum wage and Medicare for All. In a blog post Thursday, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos alleged that lawyers for the National Enquirer's parent company – American Media Inc. – tried to blackmail him into getting the Post to drop its investigation into the company's ties to Trump. And now a legal fight with the world’s richest person could prove devastating for American Media, a company that has faced financial challenges confronting even mainstream newspapers. A lawyer for American Media's CEO on Sunday defended the company's correspondence with Bezos, saying it did nothing illegal. And, of course, the cast of "Saturday Night Live" couldn't resist skewering Bezos in a sketch this weekend. The Grammys will debut new rules this year, expanding its biggest categories from five nominees to eight. The result? Highly diverse races for awards such as album of the year, which has no clear front-runner. The Grammys will air Sunday on CBS, beginning at 8 p.m. EST/5 p.m. PST, offering streaming options online. Don't count on seeing Beyonce, Taylor Swift and Drake in the audience, all artists who got snubbed and may not attend. The second woman to come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault also alleged she was raped by a Duke basketball player, and on Friday night a university spokesperson told USA TODAY that school officials were “looking into” the allegation. Meredith Watson, in a statement released earlier Friday by her lawyer, said Fairfax committed a “premeditated and aggressive” sexual assault of Watson while both were students at Duke in 2000. Fairfax appeared headed on a political collision course Sunday after a state delegate from his own party pledged to introduce articles of impeachment Monday if the 39-year-old Democrat refused to resign. Also over the weekend: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam sidestepped calls for his resignation, instead saying in his first interview since he admitted to wearing blackface that he would spend the rest of his time in office focused on mending racial tensions. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that, whatever Congress may or may not propose in a border security compromise, President Donald Trump will get his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. "The president is going to build the wall," Mulvaney said on "Fox News Sunday." "But this is going to get built with or without Congress." Mulvaney's words come as another potential government shutdown looms. Lawmakers have until Friday to craft a deal that the president would sign on to. You won't be seeing Prince Philip behind the wheel anymore.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-push-to-legalize-magic-mushrooms-for-depression-and-ptsd/---split---Backchannel is moving to Wired! Here's what that means: http://trib.al/Ar1TZSg When Todd’s psychiatrist suggested he start taking psychedelics, he figured it was a joke. It wasn’t. The former corporate executive from Colorado retired in 2006 after an MRI revealed his spine was riddled with a dozen tumors called hemangiomas, which later spread to his brain. Todd was told he would die before the end of 2008. Somehow, Todd has survived—he credits medical marijuana, which he now uses daily—but he is still considered terminal. “It could be tomorrow. It could be five years from now,” he says in a call. However, the 54-year-old spent the past decade plagued by a host of mental health problems, including PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. He was suicidal and tormented by violent night terrors. Nothing, not even massive doses of Xanax or Valium, could temper his panic attacks or end-of-life anxiety. “My mental condition was deteriorating rapidly, and I was on [antidepressant] medication No. 14 and it wasn’t working,” Todd says. “My psychiatrist said, ‘I honestly think you're a big candidate for psychedelics.’” That was about a year ago. Todd began taking homegrown psilocybin, the highly illegal alkaloid in so-called magic mushrooms. Known for prompting profound hallucinations, psilocybin was placed in the restrictive Schedule I category in 1970, meaning the US government recognizes no medical use for the drug and says that it carries a high risk of abuse. Todd says there have been clear benefits from psilocybin with few side effects. He hasn’t had a single PTSD episode since he began taking it. His depression evaporated. The mushrooms even help ease the pain—agony that feels like being “shot in the back”—from the nerve-crushing tumors in his spine and skull. “It’s knocked that out, it’s wiped that slate clean,” Todd says. The day before we talked, he’d eaten eight grams of fungus. A heavy dose is considered five grams, so this was no psychedelic snack—but Todd ingests this much about every week. The experience is positively hypnagogic, allowing trippers to enter a dreamlike conscious state where time is distorted, color is amplified, and depth perception is warped. Euphoric, unbridled laughter is common, as are oddly introspective thoughts about existence and reality, and even synesthetic sensations, such as being able to “see” sounds. A trip can last four to six hours. There can be negative effects as well, such as nausea, dizziness, paranoia, or panic attacks, but Todd doesn’t experience those. He still takes 10 milligrams of escitalopram, an antidepressant, and when the mushrooms wear off, 30 milligrams of the opioid oxycodone, but otherwise his prescription drug intake has drastically decreased. Todd asked me not to use his real name, fearful that his health insurance provider could sever benefits because he uses illicit substances. But his doctors are aware and supportive of his psychedelic drug use, he says, which may legally exempt him under the federal Right To Try Act for terminally ill patients, signed by President Trump last May. Indeed, magic mushrooms are having a therapeutic moment. In North America, at least four organizations, each with unique strategies, are working to expand access to psilocybin for anyone with mental health issues, dying or not. These groups hope to undo decades of psilocybin prohibition by removing criminal penalties for possession or cultivation, or by providing access to psilocybin in a therapist’s offices, or both. They cite a small but growing body of research suggesting psychedelic drugs can, in fact, be medically beneficial with low potential for addiction or abuse. Some small studies suggest that psilocybin can alleviate obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, end-of-life anxiety, addiction, cluster headaches, and, yes, relieve pain. There’s also growing evidence that ingesting the drug can promote optimism and prosocial and mystical worldviews, and nurture well-being. In just a few years, pockets of psilocybin-legal jurisdictions could appear, following the similar path that medical marijuana took to mainstream acceptance. The leaders of this movement include Compass Pathways, a UK startup developing psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression in North America and Europe. There are also two psilocybin grassroots movements, one in Oregon and another in Denver. If voters approve the Oregon Psilocybin Service Initiative in 2020, the state would develop a licensed psilocybin therapist industry and lower criminal penalties for growing or consuming mushrooms. Denver city voters may also get to decide whether to decriminalize personal possession and use of mushrooms—a voter initiative just gathered enough signatures to appear on the May ballot. Finally, there’s TheraPsil, a group of seven Canadian health care professionals who formally announced their intent to challenge the illegality of psilocybin by petitioning Health Canada to allow access to mushrooms in a medical setting for terminal patients. These little saprophytes—organisms that devour dead or decaying organic matter—are indeed enjoying a resurgence in popularity. But there are still numerous obstacles before psilocybin goes from black market hallucinogen to psychedelic medicine. The Swiss chemical company Sandoz began in 1886 as a dye manufacturer, later pivoting to pharmaceuticals. But in 1947, with the help of one of their lead scientists, Albert Hofmann, the business began producing a psychiatric drug they called Delysid. Most people know it as LSD. The psychedelic showed promise for treating mental health problems, but an LSD trip can last eight to 12 hours, so Sandoz sought a shorter-acting alternative. In 1958 Hofmann became the first to isolate psilocybin from mushrooms, subsequently developing a synthetic version called Indocybin. He first tried it on himself. Indocybin was safely marketed from 1961 until a rising cultural backlash against psychedelics led Sandoz to discontinue sales in 1966. Now, more than 50 years later, a company is looking to pick up where Sandoz left off. Compass Pathways was founded in 2016 by George Goldsmith and Ekaterina Malievskaia, a married couple from London with little experience in the pharmaceutical industry. When their son developed treatment-resistant depression and OCD, they were desperate for help. “The more they were treating him, the worse he was getting,” Malievskaia says in a call. So they took matters into their own hands. They began looking into scientific reports that psilocybin can rapidly reverse symptoms of depression for patients who have tried other approaches without results. And unlike Todd, these patients took only a single dose, not one per week. Compass, which has reaped about $31.5 million in Series A investment, is conducting two studies to see how viable psilocybin is for psychotherapy. The first, due to finish in early 2019, is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial planned with 90 healthy volunteers to evaluate cognitive and emotional function. The study is also helping to train Compass’ therapists. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted the company “breakthrough” therapy status for its second study, giving Compass priority review, following approval in August of a phase IIB clinical trial, designed to establish proper dosing. The study is recruiting 216 participants across North America and Europe, making it the largest clinical psilocybin trial to date. Patients meet with a therapist to prepare, then are later given synthetic psilocybin, which can cost upward of $7,000 per gram, while being monitored for the duration of the trip. Afterward, the therapist helps patients process the experience. If successful, these trials could lead to psilocybin therapy becoming legal in the US by 2021. Compass began as a nonprofit, but after realizing this research could cost an estimated $300 million, the company shifted to a for-profit model. That transition and other moves have drawn sharp criticism from some in the psychedelic community. A Quartz article published in November aired the concerns of numerous critics of Compass, who claimed that the company was backed by dubious investors and was attempting to monopolize magic mushrooms. About a quarter of Compass is owned by Atai Life Sciences, a biopharmaceutical startup founded in 2018 by entrepreneur Christian Angermayer. One of Atai’s backers is PayPal cofounder and tech mogul Peter Thiel, who has come under fire for helping bankrupt Gawker via a lawsuit, donating money to President Trump, and selling surveillance tech to various governments for countering terrorism and policing migrants. Malievskaia dismisses the criticism of Thiel. He has no say in Compass’ business operations, she says. “Peter is not one of the major investors. Personally, I think it's an excellent use of his money,” she says. “We don't screen investors based on their political convictions or what skeletons they have in their closets … It’s an equal-opportunity investment, and we are in charge of our mission, vision, execution.” Because it occurs in nature, it’s not possible to patent psilocybin, but it is legal to patent a synthetic manufacturing process, which Compass has done. To manufacture psilocybin in large quantities, they solved about 60 different technical problems, a project that cost about $750,000, according to Malievskaia. Switching to a for-profit strategy was a “very logical development,” she says. But some have interpreted this as Compass trying to corner the psilocybin market or prevent others from researching it. “It doesn't mean that we patented psilocybin as a molecule,” Malievskaia says. “Anyone can make it in many different ways: 3D printing, growing on yeast, genetic engineering … This is not blocking anyone. Investigators who want to use our product, we share it free of charge in exchange of providing safety data.” While the US federal government has long held that psilocybin is dangerous, scientific evidence says otherwise. In the November issue of Neuropharmacology, a team of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine researchers argued that under the Controlled Substances Act’s own criteria, psilocybin should not be Schedule I but the much less restrictive Schedule IV. The grassroots movements in Oregon and Denver are citing this and other research in the hopes of removing local penalties for using or growing mushrooms. The first to appear was the Oregon Psilocybin Society, founded by married therapist couple Tom and Sheri Eckert of Beaverton, who were inspired by—what else?—a personal mushroom experience. Their initiative would not only drastically reduce penalties for using or possessing psilocybin, it would create a state framework for therapists to become licensed psilocybin administrators, not too unlike Compass. In other words, you wouldn’t be able to walk into an Oregon Circle K and get an eighth of shrooms. But if you believed that psilocybin, synthetic or from mushrooms, could help your mental health—or heck, even if you were just curious about what the experience is like—there’d be options. Getting insurance to cover it would be another issue entirely, of course. The state attorney general recently approved OPS’s ballot title, so they now have until July 2020 to gather about 117,000 signatures. Then, during the next presidential election, Oregon voters will decide if this program is right for them. OPS hired a marketing research firm to test the waters and found that 47 percent of voters were in favor of their campaign with 46 percent opposed. That number rose to 64 percent when pollsters explained details about the initiative, with 54 percent in support of decriminalization. So far, OPS has experienced no opposition, they say, but anticipate some backlash once the question is on the ballot. “We suspect that Big Pharma is not gonna like this idea,” Sheri says in a call. “If you can treat an individual and it actually heals them and they no longer need to be daily dosing psych meds—that definitely impacts their budget.” She and others note that psilocybin could help ease the enormous financial cost of mental health disorders, which make up about 10 percent of the global burden of disease. (The market for depression medicine alone is expected to be worth $16.8 billion worldwide next year.) The Eckerts are wary, but not completely distrustful, of bigger players like Compass. “We don't want to see it locked up in hospitals, costing impossible amounts of money,” Tom says. “The market has to play out in some way, but we are doing everything we can to make this a community-based framework.” The ordinance proposed by Decriminalize Denver, the pro-psilocybin movement in Colorado, wouldn’t provide a system for public sales or psilocybin therapy, but for anyone 21 and over, personal use and possession of psilocybin would carry the lowest law-enforcement priority. The group’s ballot initiative, which has been endorsed by the local Libertarian and Green parties, would also prevent the city from spending any money to impose criminal penalties. (Despite living in Colorado, Todd, the psilocybin patient, would not be affected because the law would apply only to Denver.) After the local elections division approved their ballot initiative in October, Decriminalize Denver gathered and submitted more than 8,500 signatures, almost double the required number. About 5,500 were accepted, meaning on May 7, 2019, city voters may decide whether to decriminalize personal possession and use of mushrooms. The mile-high town is historically progressive on drug use: It was the first US city to legalize marijuana, in 2005, and in 2018 the city council voted in favor of overdose prevention sites for drug users to use narcotics like heroin under medical supervision. That law is pending state approval. Denver mayor Michael Hancock has walked back his support for supervised drug use and also does not support the psilocybin proposal. Contrary to popular belief, Denver would not be the first North American locale to decriminalize mushrooms. In 2005, a New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled that growing mushrooms for personal use doesn’t technically count as drug manufacture, so even sprouting psilocybin in your dorm room isn’t illegal. Louisiana also exempts the cultivation of psychoactive plants and fungi “strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes.” Nonetheless, Denver’s precedent on other drug issues has made folks like Kevin Matthews, the DD campaign director, optimistic that voters will reward his efforts. “We talk to people all the time who say ‘Mushrooms have saved my life, mushrooms saved my marriage, mushrooms have broken me out of my depression, mushrooms are the only thing that works for my cluster headaches,’” Matthews says in a call. “I had a gentleman who signed the petition the other day who said it's the only thing that works for his wife's polycystic kidney disease. I had never even heard that one before.” Meanwhile, in British Columbia, a team of seven health care professionals are gearing up for a legal fight in the hopes of legalizing psilocybin for terminal patients with end-of-life distress. About eight years ago, Bruce Tobin, a psychotherapist with 35 years of experience practicing in Victoria, British Columbia, was approached by one of his patients who desperately requested psilocybin therapy. She had survived cancer, but couldn’t shake the debilitating psychological suffering she had experienced with her diagnosis. “She had tried everything: medicines, therapists, $1,000-per-day residential treatment programs. Nothing had worked,” Tobin says in an email. But what she was asking was still very illegal. Rather than break the law, Tobin decided to change it. “I discovered,” Tobin explains, “I could apply for a so-called Section 56(1) exemption that would excuse me from the provisions of the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, allowing me to legally use psilocybin in cases where it was ‘necessary for a medical purpose.’” Thus, TheraPsil was born. The organization is petitioning the Canadian health authority to make psilocybin available medicinally, but only for people with dire need, similar to a trial planned in Melbourne, Australia this April. Tobin filed his application with Health Canada in January 2017, and it has been a slow road ever since, he says. Six other psychotherapists and medical professionals have since joined his efforts. “If they decline to approve our application, our path forward is clear,” Tobin says. “Our legal counsel will file for a judicial review of Health Canada’s decision. If that is unsuccessful, we plan to go to the Federal Court of Appeals using the same arguments based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that were successful in compelling the government to change federal law to allow for patients’ access to medical cannabis. We are feeling confident.” “There have been few, if any, real breakthroughs in the last quarter century in the development of psychiatric medicines,” Tobin adds. “Psilocybin promises to be a real game-changer.” Indeed, it may not be long before psilocybin is legally available, one way or another, in various parts of the globe. As Robin Carhart-Harris, a leading psilocybin researcher, recently put it at the most recent World Economic Forum meeting, “The climate’s looking good.” Like an underground hyphal knot, these efforts could form into fat, juicy mushrooms—the fungal fruits from decades of combined political, scientific, and social justice campaigns to bring psilocybin into the light.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jill-abramson-mistakes-merchants-of-truth_us_5c5f314de4b0eec79b23f5c6---split---Jill Abramson, former New York Times executive editor, should be every journalist’s cautionary tale. The longtime journalist has been skewered this week by others in the industry for her latest work, Merchants of Truth: Inside the News Revolution, a book that dives deep into the news industry ― specifically The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed and Vice ― and how journalistic standards are deteriorating. The book is also allegedly filled with flubbed facts and signs of plagiarism. Abramson has denied plagiarizing in her book and later admitted to National Public Radio that there were passages she failed to cite in the footnotes. “Though I did cite these publications and tried to credit everybody perfectly, you know, I fell short,” Abramson told NPR. In a statement to The Washington Post, the author defended her work. “All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine,” she said. “The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren’t.” As a journalism professor with a resume of coveted roles at the Times, the Wall Street Journal and, now, The Guardian, Abramson certainly should have known how to properly cite her sources. But the above charges weren’t her only journalistic sins. Here are the 7 things Abramson did that journalists should really try to avoid. In an interview with New York Magazine’s The Cut, Abramson bragged about never recording her interviews thanks to an “almost photographic memory.” I do not record. I’ve never recorded. I’m a very fast note-taker. When someone kind of says the “it” thing that I have really wanted, I don’t start scribbling right away. I have an almost photographic memory and so I wait a beat or two while they’re onto something else, and then I write down the previous thing they said. The danger here is obvious. Journalists should almost always record their interviews because humans, however strong their “almost photographic memory is,” are susceptible to mistakes. A recording ensures both the reader and the person quoted that the reporter is accurately reporting the quote, word-for-word. Abramson’s note-taking apparently failed her. In both an uncorrected proof and the finalized version of the book, she made a number of errors, including what color an interviewee’s boots were. please, please, please. young reporters, do not do this. do not, not not not not not do this. especially today. this is a terrible idea. https://t.co/2ETX6ojmLo pic.twitter.com/yziSvKU4mo *whispers* Also, how does a photographic memory help you remember something you heard? Especially since folks have come out and said Jill Abramson got facts wrong in her book. This is *terrible* advice & anyone who thinks your memory serves you well as a reporter should write without looking at notes then check your draft to your notes. It’ll kill this nonsense. https://t.co/p0UeKqZKJZ I used to type interviews on the fly, but if you think you can do it in shorthand with 100 percent accuracy, you're insaaaaaane. At best, you lose the cadence of the person's speech. At worst ... https://t.co/jkhAlUtFL7 Vice News reporter Michael Moynihan was one of the first people to call out Abramson, comparing passages from her book to nearly identical ones from the New Yorker, Time Out magazine and the Ryerson Review of Journalism. Journalist Ian Frisch, who also just published a book, found seven more instances where Abramson borrowed from his original. In examples provided by Moynihan, Abramson tweaked a word or a phrase from another writer’s work, without citing the original source. In most of Frisch’s examples, Abramson used quotes gathered from Frisch as far back as 2014, but did not indicate that she wasn’t interviewing the subjects herself. The following examples from the final book—not the galley—are only from the Vice chapters (I didn’t check the others). So let’s begin...Here is Abramson on Gavin McInnes (whom she interviewed) and the Ryerson Review of Journalism https://t.co/hx0XcyZ89k pic.twitter.com/qroN59gyVk pic.twitter.com/EYl8sHvUQ3 While Abramson denied plagiarizing anyone else’s work, she said during an interview with Vox that she failed to properly cite passages, like the ones Frisch and Moynihan outed, in the footnotes of her book. She also admitted to borrowing facts from other reporters’ work. During that interview, Vox’s Sean Illing pointed out that there were passages in her book that were borrowed from an essay by Jake Malooley in Time Out magazine that was not cited in the footnotes. When asked by Illing if that could be considered plagiarism, Abramson said: “No, I wouldn’t. This was completely unintentional.” “What we’re talking about here are sets of facts that I borrowed,” she added. “Obviously, the language is too close in some cases, but I’m not lifting original ideas. Again, I wish I had got the citation right, but it’s not an intentional theft or taking someone’s original ideas — it’s just the facts.” Illing replied with a question: “Plagiarism is as much about riding the coattails of another person’s labor as it is about stealing their exact words — would you at least agree with that?” In a preliminary version of Merchants of Truth, Abramson incorrectly identified Vice News correspondent Arielle Duhaime-Ross as a “transgender woman.” Duhamie-Ross took to Twitter in January to correct the error, as well as several others that she spotted in the paragraph where she’s introduced. She said that Abramson only took handwritten notes, talked to her for “less than 40 minutes” and never reached out to her after the interview. “I’m not trans,” Duhaime-Ross tweeted Jan. 14. “During our chat, I told her I’m a queer, gender non-conforming woman. She didn’t ask for an explanation. She didn’t ask for my pronouns.” In the final copy, Abramson described the Vice correspondent as a “gender non-conforming woman.” So... the errors. 1. @JillAbramson says I'm a trans woman. I'm not trans. During our chat, I told her I'm a queer, gender non-conforming woman. She didn't ask for an explanation. She didn't ask for my pronouns. (But they're Google search away. https://t.co/7cehaW54S4) 6/21 Duhaime-Ross’s identity wasn’t the only thing that Abramson got wrong. There were a few other incorrect details the Vice correspondent pointed out, but she said Abramson never reached back out to her to verify them. For example, the first version of Abramson’s book said that Duhaime-Ross was wearing “blue desert boots,” though she said in a tweet she only has “brown desert boots. 5. @JillAbramson says I wore "blue desert boots." This is a silly thing, but it speaks to the lack of attention to detail. So here’s the deal: I've never owned a pair of blue desert boots. I do, however, own a pair of brown desert boots. 10/21 Duhaime-Ross also pointed out that Abramson wrote that she “almost missed” covering President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement because she was on her honeymoon and had to rush home. In a tweet, Duhaime-Ross said she returned from her honeymoon on May 30, 2017. Trump made the announcement on June 1, 2017, when she said she was already back in office. Both references to the desert boots and honeymoon were later removed from the Kindle edition of Abramson’s book. 2. @JillAbramson says I "almost missed" the story on the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord bc of my honeymoon I returned from my honeymoon on May 30. The administration's announcement was on June 1st, 2 days later. I was back at work that day. 7/21 3. @JillAbramson says I "rushed" back to cover the Administration’s Paris Accord announcement Again, I was already back in the office. VICE News Tonight is a pre-taped nightly show. When we cover breaking news, we work hard and quickly to get stuff to air. That's normal. 8/21 Journalist Danny Gold also pointed out an instance where Abramson incorrectly stated that a Vice journalist went into an Ebola clinic in Africa without wearing protective clothing. “Wow, this is a straight up lie in Jill Abramson’s book,” Gold tweeted with a photo of a page from the book in January. (Merchants of Truth was released to the public in February, but a galley copy was distributed earlier.) “I was this reporter,” Gold added. “Like every other reporter there, i was told by experts not to walk around with a PPE unless you were in the ICU. I worked alongside Times reporters who a. Gave me that advice and b. Did the same.” Gold said in a series of tweets that the Vice team decided against going into the Ebola treatment center because “it’s a huge risk.” He also shared a link to the documentary which confirms that. Gold added that he spoke with Abramson about not going into the clinic and “sent her links to the video where not 1 but 3 times we elected not to take chances.” Wow, this is a straight up lie in @JillAbramson’s book. I was this reporter. Like every other reporter there,i was told by experts not to walk around with a PPE unless you were in the ICU. I also worked alongside Times reporters, who a. Gave me that advice and b. Did the same. pic.twitter.com/F5hgL1nsxM It’s funny, i actually spoke to Jill about this. She clearly based the entire thing off of a gawker post @hamiltonnolan, a friend, did that promoted the piece. I explained this to @JillAbramson and sent her links to the video where not 1 but 3 times we elected not to take chances We did all this on camera. It’s in the piece. Jill either didn’t watch the piece or didn’t speak in depth to anyone who covered Ebola. I’m probably Streisanding this but i absolutely hate lazy journalism and i take my safety and that of my team very seriously. here's actual visual evidence of me saying we'll wear a PPE suit if we go into the treatment center, then being warned by the doctor that even with that it's a huge risk. So we decide not to go. On camera. https://t.co/zmiYILNbbh When describing BuzzFeed’s former D.C. bureau chief John Stanton, Abramson leaned heavily on a stereotypical version of an ex-convict. In a scene at a BuzzFeed party in which Stanton was tackled by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s security, Abramson describes Stanton as “well-built” and noted his “sleeve tattoos, shaved head, and goatee. Those characteristics, she writes, “distinguished him as the member of the Beltway press corps who looked most like an ex-convict.” Stanton was none too pleased with her choice of word, calling “ex-convict” “tired, fucked up stereotype … used to exclude millions of people, limit their access to employment, strip them of their rights, and lock them into cycles of poverty and crime.” “This may not seem bad to anyone who hasn’t been imprisoned, or who hasn’t had a friend of loved one struggle to re-enter society after being locked up. But the millions of formally incarcerated people in this country, it’s a label that hangs heavy around their necks,” he wrote in a Twitter thread. However, deploying ex-con as short hand for being bad and unfit for polite society is a tired, fucked up stereotype. It’s used to exclude millions of people, limit their access to employment, strip them of their rights, and lock them into cycles of poverty and crime. This may not seem that bad to anyone who hasn’t been imprisoned, or who hasn’t had a friend of loved one struggle to re-enter society after being locked up. But the millions of formally incarcerated people in this country, it’s a label that hangs heavy around their necks. And given the myriad hilarious, biting ways any half decent professional writer could find to shit in my hat, it underscores how out of touch and classist Abramson and a lot of the media elite are.
---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-sen-amy-klobuchar-announces-run-president-n969796---split---Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced at a rally in her home state on Sunday that she is running for president. "Let us cross the river of our divides and walk across our sturdy bridge to higher ground," Klobuchar said at an outdoor event in Minneapolis where a large crowd stood in snowy, freezing conditions. A sense of community "is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics," she added. "We are all tired of the shutdowns and the putdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding." The Minnesota Democrat added it was time "heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good." She also said she will "focus on getting things done" as president. "Let me be blunt: For too long leaders in Washington have sat on the sidelines while others try to figure out what to do about the changing economy and its impact on our lives, what to do about the disruptive nature of new technologies, income inequality, the political and geographic divides, the changing climate, the tumult in our world," she said. "For a moment, let’s stop seeing those obstacles as obstacles on our path. Did we view the snow as an obstacle? No we did not. Let’s see those obstacles as our path." Klobuchar, 58, is the latest senator to join what is becoming a crowded 2020 Democratic primary field of candidates looking to unseat President Donald Trump. A former prosecutor, Klobuchar is looking to run on her legislative record in Congress, where she is known as a moderate who is willing to work with Republicans to achieve policy goals. Klobuchar, who just won reelection to her third term in the Senate, has pursued legislative proposals that aim to promote social media advertising transparency and lower prescription drug prices and played a prominent role in the recently passed farm bill. She also supports a Democratic Green New Deal proposal to combat climate change. In her remarks on Sunday, Klobuchar called for passing a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and passing legislation to automatically register people to vote when they turn 18. The senator also has a record of electoral dominance in a state that is increasingly tilting closer to the middle. Klobuchar won re-election last year with over 60 percent of the vote in a state that has voted Democratic at the presidential level in every election since 1976 but only narrowly went for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. Klobuchar has won each of her three Senate elections by more than 20 points. Although she is somewhat of an unknown nationally, recent polling in Iowa, the first caucus state, has found that far more likely caucus-goers view her favorably than not. Klobuchar raised her national profile during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings last fall for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, who faced the allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, when they were in high school, if he ever blacked out from drinking too much. Kavanaugh, who vehemently denied the allegation, responded: "Have you?" He later apologized to the senator, who has said her father was an alcoholic. As news of her impending announcement broke last week, Klobuchar faced criticism for reports of mistreating her staff. Citing anonymous sources, HuffPost reported that the alleged mistreatment scared off candidates to manage her presidential bid. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, reported that Klobuchar "ran a workplace controlled by fear, anger, and shame, according to interviews with eight former staffers, one that many employees found intolerably cruel." "She demeaned and berated her staff almost daily, subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation within the office, according to interviews and dozens of emails" BuzzFeed reviewed, the publication wrote. Asked by NBC News after the event whether she is too tough on her staff, Klobuchar said she has high expectations for herself as well as her employees and thinks the country needs someone who can get things done. “I love our staff — look at this incredible event they put together," Klobuchar said. "And, yes, I can be tough, and, yes, I can push people, I know that. But in the end, there are so many great stories of our staff that have been with me for years and have gone on to do incredible things. And I have, I’d say, high expectations for myself. I have high expectations for the people that work for me, but I have high expectations for this country. And that’s what we need. We need someone who is focused on getting things done for the country.” Current and former staffers have also come forward to defend the senator. “Senator Klobuchar loves her staff ― they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today,” a campaign spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. “She has many staff who have been with her for years ― including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively ― and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota. She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota.” Asal Sayas, whom Klobuchar’s office referred to BuzzFeed and who was her director of scheduling for three years, told the publication, “Amy was one of the best bosses I’ve had. I found her to be incredibly fair and extremely effective.” Trump was apparently watching Klobuchar's announcement, tweeting about the backdrop of freezing weather "Well, it happened again," Trump wrote. "Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!" Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/whitaker-tells-house-hasnt-messed-mueller-probe---split---Acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker arrives for a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Rayburn Building titled "Oversight of the U.S. Department of Justice," where he is expected to be questioned about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on Friday, Feb. 8, 2019. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told the House Judiciary Committee on Friday that he has not interfered with the special counsel’s Russia investigation and hasn’t promised the White House anything about the probe or informed anyone there about it. Not that it was easy for Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., to get him to say that. Whitaker, who was picked by President Donald Trump to run the Justice Department temporarily when former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to resign in November, appeared keenly aware at the witness table that the juggernaut of interest that follows the special counsel drama was bearing down on his every word. Nadler, the panel’s first questioner, asked Whitaker questions about the integrity of the Robert S. Mueller III-led investigation. He focused on Democratic suspicions that Trump picked Whitaker over more qualified people to run the Justice Department as a way to curtail the probe or deliver information about it to the White House. Watch: A brief overview of Chairman Nadler's opening questions to Matthew Whitaker Whitaker, sometimes consulting paperwork that appeared to have responses pre-written on it, often replied with a long preamble or pushed back against even simple queries such as whether he had been briefed on the Mueller probe. “I cannot talk about ongoing investigations,” Whitaker replied early in the questioning. “You can say whether you’ve been briefed or not,” Nadler pressed. “I have been briefed on it,” Whitaker eventually said. Nadler asked if Whitaker had been briefed on certain days in December; Whitaker demanded to know the basis of the question. Nadler said it was a yes or no question. “Congressman, if every member here today asked questions based on their mere speculation, and I don’t have a factual basis for questions it’s very difficult for me to answer,” Whitaker said. Nadler, near the end of his five-minute round of questioning, said Whitaker’s responses appeared designed to delay answering the questions and said that Whitaker would be asked to return for a deposition under oath, with the transcript released to the public, to give cleaner answers to the questions. After announcing that, Nadler then asked whether Whitaker had been asked to approve or disapprove a request or action to be taken by the special counsel. “Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up, and so, um, I’m here voluntarily, we have agreed to five minute rounds,” Whitaker responded, prompting groans and laughter in the hearing room. It took a few moments of back and forth after that, but Whitaker eventually said: “I want to be very specific about this Mr. Chairman, because I think it's going to allay a lot of fears that have existed among this committee, among the legislative branch largely, and maybe among some American people." "We have followed the special counsel's regulations to a tee. There has been no event, no decision, that has required me to take any action, and I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel’s investigation," Whitaker said. Whitaker also told the committee that, during his tenure, the department has complied with the special counsel regulations and hasn’t changed how it worked with Mueller’s office. “At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,” Whitaker testified. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., in opening statements, said the hearing had nothing to do with oversight of the Justice Department and was character assassination of Whitaker, who likely will no longer have oversight of the Mueller probe next week if the Senate confirms William Barr, Trump's nominee, to be the next attorney general. "Bring your popcorn," Collins said of the day’s political drama. "I'm thinking maybe we just set up a popcorn machine in the back." Whitaker, under questioning from Collins, said that he would “like to talk about the incredible work we have been doing at the Department of Justice since I was chief of staff and now acting attorney general.” The hearing is expected to continue for many hours on Friday.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/nrcc-to-target-55-house-democrats-in-2020---split---Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., chairs the NRCC. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Republicans will be targeting 55 House Democrats in 2020, the majority of whom are new members, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced Thursday. The lengthy target list, shared first with Roll Call, includes all 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. The list also includes 20 districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 that were previously represented by Republicans. “Freedom or socialism — that’s the choice in 2020,” NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer of Minnesota said in a statement. Emmer said the committee is working to recruit “strong, accomplished Republican candidates who will deliver our message of individual freedom and hold these targeted members accountable for the radical policies being pushed by the socialist Democrats in their party.” The list is largely composed of freshman members who flipped GOP-held seats in 2018. But targets also include nine veteran Democrats mostly in Trump districts, including Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois. The NRCC noted that the target list included a House seat it views as “trending toward President Trump,” a reference to Oregon Rep. Peter A. DeFazio. Clinton won his 4th District by one-tenth of a point in 2016, after former President Barack Obama had carried it by wider margins in 2008 and 2012.

Mnuchin to calm plunging financial markets backfired Monday, further rattling investors with new fears about whether major U.S. banks have enough cash on top of worries about interest rates, political instability in Washington and a slowing global economy. He’s a failed U.S. Senate candidate with an undistinguished congressional record who, for the moment, is a blazing-hot 2020 presidential prospect — despite the fact that he may not run and faces long odds if he does. Months after President Trump took office, Russia’s disinformation teams trained their sites on a new target: special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Having worked to help get Trump into the White House, they now worked to neutralize the biggest threat to his staying there. The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former FBI director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies. One post on Instagram — which emerged as an especially potent weapon in the Russian social media arsenal — claimed that Mueller had worked in the past with “radical Islamic groups.” Such tactics exemplified how Russian teams ranged nimbly across social media platforms in a shrewd online influence operation aimed squarely at American voters. The effort started earlier than commonly understood and lasted longer while relying on the strengths of different sites to manipulate distinct slices of the electorate, according to a pair of comprehensive new reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released Monday.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-2020-president_us_5c5079cce4b0f43e410b42fa---split---MINNEAPOLIS — Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) announced Sunday that she will seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, entering an already crowded field of candidates looking to challenge President Donald Trump. “I stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota, to announce my candidacy for president of the United States,” Klobuchar said during a snowy rally in Minneapolis. Klobuchar is one of several Democratic senators running, and among several women in the field, already considered the most diverse pool in history. She said she will campaign at a time when the country is worn down by the “petty and vicious” nature of U.S. politics. “We are all tired of the shutdowns and the putdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding,” she added. “Our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. Not by wallowing over what’s wrong, but by marching inexorably toward what’s right.” Let’s join together, as one nation, indivisible, under God, and pursue the good. pic.twitter.com/ztixvCwCh9 First elected in 2006 after serving as a county prosecutor, the three-term Minnesota senator has been a formidable Trump critic, particularly in questioning the president’s appointees during Senate confirmation hearings, such as then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. As the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, she helped spearhead Capitol Hill lawmakers’ overhaul of their arcane system of addressing sexual misconduct claims, catalyzed by the Me Too movement. Among several lawmakers who resigned or retired after sexual misconduct allegations was Klobuchar’s colleague, then-Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D). In addition to serving as a foil to Trump, Klobuchar hopes to capitalize on her Midwestern roots as an asset, given how Trump’s 2016 victory hinged on narrow victories in nearby states like Michigan and Wisconsin. “She’s the woman for the job,” said Minneapolis resident Brenda Kivi, who attended Sunday’s rally with her husband, Bruce. “She’s got a lot of heart and compassion for others. There’s too much divisiveness right now; we need someone to bring people together.” Despite her personable public image, Klobuchar has a reputation for mistreating her staff, leading to high staff turnover rates in her Capitol Hill office, and difficulties securing people to helm her potential 2020 campaign, as HuffPost reported earlier this month. Klobuchar on Sunday acknowledged the reports for the first time publicly, telling reporters that she “can be tough.” “Yes, I can push people,” she said. “I have high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for the people that work for me, but I have high expectations for this country. ... In the end there are so many great stories of our staff that have been with me for years.” In a roughly 25-minute speech Sunday in Minneapolis’ Boom Island Park, Klobuchar outlined some of the progressive issues that will make up the centerpiece of her 2020 campaign, including campaign finance reform, climate change, universal health care and tax reform. “As your president, I will look you in the eye. I will tell you what I think. I will focus on getting things done. That’s what I’ve done my whole life,” she said. “And no matter what, I’ll lead from the heart.” In January, Klobuchar said that she was nearing a decision about a 2020 bid, consulting with family, friends and advisers. “I do think with a field this big, you don’t have the luxury of waiting for six months or something like that,” she told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “There’ll be raising money issues, you have issues of hiring people and starting an organization. So all of those things would dictate that you have to make a decision sooner rather than later.” Watch Klobuchar’s entire 2020 announcement below. Hayley Miller contributed reporting.

Cory Booker’s favorite presidential campaign-trail yarn ― and he has a lot of them ― is about how his parents, two of IBM’s first black executives, overcame housing market discrimination to raise him and his brother in a predominantly white neighborhood in one of his state’s suburbs. As an adult, Booker likes to recall, he asked Arthur Lessman, the white lawyer who helped his parents outsmart a racist real estate agent, why the attorney was inspired to do it. It turned out that Lessman had volunteered his services after watching television one day in 1965 when the normal programming was interrupted by breaking footage of Alabama state troopers brutally bludgeoning black civil rights activists marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama. Recounting the tale Friday afternoon to an audience of about 100 Democrats at a community college in Waterloo, Booker marveled at the far-reaching power of individual political sacrifices. It’s a testament, he declared with excitement in his voice, to his deeply held belief that “love is a radical force.” The marchers in Selma “stood up for love of country and unleashed that energy and it instantaneously leapt a thousand miles and changed the heart of one man on a couch in New Jersey, who then would go on and change generations not yet born,” he said. “I am here right now because of that chain reaction.” On the same weekend that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to “fight back” against the “class warfare” waged by super-rich against the rest of the country, Booker laid out a progressive vision of a different sort. Rather than embrace a populist dichotomy that pits the broader American public against a common enemy ― an “us” against a proverbial “them” ― Booker focuses almost entirely on the “us” ― on an affinity for his fellow Americans and their historic capacity for self-improvement. Booker, a 49-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, is fond of calling the United States’ forefathers “imperfect geniuses” for founding the country on Enlightenment ideals of humanism and liberal democracy even as they themselves clung to a narrow definition of who was truly human and who was not. In this narrative, the cure for President Donald Trump’s racial demagoguery, cynicism and general nastiness is not simply to fight back with anger directed at corporate and political elites, but to follow Arthur Lessman’s lead and respond with compassionate patriotism. “If we stand up with that energy, if we stand up with that force, if we stand with that love in America, I tell you this, we will rise,” he concluded his remarks to applause at a packed brewery in Marshalltown on Saturday. Unsurprisingly, Booker’s appeals to America’s better angels recalled for many Iowans who saw him the rhetoric of former President Barack Obama, who, as a White House candidate in 2008, asked his countrymen to continue the founders’ work of forming a “more perfect union.” The question is whether, in an era of an emboldened activist left skeptical of Obama’s optimistic outlook and appetite for bipartisan compromise, Booker is the man rank-and-file Democrats want to nominate for the top job. On Booker’s first campaign swing since announcing his plans to seek the presidency on Feb. 1, voters mostly warmed to his pitch. “I was looking for a positive antidote to the poison that Trump puts out ― and I heard it,” said Tom Swartz, 71, a former state representative who heard Booker speak in Marshalltown. After the speech, Sue Blaisdell, 69, a homemaker who has read several of Warren’s books, wanted to hear more from Booker about how he planned to help struggling farmers. (Booker had referenced leveraging antitrust policy to help farmers; he supports enacting a moratorium on agribusiness mergers.) But Blaisdell said she appreciated his positive message and its contrast with Trump’s invective. “It probably is the one most important thing a candidate needs to do to get my vote,” Blaisdell said. Booker joins the already crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders ― which includes several of his Senate colleagues. Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have announced their candidacies; Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are still mulling runs. Booker, whose mother’s family hails from the now-deserted Iowa mining town of Buxton, made clear that he plans to fiercely compete in the state where the balloting kicks off in the presidential race. Few White House contenders have won their party’s nomination without placing in the top three in the Iowa caucuses. “My story is your story,” he told Democrats in Marshalltown, recounting his Iowa-based ancestors journey out of poverty and into the working class. Booker tells story of his Iowa roots. His ancestors moved from Alabama to mining town of Buxton; grandmother grew up in Des Moines. pic.twitter.com/lnrwamvd3V Many of the Iowans who came to hear Booker speak knew him already from his dramatic, televised confrontations with Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearings last year. He burnished his credentials among many Democrats when he released a memo Kavanaugh had written on racial profiling after the Republican-controlled committee refused to publicize it and barred Booker from questioning the nominee about it. On a less positive note, he dramatically referred to the flap as providing him a “Spartacus moment,” a reference that left observers quizzical. Regardless, the hearings gave him a level of name recognition that Gillibrand, for instance, perhaps lacked when she made her first visit to Iowa as a presidential contender in January. And with his partisan bona fides already solid, one way Booker sought to distinguish himself this weekend from the pack based on his experience as mayor of Newark, an impoverished city where he held the top job from 2007 to 2013. “I had to run something,” Booker said in Marshalltown. “And it wasn’t just something. It was a very challenged city. I had to manage it through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. I had to stand in the saddle and make difficult, difficult decisions.” The experience, which required Booker to work for several years with then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), imbued him with a pragmatism and appetite for bipartisan cooperation that he believes benefited him in the Senate. Booker recalled at his various Iowa stops how a particular Republican senator spoke out against his proposals to reform the criminal justice system, before revealing to his listeners, with a smile, that it was their very own Sen. Chuck Grassley. At a Des Moines event, some in the audience booed at the mention of Grassley, which Booker admonished them against doing. Grassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, can make or break any proposed legislative changes to the country’s system of law enforcement and incarceration. Rather than respond by attacking Grassley over the issue, Booker said he made his case to him exhaustively behind closed doors. The result of their collaboration was the passage of the bipartisan First Step Act in December, which makes the most significant changes to the criminal justice system since the 1990s. Among other things, the bill expanded in-prison job training and reduced mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. “Some people in this election are going to tell you we are going to fight fire with fire,” Booker said, referring to partisan sniping. “Well, I ran a fire department. That’s not going to be a constructive strategy.” Of course, Booker’s tenure as Newark mayor is also the source of some of his harshest criticism from the left. He courted Wall Street to help redevelop the city and subsequently spoke up against an ad released by Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012 because the spot blasted Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s work in private equity. As of now, he does not use the term “Wall Street” ― a favorite target of attack among his party’s other White House contenders. (He is quick to point out that he has supported aggressive financial regulation and voted against the 2017 rollback of key elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.) In his efforts to improve Newark’s troubled public schools, Booker championed the introduction of charter schools, which progressives lambaste for undermining labor unions and the concept of education as a public good. Booker’s embrace of charter schools has followed him into Congress. He addressed a convention sponsored by a charter school chain in New Orleans in January at a time when public school teachers in Los Angeles were on strike, partly in opposition to pro-charter school policies. In addition, Booker has faced questions about his willingness to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, which has an outsize presence in New Jersey. He drew progressive ire for voting against a resolution in favor of allowing prescription drug re-importation from Canada two years ago. Booker subsequently worked overtime to prove his bona fides on the issue, foreswearing donations from pharmaceutical industry political action committees and top executives in June 2017. He is also a co-sponsor of the most ambitious drug price legislation in Congress, including a bill he introduced with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would deprive drug companies of their patents if they failed to offer prescription drugs at the prices for which they sell them in other developed nations. In Iowa, Booker did not get many tough questions from voters about his ties to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry or even his support for public charter schools. Time and again, Booker nonetheless opted to lean into his perceived weaknesses, particularly on public education. He lamented attacks on public educators and their labor unions, promising higher pay, more staffing and universal preschool, as well as a more equitable tax code to finance those priorities. Rather than mention charter schools explicitly, the former mayor alluded to his openness to the alternative education institutions with a colorful metaphor. “I was like Malcolm X — by any means necessary, [the children of Newark] were going to get an education,” he said at a panel discussion in the African American Museum of Iowa in Cedar Rapids on Friday evening. At the same time, Booker did not run away from the stances that clearly put him in a more moderate category on economic policy than a Sanders or a Warren. He admitted at the Cedar Rapids event that prior to passage of the Republican tax cut bill in late 2017, he believed the top corporate tax rate was too high. But rather than lower it to 21 percent from 35 percent, as the GOP measure did, he would have left it at 25 or 26 percent. And in a conversation that night about climate policy in Iowa City, he described nuclear energy as part of the solution. More on climate change: He supports nuclear energy and thinks any climate bill must be bipartisan (unless there’s a 60-vote Senate due to “blue tsunami”). This is at supporter’s home in Iowa City. pic.twitter.com/GkkUZVa4E2 Booker was keen to emphasize that action on what he sees as the country’s most urgent priorities ― such as universal health coverage and addressing climate change ― would require either compromise with Republicans or a “blue tsunami” big enough to grant Democrats a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. Booker is a co-sponsor of Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation, which would replace private health insurance with a federal single-payer program. But on two occasions in Iowa, he suggested that the bill is an aspiration unlikely to be realized in the near future, given the constraints of GOP numbers in the Senate. Single-payer health care “is a goal we should shoot at,” he told a crowd of 500 people at Kum & Go Theater in Des Moines on Saturday. In the interim, he proposed backing a Medicare buy-in or lowering Medicare’s eligibility age to 55 or 50. What Booker did not volunteer in his discussion is that he not only opposes efforts to abolish the filibuster in the Senate, he has promised to personally defend the practice if it came under assault. Still, many of the Democrats who attended Booker’s events seemed either unaware of Booker’s deviations from progressive orthodoxy or relatively unbothered by it after hearing him speak. Shawn Harmsen, a 46-year-old journalism professor, hosted a campaign gathering for Booker at his home in Iowa City, where he prominently displayed a blue “I [heart] public educators” sign on his front lawn. Harmsen wants to know more about Booker’s support for charter schools, but held out the possibility that such educational alternatives might be acceptable in circumstances “where you have minority communities who are tired of waiting for the public school system.” Roberta Rosheim, a 69-year-old retired school teacher and union activist, and her husband, David, 74, a seller of rare books, went into Booker’s Des Moines town hall skeptical. Roberta had read about his support for charter schools and his past receipt of pharmaceutical industry money. But Roberta said they emerged “impressed.” David added, “I thought he came out very much for public education.” The fate of Booker’s presidential bid may rise or fall on his ability to thread the needle of his message and convert such voters.

The president claimed that he usually isn’t relaxing during “executive time,” which Axios described as a catchall time for watching television, making phone calls to advisers and friends and reading the news. “When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.” “The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess,” he continued. “I had no choice but to work very long hours!” The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President..... ....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes & too many Regulations, Border, Immigration & HealthCare problems, & much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours! The documents obtained by Axios reveal that the president has spent some 300 hours ― 60 percent of his working hours ― in executive time. On some days, Trump spent nearly the entire working day in executive time, Axios reported. Trump commented Sunday that it should have been “very easy” for the media to get hold of his work schedule. Politico reported Friday that his administration has begun searching for the staffer who leaked it to Axios. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told “Fox News Sunday” that he expects to know the identify of person responsible for leaking the schedule as early as the end of this week. “When we find that person or persons, and it’s likely to be a career staffer, you’re going learn a lot about how hard it is to fire federal workers, Mulvaney said. Asked if that meant the White House wouldn’t be able to fire the leaker, Mulvaney responded that it’s “nearly impossible” to fire a federal worker.

BREAKING: Elkan Abramowitz, the attorney representing AMI CEO David Pecker, responds to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s extortion and blackmail allegations exclusively on @ThisWeekABC: "It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail" https://t.co/zciE3kUO5l pic.twitter.com/RqXsKzjULY Last month, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, announced their divorce shortly before the National Enquirer, owned by AMI, published a story revealing that the billionaire was having an affair with Lauren Sanchez, a TV personality. The Enquirer story prompted Bezos to launch an investigation into AMI’s practices, including how it obtained his private text messages with Sanchez and its motive for publishing the story about his affair. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, has suggested AMI may have been politically motivated to out his affair. President Donald Trump, a friend of Pecker’s, regularly lashes out at The Washington Post’s coverage of his presidency. Among other things, the Post has called out Trump for maintaining a relationship with Saudi Arabia despite the CIA’s belief that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi. In a stunning blog post published Thursday on Medium, Bezos alleged AMI Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard told him the company had obtained several revealing photos of Bezos and Sanchez and that it was considering publishing them if he didn’t drop the investigation. “Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is ‘apoplectic’ about our investigation,” Bezos wrote in the blog post. “For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.” AMI issued a statement Friday morning saying it launched an investigation into Bezos’ claims, though the company believes it “acted lawfully.” “At the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,” the statement said. “Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.” In an interview with the Post published Tuesday, Gavin de Becker, Bezos’ investigator, suggested that Sanchez’s Trump-supporting brother, Michael Sanchez, may have leaked text messages between his sister and Bezos to the Enquirer as a “politically motivated” ploy to embarrass Bezos. On Sunday, Pecker’s attorney Abramowitz would not confirm whether Sanchez’s brother was the source of the texts and photos, but claimed neither Trump nor Saudi Arabia was behind it. He referred to the apparent attempt to blackmail Bezos as simply a “negotiation.” “It’s absolutely not a crime to ask somebody to simply tell the truth ― tell the truth that this was not politically motivated and we will print no more stories about it,” Abramowitz told ABC. “It’s part of a negotiation.” Host George Stephanopoulos fired back, “How is that journalism if you believe the photos are newsworthy? How is it journalism to say we’re not going to publish this if you give us something that we want?” Abramowitz responded that “the story was out there.” “There may be a different argument if we were talking about prior to the first publication, where hypothetically someone could say, ‘You give me a million dollars and we don’t publish this,’” he said. “That’s not what this is.” Attorney representing AMI CEO David Pecker on Jeff Bezos's extortion and blackmail allegations: "It's absolutely not a crime to ask somebody to simply tell that truth ... that this was not politically motivated and we will print no more stories about it." https://t.co/dcuXqRscEC pic.twitter.com/xppb5nihCJ
---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/emerging-border-security-deal-will-be-first-big-test-of-democratic-unity---split---Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said he expects to oppose whatever border security funding agreement appropriators reach because he does not support any funding for a border barrier. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) When it comes to legislating, House Democrats are still in the honeymoon stage of their new majority. They haven’t had to take any difficult votes yet. But the rocky period is coming, and it will likely start next week with a vote on a border security funding package. House and Senate appropriators serving on a Homeland Security funding conference committee signaled Thursday that they’re narrowing in on a border security deal that could be finalized and ready for floor votes next week ahead of a Feb. 15 government funding deadline. While there’s no agreement yet, many of the conferees were optimistic — some more than others — that they’d reach one Friday or over the weekend, providing enough time to draft and file legislation that the House and Senate could advance to President Donald Trump’s desk by the end of next week. Details of the emerging deal are scant, but appropriators from both parties acknowledge it would include some funding for a physical border barrier. And that will be a hard sell to many House Democrats. “The Republicans and the White House are saying they need barriers, wall, whatever you want to call it and that is an absolute objective, and we’re saying we want some other things,” House Democratic conferee Lucille Roybal-Allard of California said. “Like anything else, it’s a trade-off.” Most Democrats are vehemently opposed to a border wall, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has said she’s staying out of the conference committee negotiations, has stated that won’t be part of any final deal. But in recent weeks, Democrats have shown a willingness to discuss funding for some physical barriers, namely fencing, in the interest of getting a deal. Also watch: Democrats downplay appearance of disunity on Green New Deal Yet, there are several progressive and Hispanic members who have been clear that they can’t support any funding for a physical barrier. So whatever deal the appropriators reach will surely result in some Democratic defections. “I can say that I want to wait and see, that I will — that’s the prudent thing to do — but I want to be consistent, and I can’t vote for that,” Arizona Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva said of a border security deal with funding for a physical barrier. He’s unlikely to be the only Democrat who will feel that strongly. The former Congrssional Progressive Caucus co-chairman acknowledged as much but didn’t want to guess how many members would vote against whatever the conference committee comes up with, saying, “There’ll be a lot of pressure not to close government.” As great as that pressure will be, there will be Democrats who can’t get to yes. “I think some people have taken positions that they’re not going to be able to extricate themselves from,” Connecticut Rep. John B. Larson said. Asked Thursday if she thinks she would lose a bunch of Democrats on any compromise because of barrier funding, Pelosi said, “I hope not. I certainly hope not.” House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn said he hasn’t conducted an official count of Democrats who won’t vote for any amount of border barrier funding, but he’s not concerned about a deal fracturing the caucus. “I have complete faith and confidence in these conferees, and if they come out there with what I hope will be unanimous support, it would be what they think is in the best interest of the caucus and the country, and I would be supportive of [that],” the South Carolina Democrat said. House Republicans had an unofficial rule during their time in the majority that they wouldn’t bring bills to the floor that didn’t have the support of at least half of their conference. Democrats should have no problem clearing that bar, but a threshold to watch will be 18 — the amount of votes they could lose from their own party and still pass a bill without Republican support. While any bipartisan deal will likely draw support from a majority of both parties, Democrats frequently criticized Republicans for not being able to pass spending bills on their own and likely would prefer not to be in the same position. For many Democrats, problematic provisions in the conference report would extend beyond money for a border barrier to funding that would support the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and detention practices that they’ve labeled as aggressive and “inhumane.” For example, 21 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote a letter to the conference committee this week, saying they oppose any increases in funding for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies that could be used for immigration detention, “Trump’s deportation force” or a border wall. “Right now we trust the appropriators to negotiate in a manner that’s consistent with what the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Democrats support in the House. But we tried to lay out as plain as possible our red lines,” Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro, who led the letter, told Roll Call on Thursday. The Texas Democrat said he’s not yet sure whether he and his like-minded caucus members could support a deal that included some compromise funding for a physical barrier. “It’s hard to say right now without knowing what the final details are of the legislation, but every once in a while, you do have major pieces of legislation around here that do split up the Hispanic Caucus and the Democratic Caucus,” he said. “I can’t say right now whether this will be one of them.” Roybal-Allard, one of three conferees who are members of the Hispanic Caucus, acknowledged that some Democrats may not be willing to accept whatever trade-offs are made to get to a deal. “Possibly,” she said when asked if a sizable number of Democrats may vote against any deal the conference committee reaches. “In some cases, there’s a total lack of understanding of the role of these agencies,” she said. “For example, CBP, they play a critical role … with commerce, interdiction of drugs and trafficking. ICE plays a critical role. It isn’t just rounding up people, there’s our cybersecurity, human trafficking drugs.” Some progressives, like New York freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, campaigned on abolishing ICE and will not back any deal providing funding for the agency, whether an increase or not. Last month, Ocasio-Cortez was the only Democrat to vote against a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government because it included funding for ICE, albeit just a continuation of the previous fiscal year’s funding. “An agency like ICE, which repeatedly and systemically violates human rights, does not deserve a dime,“ Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday at a press conference with outside progressive groups, including Indivisible, United We Dream, CASA and MoveOn.org, to announce a petition to cut funding for “the deportation force.” Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts also participated in the press conference and are signaling they’d oppose a border security funding compromise. “We are here to draw a line in the sand in the name of love and in the name of justice,” Pressley said. “It is clear that we must reduce and not increase funds to DHS.” A Democratic leadership aide dismissed the progressives who don’t want to fund ICE or CBP as a “small group” and suggested Pelosi picked the conference committee negotiators she did for a reason. “Pelosi is no fool,” the aide said. “Look at the liberals she has on the committee to give folks cover.” California Rep. Barbara Lee, a former Progressive Caucus chairwoman, is among the six House Democratic conferees. Roybal-Allard is also a Progressive Caucus member. Leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus appear open to a border security compromise but said it would depend on the details. “Let’s just see what’s exactly in there, but I think there has been unanimity [that] an actual border wall will be a terrible idea and something that’s unlikely to fly by the caucus,” Progressive Caucus Co-chairman Mark Pocan said, noting that there’s more openness to things such as rebuilding of fencing. Trump will try to say there’s money for the wall in any deal, the Wisconsin Democrat said, noting Pelosi warned caucus leaders of that during a meeting Wednesday evening. “There are three flower arrangements on the table. We’re having a conversation, and she goes, ‘The president will call that a wall, if he has to, to claim a victory,’” Pocan recalled. Rep. Ro Khanna, the first vice chair of the Progressive Caucus, said he trusts Pelosi’s judgment and values on the matter. “I trust that she’s going to make sure that there is no wall that becomes a symbol for nativism — and we’ll fight that,“ the California Democrat said. “And so if she comes to the caucus and feels like we’ve gotten a reasonable proposal … then I would take her recommendation very seriously.” While Khanna said “there may be a few” members Pelosi wouldn’t be able to convince to back a deal, he expects her to have significant influence. “My mom said Nancy Pelosi has now become the most powerful woman in the world,” he said. “So I think her stature has grown, and a lot of people will trust her judgment.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, left, and Peter Welch, D-Vt., attend a news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center with House and Senate Democrats on a report which they say shows prescription drug prices have risen under President Trump on May 10, 2018. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The leader of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee on Thursday offered a proposal to require the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for drugs covered by the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, is set to formally introduce the bill later Thursday with more than 100 House co-sponsors. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate backed by Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. House Democrats are expected to debate the legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, although Senate Republicans are unlikely to take up such a plan. The measure includes tactics to urge drugmakers to reach an agreement with Medicare on a price. The Ways and Means Committee is set to hold a hearing on prescription drug prices next week. “If you only have bidding and you don’t have any power to do anything about those who won’t compete, who won’t negotiate fairly, then you don’t get any place. And so we provide a specific way to encourage negotiation to happen in good faith,” Doggett said. Under Doggett’s proposal, HHS would negotiate prices for prescription drugs covered by the private plans in Medicare Advantage and the Part D program using a set of factors, some of which are laid out in the bill. To encourage drugmakers to negotiate, HHS would issue a competitive license allowing generic manufacturers to produce the drug at a lower cost and provide compensation to the original manufacturer if the department and the brand-name pharmaceutical company did not reach an agreement. A generic manufacturer who produced a drug under a competitive license would receive expedited review of the product from the Food and Drug Administration. While a generic company developed a drug and waited to secure approval, the price of the drug from the original manufacturer would be based on the average price of the drug of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with half the gross domestic product of the U.S. That is somewhat similar to a Trump administration proposal to base prices for drugs covered by Part B on some foreign prices. Negotiations would need to wrap up at least 30 days before an insurance plan year begins. The idea resembles the way the Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates lower drug prices. More than 100 members have signed on to the House bill, Doggett said. An array of advocacy groups including Public Citizen, Families USA and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee backed the bill, which mirrors similar bills Doggett has supported in recent years. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who was among the lawmakers at a Thursday press conference to introduce the measure, introduced a separate bill earlier this year to require HHS to negotiate prices with private Part D drug plans. That measure secured the support of one Republican, Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida. “What we’re going to be doing in Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce is starting to get testimony and then building a political consensus for doing something that’s effective,” Welch said. “It might be this idea that I think is terrific that Lloyd is the leader on, or it might be another. Bottom line: we have a common goal.” Another option some Democrats are considering is to use an independent arbiter to negotiate prices, Doggett said. He said he’s talked with House Democratic leaders about a House floor vote. Brown, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, said he hoped a strong House passage vote would pressure President Donald Trump, who voiced support for Medicare to negotiate drug prices as a candidate but has since backed off that idea, to urge Senate Republicans to consider the bill. House Democrats passed a negotiation bill similar to Welch’s in January 2007 by a vote of 255-170. There were 24 Republican “ayes,” including five current members. But that bill didn’t include the strong-arm tactic of compulsory licensing. The proposal is likely to face fierce resistance from the pharmaceutical industry. Patient and industry groups already have pushed back on more modest plans pushed by the Trump administration to increase insurers’ leverage in Part D, such as a plan to roll back requirements that insurers have to cover almost all drugs in six protected categories, which include treatments for cancer and HIV/AIDS. One of the main criticisms of direct government negotiation in Medicare Part D is that the government would decide which treatments not to cover. That’s currently how the private plans that administer Part D operate, by assembling formularies of covered drugs and making competitors compete to be on those lists. But if a patient can’t get one drug he or she truly needs, there are usually other Part D plans that might offer more appropriate coverage. Patients wouldn’t have that luxury if the government applied a formulary to the whole program. “In lots of European countries, where they have lower prices and price negotiation, they do it by withholding coverage if they don’t like the price,” said James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that focuses on intellectual property. “And that’s good for the budget but it’s certainly not good for the patients that need that drug.” Supporters of the Doggett bill say it challenges the monopoly-pricing business model that the drug industry currently uses in a way that won’t harm access, since other drug companies would be able to come in and manufacture the drug for a better price. “The ability to say, ‘If we can’t come to a satisfactory agreement on what the price can be, if we think the price is excessive, that we can end the legal monopoly,’ that’s really an essential thing to ensure that while you bring prices down you don’t hurt access,” Love added. Still, the government might have a harder time being a hard-nosed negotiator, starting with what it might deem to be an acceptable price. “The government is susceptible to lobbying, is susceptible to direct advocacy, and often has a very difficult time making clinical decisions that are necessary in order to save money,” said Dan Mendelson, founder of the consulting firm Avalere Health and a health care official at the Office of Management and Budget during the Clinton administration.

(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Donald Trump Jr. entered Statuary Hall for his father’s State of the Union address on Tuesday headed for a friendly office but ended up in enemy territory. The president’s son intended to pay a visit to the office of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy but was headed to that of Speaker Nancy Pelosi before he reversed course.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liz-cheney-trump-native-american-jokes_us_5c60486ee4b0f9e1b17e3a5d---split---Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, shrugged off President Donald Trump’s tweets that jokingly referred to Native American genocide to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over her ancestry claims. Cheney, appearing Sunday on CNN’s “State Of The Union,” was asked whether she was concerned about the president seemingly making light of two horrifying Native American tragedies ― the Wounded Knee Massacre and the Trail of Tears. “You represent thousands of Native Americans in Wyoming,” host Jake Tapper noted. “Do you have concerns about the president joking about these horrific tragedies?” But Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, failed to acknowledge Trump’s tweets in her response. Instead, she attacked Warren, who on Saturday officially declared her presidential candidacy, over the Native American ancestry claims she made in her past and for which she has since apologized. “I have concerns about somebody like Elizabeth Warren pretending to be a Native American,” Cheney said. “The notion that anybody of any political party would pretend that they were a member of a tribe or would pretend that they were Native American and would do it as she seems to have done it in order to get benefits ― that is, in my view, the disgrace.” .@jaketapper: “What about the language the President uses and the joking references to genocide against Native Americans?”@RepLizCheney: "Elizabeth Warren has made herself a laughingstock.” https://t.co/hgwicQep8h #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/NJKfAhePMm Tapper again pressed Cheney about Trump’s tweets, but she continued to dance around the question. “Look, Elizabeth Warren has made herself a laughingstock,” Cheney responded. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised that that’s been the reaction to her. ... It’s clear that she’s somebody that can’t be trusted.” Tapper concluded, “OK, so no comment on what the president had to say.” Trump made fun of a video Warren posted to her Instagram account last month that served as a preface to the announcement of her presidential bid. “If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!” the president tweeted at the time. “Wounded Knee” refers to the massacre of hundreds of members of the Lakota tribe, including children, by the U.S. 7th Cavalry near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota on Dec. 29, 1890. “Bighorn” refers to a famed battle in 1876 in which Native Americans annihilated Army troops commanded by Gen. George Custer in what was then the Montana Territory. If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash! pic.twitter.com/D5KWr8EPan Trump continued to needle Warren on Saturday after she announced her presidential bid. “Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore?” the president tweeted. “See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” he added, which many saw as an apparent reference to the Trail of Tears, a series of forced relocations of Native Americans in the U.S. during the mid-18th century. They were forced to march hundreds of miles across the Midwest. Thousands died along the way. Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz! Early in her political career, Warren referred to a distant Native American relative in speeches. Before that, she identified herself as Native American during her tenure as a law school professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. Last week, The Washington Post reported that she identified her race as “American Indian” on her registration for the state bar in Texas. Last October, as she prepared for her presidential bid and in response to the controversies that have surrounded her ancestry claims, Warren released the results of a DNA test that showed the “vast majority” of her ancestry is European but that she had a distant relative who is Native American. Her decision to do so fueled greater scrutiny, with the Cherokee Nation calling the test “inappropriate and wrong.” Warren personally apologized earlier this month to the Cherokee Nation for the DNA test debacle and having identified herself as Native American. She has maintained that her ancestry claims did not help advance her career in any way. “I can’t go back,” Warren said in a recent interview with the Post. “But I am sorry for furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and harm that resulted.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/border-homeland-security-deal-may-come-weekend---split---Cuellar wants five border areas off-limits to barrier construction. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) House and Senate negotiators were planning to work through the weekend to reach a border security deal that would clear the way for a final fiscal 2019 spending package. A House-Senate conference committee on a Homeland Security bill had been hoping to reach an agreement by Friday. But members said they would probably use the weekend to resolve all remaining concerns, with the goal of producing legislative text on Monday. “We need the time to make sure that what we’re agreeing to is what we really need,” said Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. While conferees want a bill drafted by Monday, she said, “We still have some work to do.” Rep. Steven M. Palazzo, R-Miss., a conference committee member, said he expects a deal will be reached “before the end of the weekend” and that aid for disaster victims would be included. “We’re going to have a disaster supplemental for the affected areas,” he said. “That’s for sure.” Watch:As lawmakers begin to hash out border security, how do conference committees work?  The House earlier this year passed a $14.2 billion aid package for victims of hurricanes, wildfires, typhoons and other recent natural disasters; Senate Republicans unveiled their own $12.8 billion version following House passage, but it hasn't advanced to a Senate floor vote. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said Democrats were waiting to hear Republicans respond to their latest proposal. “We’re working as best we can to find that middle ground,” she said. By all accounts, lawmakers are close to completing a deal that would give President Donald Trump something less than the $5.7 billion he has been seeking this year for a southern border wall. But the White House could win something larger than the $1.6 billion for border barriers Democrats had previously offered as part of a bipartisan Senate bill last year. "I've seen the Democratic and the latest Republican offer ... I can tell you this for sure, it's not 5.7 billion dollars for a wall; it's not anywhere close," said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, a member of the House-Senate conference committee. House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., said he's hoping negotiators settle on a number for physical barriers that is "north" of $2 billion. Fleischmann said it's possible Republicans accept less money for migrant detention beds in exchange for more for physical barriers. "The talk has been very heavy about the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] beds," he told reporters. "I'm guessing that would be where the Democrats would be coming from, when the Republicans would be saying, 'Look, give us more money for the wall and higher ICE beds.'" Trump wants enough bed space to house an average daily population of 52,000 migrant detainees; House Democrats want to cut that to 35,520 for the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, phasing out family detention completely by then. A bipartisan Senate version of the Homeland Security bill, approved last June on a 26-5 vote, would have provided funding for 40,520 detention beds. Cuellar said he's also focused on keeping five border areas off-limits to barrier construction: 1 mile in and around the area SpaceX is building a commercial launch facility, near Brownsville, Texas; 2.8 miles within and north of the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge; 0.57 miles of the La Lomita Historic Park; 0.65 miles within and north of the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; and 0.64 miles in and around the National Butterfly Center. "All I'm saying is, can y'all respect the local communities," Cuellar said. Fleischmann said members of the conference committee have been told to stay in town over the weekend to be able to sign a conference report "because of the closeness of the deal." Details on the precise dollar amount and the type of construction to be allowed on the barrier were still being negotiated. “It’s not just numbers,” Granger said. “It’s not just a fence. It is a fence and all that comes with it.” One GOP conferee, Tom Graves of Georgia, was a little more circumspect than others about how close the negotiators are. "I'm not optimistic, but I'm hopeful," he said. "We've been working in good faith, I hope the other side does as well. And that they don't try to overreach at the 11th hour, which they may have a tendency to do." Democratic leaders have expressed similar concerns about the willingness of Trump to sign what the conferees can produce, and what passes both chambers. They point to previous Trump reversals, such as his refusal to sign a six-week stopgap in December, which led to the 35-day partial government shutdown. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said if there's a deal and Speaker Nancy Pelosi brings it to the floor, he expects there'll be enough bipartisan votes for it to pass. He also dismissed concerns that Trump would not sign a bipartisan deal. "I do believe at the end of the day we'll all be in the same place," McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters. But, he added, “It would be in my opinion right that we know where the president stands before we vote on this." Cuellar, Fleischmann and Graves are among those headed to Camp David Friday to meet with White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to discuss the legislative agenda. "They didn't say what we're going to talk about, but I'm sure this topic is going to come up ," Cuellar said, adding that Mulvaney is a "good man" who he can get along with. Congress must pass a final spending package by Feb. 15 to avoid another partial government shutdown when a stopgap funding measure runs dry. A deal would encompass the seven unfinished appropriations bills for fiscal 2019 that amount to about $320 billion in discretionary spending: Homeland Security, Agriculture, Financial Services, Transportation-HUD, State-Foreign Operations, Commerce-Justice-Science, and Interior-Environment.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/trump-audience-house-chamber-not-one-that-matters---split---House Democrats pose for photos before the State of the Union. They’re not the audience that counts, Winston writes. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) OPINION — Let’s start with the fact that I’m writing this before, not after, the State of the Union. (Deadlines are sometimes inconvenient.) So, with that caveat in place, I’m going to suggest that whatever Donald Trump said in his speech, whatever antics the Democrats planned to distract and disrupt the proceedings, what matters most isn’t the reaction in the House chamber or the post-speech punditry. What matters is whether the president’s words and his vision for the future connect with a decidedly divided American public. It’s an understatement to say that there isn’t much that partisan America seems to agree on these days. Still, most voters — Republicans, Democrats and independents — would probably agree that State of the Unions are usually long, dull laundry lists of accomplishments and proposals, preceded in the days leading up to them by great expectations, at least inside the Beltway. Ask anyone on the street six months after Barack Obama’s last SOTU or Donald Trump’s first to tell you what either said, and you’ll probably get more blank stares than recollections, good or bad. Historically, State of the Union speeches rarely deliver memorable presidential rhetoric, in part because they try to please so many audiences, each one judging the speech’s merits through a very different lens. Congress — Republicans and Democrats — will define the success or failure of the speech based on their partisan and ideological beliefs, and in the case of Trump, their personal feelings toward this controversial leader. If a president proposes lots of new spending to fund a rash of new programs, Democrats and the media, another audience, will praise its substance and vision. If the speech takes a turn to the right by looking to limit government and federal spending, Republicans will see the speech as a great success, while their opposition and the mainstream media will see it as devoid of ideas. In other words, a dud. Bureaucrats and policy wonks — in and out of government — are probably more interested in the speech’s footnotes, checking to see where a president puts his issue focus and whether their “policy ox” is being gored or funded. Finally, there are the special interest groups, from the Sierra Club and the AFL to the Chamber of Commerce and the NRA. They generally assess the speech from a very narrow perspective. No climate change talk, and the greens see red. No mention of the Second Amendment, and the gun lobby sends out the alarm. Because every State of the Union has so many audiences it must placate, the speech is usually weighed down by the very heft of issues needed to keep the peace in Washington, assuming that’s still possible. But despite the clout of the D.C. political class, the truth is the audience outside Washington — the millions of Americans watching the State of the Union — will determine whether Trump’s words resonate with an electorate growing increasingly impatient with the inability of the two parties to work together to solve their problems. Much of Washington is wedded to a partisan viewpoint regardless of the issue, mired in the politics of resistance to an election outcome they simply can’t accept. But what hyper-partisans don’t seem to understand (and there are some on both sides) is that most people don’t see issues through their political prism. This base-driven division has brought the nation to a kind of Alice in Wonderland moment where up is down and down is up, depending on whether you have an R or D behind your name. Last Friday’s monthly jobs report showed the economy delivered an amazing 304,000 jobs and significant wage increases in January, beating expectations by a huge margin. On Monday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stood on the Senate floor and, in a “prebuttal” to the State of the Union, actually said, “The president will say predictably that the state of our Union is strong, but the truth is the state of the Trump economy is failing America’s middle class.” By what measure? Nancy Pelosi continues to claim that a border wall is “immoral” when the country has built nearly 700 miles of walls or fencing since 2006, border security that her party supported. Republicans aren’t totally immune from partisan overhype either, but the personal back-and-forth, the name calling and a purely partisan unwillingness to compromise has created an unusual environment for this State of the Union — a country without consensus. In a recent focus group, we heard one voter bemoan the partisanship that makes this year’s State of the Union more likely a battleground than a genuine coming together to find a positive way forward for the country. He told us, “I think we’ve become a people of labels. …It begins a divide. Once you divide you’ve got to pick a side. ... When you take a side, you got to defend. Once I defend, I’m going to defend to the end.” In the most recent Winning the Issues survey, that divide was very apparent. Republicans were positive about the direction of the country 65-25 percent (right direction-wrong track). Democrats were negative, 16-77, while independents were negative at 30-54. When asked about the direction of the economy, Republicans think things are doing well by a 75-12 margin; Democrats, despite the economic numbers, think the economy is going badly 17-65, and independents split 41-41. Most people who watch the State of the Union aren’t living in the political past, trying to undo the last presidential election. Nor are they fire-breathing members of a party base demanding “Medicare for All,” or a border wall or nothing. These ordinary Americans are listening for a speech that defines the future, not relitigates the past. They are listening for a speech that unites, not divides, and offers real solutions to the everyday struggles they face. That’s a tall order for the White House speech writers this year with a country so divided, each side clinging to their own set of facts while folks begin to wonder whether we have a union at all. By the time you finish reading this, the 2019 State of the Union may be a page in history. Let’s hope unity, not division, prevailed.

The Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate suggested at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday that Trump, who is facing an ongoing federal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, may be behind bars by the next presidential election. “By the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president,” she said to applause. “In fact, he may not even be a free person.” Warren went on to depict Trump as being “the symptom of a badly broken system,” which she said requires not a reaction, but action. “So our job, as we start rolling into the next election, is not just to respond on a daily basis, it’s to talk about what we understand that is broken in this country, talk about what needs to be done to change it, and talk about how we’re going to do it,” she said. “Because that is not only how we win, it’s how we make the change we need to make.” Warren’s direct hit at Trump comes one day after Trump recycled his use of “Pocohontas” as a racial slur against Warren after she announced her candidacy for president. “Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,” he tweeted, ignoring tribal leaders’ past calls to stop using the name of a historical Native American figure to criticize a political opponent. “Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” His capitalization of the word “trail” also sparked backlash over the apparent reference to the “Trail of Tears,” which was the extremely brutal and forced relocation of Native Americans by the government. Warren has taken heat for claims to Native American ancestry. She apologized to the Cherokee Nation earlier this month for releasing a DNA test in an attempt to prove it.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mick-mulvaney-shutdown_us_5c6030e6e4b0f9e1b17e27a1---split---Another partial government shutdown later this week “absolutely cannot” be ruled out, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday. Mulvaney, who also serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that congressional talks to keep the government open are “all over the map, and I think it’s all over the map because of the Democrats.” Beginning in late December, several key government agencies closed for a record 35 days because of the ongoing dispute over President Donald Trump’s insistence that Congress approve more than $5 billion to pay for a wall on the U.S. southern border. The affected government offices reopened in late January with temporary funding through Feb. 15. Democratic and Republican lawmakers seeking a long-term funding agreement last week expressed optimism about reaching a deal, but that confidence appears to have dissipated. “I think the talks are stalled right now. I’m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning because time’s ticking away,“ Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said on “Fox News Sunday.” Along with the continuing disagreement about how much money to devote to border security and such measures should include an actual wall rather than different types of barriers, there’s a dispute over the number of beds the government should fund to detain unauthorized migrants. The Trump administration has called on Congress to appropriate funds for 52,000 additional detention beds as part of its new migrant detention policy. Migrant detention camps have swelled in some towns on the border with Mexico and many of the facilities are full of children detained as part of Trump’s controversial family separation policy last year. While lawmakers technically have until Friday to avert a shutdown, they face a more immediate deadline because of Senate procedures that stymie quick passage of legislation. In order to get a bill out of Congress and onto Trump’s desk by Feb. 15, work on a funding bill needs to start within the next 24 hours. As a result, there could be a push for another short-term funding bill while efforts continue to reach a final deal. “I’m not confident we’re going to get there,” Shelby said, estimating the current odds of a deal at “50-50.“ Even then, it remains unclear whether Trump will accept whatever solution comes out of Congress. He has been threatening for months to declare a “national emergency” and divert money from other programs to build hundreds of miles of wall along the Mexican border if Congress does not appropriate $5.7 billion for the project. The White House has not taken the threat off the table despite substantial opposition to the national emergency idea from many Republicans in Congress. A persistent GOP criticism of former President Barack Obama was that he exceeded his authority by ignoring Congress and enacting policies through executive orders. Mulvaney on Sunday broached the prospect of Trump moving ahead with wall construction without resorting to the national emergency route. “There are pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency” declaration, he said.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/3-reasons-democrats-are-climbing-all-over-themselves-tax-rich-n969586---split---WASHINGTON — Setting up a general election contrast with President Donald Trump, Democrats are one-upping one another with proposals to impose new and higher taxes on millionaires, billionaires, their investments and their heirs. The push to tax the rich any way they can is fast becoming a defining feature of the progressive landscape as the 2020 campaign gets under way. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wants "ultra-millionaires" to pay a 2 percent annual tax on assets over $50 million. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is weighing another presidential run, is calling for new estate tax rates as high as 77 percent on billion-dollar-plus inheritances. Both proposals came not long after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called for a 70 percent tax rate on income over $10 million. Other plans were already floating around the Democratic primary field before last month and it's likely more will follow. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., wants higher estate taxes to finance a "baby bond" for every child. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Sanders have teamed up on a bill to tax financial transactions, a concept Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also says she supports. "Taxing the rich has probably been the most popular Democratic policy as long as I've been looking at Democratic polling," Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, told NBC news. While Democrats have long called for higher taxes on the well-off, activists and party leaders say a variety of overlapping political and economic trends have lent the issue more urgency and produced more far-reaching proposals. Part of the renewed emphasis on taxes is an attempt to regain the populist high ground from Trump, a billionaire who campaigned on boasts he would raise his own tax bill, only to pass a $1.9 trillion tax cut tilted toward high earners. Within the Democratic Party's left wing, many see Trump's presidency as an opportunity to turn the clock back to a time before President Ronald Reagan's popular small-government pitch put Democratic leaders on the defensive over taxes. As politicians like Warren and Sanders often note, the top income tax rate was at least 70 percent until the 1980s and even hit 94 percent during World War II. "We started bargaining against ourselves, and I think it created a fear of being bold and a fear of being definitive," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has urged Democrats to make taxing the rich a political focus, told NBC News. "Then you fast forward all the way up to 2016, and a whole lot of voters — people who have been (Democratic) voters throughout their lives — couldn't even recognize their party." Democrats see potential upside in their message. Polling by Gallup has consistently shown voters don't think the rich and corporations pay enough in taxes. Early polls this year have found majority support — including from a substantial number of Republicans — for Warren's wealth tax. (The results are more mixed on Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent proposal.) Trump, hoping to win back voters who abandoned the GOP in the midterm election last year, has hammered the tax proposals as part of his broader argument that Democrats have become too radical. "You know, it's interesting. I've been watching our opponents, our future opponents, talk about 70 percent," Trump told reporters last month. "What happens is you really have to study what's happened to Venezuela. It's a very, very sad situation." With Democrats in a credible position to gain a governing majority in 2020 and moving to the left, along with Republicans throwing deficit concerns to the wind under Trump, the new tax proposals are viewed as more than just campaign PR. They could actually become law. "There is a sense that it’s important to have very concrete proposals that could be implemented in 2021 if the Democrats win the White House and Congress," said University of California-Berkeley professor Gabriel Zucman, an economist specializing in inequality whom both Warren and Sanders cited in announcing their tax plans. Democrats are looking for new sources of revenue to finance increasingly ambitious progressive goals, from universal health care to free college to a Green New Deal, and taxes on the wealthy tend to be the most politically palatable option. Michael S. Linden, a fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, estimates that raising the effective tax rates on the top 0.1 percent of earners by 15 percent, the top 1 percent by 10 percent and the top 5 percent by 5 percent, could raise about $5 trillion combined. While taxes on the rich alone couldn't offset single-payer "Medicare for All," which some estimates suggest would add $32 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, they could finance a variety of other high-profile Democratic agenda items. "If you put Medicare for All to one side, you can start talking about all the other proposals: debt-free college; free college for all; a child-care program; massive infrastructure investment; paid family leave," Linden said. Brian Riedl, an economist at the Manhattan Institute who has advised Republicans, argues that while it's "mathematically possible" to raise several trillion dollars from higher income households alone, he’s skeptical that either Warren's wealth tax or a new 70 percent tax rate could hit their revenue goals. That's because they'd likely cause the rich to change their behavior to avoid the tax. "Wealthy people would start putting their money where it can minimize taxes instead of where it can finance investments and economic growth," he said. To some advocates for higher tax rates on the rich, raising revenue isn't the only point, it's also about changing how the 1 percent behave. By imposing steeper top tax rates, they argue, companies will have less incentive to lavish executives with higher and higher salaries, potentially reducing inequality even if the shift means less tax revenue. This gets into one way the tax debate around the 2020 campaign has sharpened compared to prior election cycles. Especially among more left-leaning lawmakers, the argument isn't just that billionaires need to pay more taxes in order to finance Democratic programs. It's that the proliferation of billionaires is a threat in and of itself — and that knocking them down a peg would be a public good. The more that wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, they say, the more that the ultra-rich will muscle aside competition, secure gains through government policy, stymie efforts to undo their influence and then pass the same power to their children. "The consequence of having amassed that much wealth is bad for our economy," Warren said in an interview explaining her wealth tax on MSNBC's "All In" last month. Warren said that having a small group of people making decisions that always tend to favor a lot of big corporations is bad for democracy, because it means "a democracy that is influenced by the wealthy, the well-connected and is not working for the people." Warren has tangled early on with Michael Bloomberg and Howard Schultz, two billionaires weighing self-funded runs for president who have been critical of Democratic proposals to tax the rich. Schultz cited Ocasio-Cortez's call for a 70 percent tax in explaining why, if he runs, it won't be as a Democrat. In this sense, Democratic rhetoric and policies may be coming into alignment with another era in which rapid technological change created a surge in wealth and inequality and prompted an eventual voter backlash to go with it: the Gilded Age of the late 1800s. The populist and progressive movements that emerged in that era came in response to the rise of powerful billionaires like Andrew Carnegie and Cornelius Vanderbilt and invoked fears that too much wealth would lead to an immovable ruling class. One popular 19th century reformer, Henry George, even proposed a land tax in response. "The big question was whether you can have a functioning democracy when you have a small number of people with staggering loads of wealth," Edward T. O'Donnell, a history professor at the College of the Holy Cross, said in an interview. "The fear of a rising aristocracy within a democracy was quite real." The Gilded Age eventually resulted in a burst of progressive legislation in the 20th century, including new federal income taxes and estate taxes, but it took decades to get there, with many failed political campaigns along the way that did not win popular support. Now, some in the 2020 presidential field are hoping history repeats itself and a little bit faster. Benjy Sarlin is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/democratic-wealth-tax-warren-sanders-ocasio-cortez.html---split---Supported by By Patricia Cohen and Maggie Astor The only thing more startling than the flurry of tax proposals Democrats have unveiled in recent weeks is the full-throttle response they’ve gotten from the public. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested a near doubling of the top income tax rate. Senator Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with the party, introduced a bill to raise taxes on dynastic heirs. And Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a levy that has never existed in the United States: a wealth tax, assessed annually on America’s biggest fortunes. The soak-the-rich plans — ones that were only recently considered ridiculously far-fetched or political poison — have received serious and sober treatment, even by critics, and remarkably broad encouragement from the electorate. Roughly three out of four registered voters surveyed in recent polls supported higher taxes on the wealthy. Even a majority of Republicans back higher rates on those earning more than $10 million, according to a Fox News poll conducted in mid-January. Riding the momentum of a 40-seat pickup in the midterm elections, Democrats are bringing to the fore audacious policy ideas that have been mostly simmering on the sidelines. As the middle class continues to thin out and wealth concentrates among a tiny sliver of Americans, the party’s powerhouses are questioning economic verities that have stood for decades. Not since President Bill Clinton urged Americans to embrace a hands-off, neoliberal approach to markets — declaring in his 1996 State of the Union that “the era of big government is over” — have Democrats experimented with such a shift in fundamental economic assumptions. Taxes, deficits, spending, financial deregulation — everything is up for appraisal. “This is clearly a tectonic shift in what Democrats are willing to propose,” said William Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, referring specifically to the latest tax proposals. “It just feels like a very different environment for policy discussions than, say, two or three months ago.” The new terrain comes with risks, revealing potential philosophical and tactical fault lines among Democrats, who must decide whether to get out in front of the movement or exercise caution. Some hopefuls for the party’s 2020 nomination, certainly, are staking out more moderate positions — a group that includes former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and younger challengers like Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker. And it is an open question whether aggressively redistributive tax plans will continue to resonate with voters, or come to be seen as a move to the hard left that alienates the middle of the country. Perhaps sensing an opening, President Trump used his State of the Union address to observe: “Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.” He added, “Tonight, we resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” What is palatable politically and economically, though, has been refigured by Mr. Trump’s own unorthodox presidency — and by the brushoff Republicans gave the deficit when they passed a $1.5 trillion-tax bill in 2017 that primarily benefited upper-income households and corporations. Those developments are helping shoot-the-moon visions on the left — like “Medicare for all” or a “Green New Deal” to halt climate change with massive public investment — find firmer footing on political ground. The result is that ideas that have long nipped at the edges of the political conversation are now smack in the middle of it, and think tanks, industry groups and candidates are earnestly analyzing their costs and benefits. The latest string of ambitious tax proposals all “pass a plausibility smell test,” said Jared Bernstein, former chief economic adviser to Mr. Biden. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for instance, billionaires and business school professors discussed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s views on tax rates. “There are an increasing number of Democrats who believe they have the clearance to do something big and bold,” Mr. Bernstein said. “I think the critics will be less successful.” Ms. Warren has gone the furthest in marrying big ideas and granular wonkiness, with a plan that calls for an extra 2 percent annual tax not on income but on all assets — like stocks, real estate and art — owned by households above the $50 million level. The rate would rise to 3 percent on fortunes above $1 billion. The Massachusetts senator’s campaign estimates the policy would raise $2.75 trillion over the course of a decade from roughly 75,000 households, out of a total of 127 million, in the United States. Ms. Warren attached addenda from respected economists and legal scholars to head off skeptics, but questions about the plan’s practicality will inevitably persist. Sweden and other European countries have abandoned wealth taxes in recent years because of problems with enforcement. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, hasn’t offered a concrete proposal. But her broad defense of high marginal rates for multimillionaires, floated during a “60 Minutes” profile, kick-started the current debate — and demonstrated her preternatural ability, at age 29, to shift the bounds of policy talk. In 2017, debating the Republican tax bill, Congress argued whether the top income rate should be reduced to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. (It was.) With one interview, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez got the country talking about whether the rate should zoom as high as 70 percent. According to estimates by the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model, lifting the top rate as she has described would raise $353 billion. Other independent estimates figured it would affect roughly 16,000 households. Some type of wealth tax and higher rates at the tippy top have long been at the front of Mr. Sanders’ playbook; the same is true of a bill to impose a transaction tax on stock, bond and other financial trades. The Vermont senator’s new estate tax bill — just the latest iteration of a popular Democratic perennial — is a response to a recent Republican effort to altogether end what critics prefer to call a “death tax.” Individuals can now leave their heirs about $11 million tax-free. According to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the average rate on taxable estates in 2018 will be 16.5 percent. Mr. Sanders would lower the asset threshold to what it was in 2009, so that only the first $3.5 million inherited is tax-free. The next $6.5 million would be taxed at a 45 percent rate. Additional chunks of money would trigger higher rates — up to 77 percent on the value of estates above $1 billion. Wojciech Kopczuk, a Columbia University professor of economics, estimated that the Sanders plan would capture money from 8,000 estates per year that currently owe no estate taxes. Mr. Sanders would also eliminate dynasty trusts, which allow families to shelter colossal holdings from taxes as they pass from one generation to the next. His office estimated that the bill would raise at least $315 billion over 10 years. Aside from his policy particulars, Mr. Sanders has been explicit in his broader aims to restrain a homegrown aristocracy that inherits entrenched power and money. In announcing his tax proposal, he quoted Teddy Roosevelt’s warning about the dangers of a small class of enormously wealthy individuals “whose chief object is to hold and increase their power,” and underscored the moral and political imperative to put some limits on dynastic wealth. “It is a very dangerous and unjust situation where so few have so much and so many have so little,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “When 46 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent, who believes that that is right or that that is good for the economy?” Ms. Warren and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have expressed similar sentiments. Warning of a poisoned democracy, Ms. Warren said government had “become a tool for the wealthy and well-connected.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told an interviewer. “I do think that a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.” If such comments inspire supporters, they also reveal potential divisions among the rising crop of Democrats. The left-leaning Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are all viewed as less business-friendly than Ms. Gillibrand, Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, who have not made taxes on the rich a centerpiece of their public pitches. In that sense the latter trio is following the example set by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and President Barack Obama before her, with comparatively establishment-minded thinking on progressive taxation. Ms. Harris, for example, was asked at a Drake University town hall in Des Moines about the morality of multibillionaires in a society with so many poverty-stricken children; she responded by calling for more taxes on the top 1 percent. Yet the California Democrat’s language, approach and proposals have a distinctly different tone than, say, that of Mr. Sanders, and she has not focused her campaign so far on attacking the wealthy or warning about an oligarchy. Her tax bill offers credits up to $6,000 for families earning less than $100,000 a year, without providing many details of who would make up the difference. Ms. Gillibrand backs a broader estate tax and Mr. Sanders’ financial-transactions tax. Like Ms. Harris, though, her focus has been on bolstering people at the bottom and in the middle, with more generous tax credits for the working poor and middle-class tax cuts. Mr. Booker of New Jersey, the most recent entrant in the Democratic field, supports returning the estate tax to 2009 levels, as Mr. Sanders does, noting that inheritances widen the wealth gap and particularly disadvantage minorities. Mr. Booker has also opposed a loophole that enables heirs to avoid paying taxes on capital gains. But in the early days of his presidential campaign, he has avoided charged language about taxing the superrich and played on more familiar turf such as the carried-interest loophole, which benefits hedge-fund and private-equity executives. That tax break is so widely scorned outside Wall Street that even Donald Trump campaigned against it in 2016. A more traditional blend of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism can also be found among several self-designated centrists and pragmatists, like Mr. Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who officially registered with the party in October. Mr. Biden, who has not formally announced that he will seek the White House in 2020, has called generally for higher taxes on the rich and investment income, along with more generous tax credits for the working middle class. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire dozens of times over, previously supported reducing and simplifying corporate tax rates, though he denounced the Republican tax program that passed in 2017. And he backed increasing the earned-income tax credit to help lower-income working families. But Mr. Bloomberg, who has castigated Ms. Warren’s proposed wealth tax as disastrous and unconstitutional, rejects the premise that wealth has an insidious effect on democracy. And among potential Democratic presidential candidates, he is the only one who has continued to sound the deficit alarm, warning that ambitious proposals for health care or climate control could bankrupt the government. Mr. Bloomberg’s positions highlight tensions likely to arise between an activist wing eager to energize voters and an establishment wary of turning off moderates and independents who dislike President Trump but are alarmed by jeremiads about wealth. Democrats across the board may endorse the idea that the wealthiest sliver of Americans should contribute more to help pay for ambitious health care and education programs. Some may be leery, though, of policies that smack of class warfare. There are practical concerns as well, even if they are taking a back seat for the moment. In interviews, more than a dozen Democratic economists and policy advisers applauded the bold tax proposals while maintaining their preference for more test-driven reforms like closing loopholes, raising top rates and changing the rules around capital gains. Those familiar fixes are less splashy, but they avoid some of the administrative and enforcement hurdles that unconventional proposals, particularly a wealth tax, present. “Gradually and then suddenly” is how a character in Ernest Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises” explains going bankrupt. The same might be said of political tipping points. A midterm election that gave Democrats control of the House and brought in a vocal class of more liberal representatives is one reason the range of proposals has so quickly expanded. But just as important as that electoral victory was a previous one — by Mr. Trump — that showed bravura and brashness could prevail over conventional wisdom and caution. “Trump’s election has scrambled people’s views a little bit of what’s politically possible and what is not,” said Jacob Leibenluft, who led Hillary Clinton’s economic policy team during her presidential campaign and served on the Obama administration’s National Economic Council. “It opened up space for set of policies that simultaneously have a populist feel to them and are grounded in economics.” At the same time, enthusiasm for the suddenly popular propositions has deeper roots. Several ideas about taxes, public spending and deficits rattled around liberal circles for years, or surfaced during Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign, before their recent move to center stage. Over the last couple of decades, economists have produced terabytes of new economic data and research charting the effect of the neoliberal cocktail of deregulation, low taxes and cranked-up competition in a global economy. Among the most influential work: findings by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman detailing the concentration of wealth. Using advanced computing technology and novel data sets, they cataloged the economic fallout that market forces have wrought with unprecedented specificity and range. They also outlined how a wealth tax could work. “We would have had a picture, a sense that something was wrong,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist who has sounded warnings about growing inequality since the early 2000s. “But they nailed down the numbers that showed 40 percent of the world’s wealth is controlled by 1 percent of the people.” Mr. Zucman said he and Mr. Saez first started meeting with Ms. Warren and other potential presidential candidates in 2014. Last month, the two economists — both professors at the University of California, Berkeley — vetted her wealth-tax proposals and calculated the revenue estimates. Beyond taxes, ideas out of academia have also shifted the political conversation around deficits. Notably, there’s modern monetary theory, pushed by a group of economists led by Stony Brook University professor Stephanie Kelton. She argues that societal needs should determine public spending, not deficits. The call to end Washington’s obsession with red ink has attracted some other surprising advocates, who took a decidedly different route to get there. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and the director of President Obama’s National Economic Council, and Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, recently published an article in the journal Foreign Affairs declaring everyone should stop worrying so much about the debt. Government deficits matter, they said, just not as much as other things like investing in education, health care, persistent poverty or climate change. “I don’t think there’s any question that the economic reality has changed in ways that should change policy choices,” Mr. Summers said in an interview. “And one should be more worried about issues of fairness and appropriate regulation, more worried about assuring adequate demand and social protection in the balance than would have been the case 20 or 25 years ago.” Deficit hawks, naturally, are not about to concede without a fight. “The challenges facing the economy feel so big that big solutions seem to be the answer,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “But we just don’t have the fiscal environment to support that. When interest payments are the fastest-growing part of your budget, that is a warning.” The next national elections are still nearly two years away, of course, and the list of potential Democratic presidential hopefuls stretches further than a Cronut line. Policy disagreements will sharpen. What should take priority now, veteran Democratic operatives are emphasizing, is the big picture, rather than brass-tacks policy debates. “Sometimes we argue and negotiate among ourselves to the point where we absolutely smother our aspirations,” said Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Biden’s former adviser. “That’s not just a tactical mistake, but a political one and an economic one. Now the moment belongs to the bold.” Advertisement
---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html---split---Supported by By Mitch Smith and Lisa Lerer MINNEAPOLIS — Amy Klobuchar, the third-term Minnesota senator, entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday, hopeful that her moderate politics, Midwestern roots and carefully cultivated history of bipartisanship can appeal to a broad swath of voters in contentious times. On a snow-covered stage in Minneapolis along the banks of the Mississippi River, with the temperature barely above single digits, Ms. Klobuchar said that as president she would “focus on getting things done” and reverse some of President Trump’s signature policies. On her first day in office, she said, the United States would rejoin the Paris climate agreement. “For too long, leaders in Washington have sat on the sidelines while others try to figure out what to do about our changing economy and its impact on our lives, what to do about the disruptive nature of new technologies, income inequality, the political and geographic divides, the changing climate, the tumult in our world,” she said. “Let’s stop seeing those obstacles as obstacles on our path,” she continued. “Let’s see those obstacles as our path.” Ms. Klobuchar, 58, is the fifth woman currently serving in Congress to announce her candidacy, joining a crowded and diverse field of Democratic presidential hopefuls. With most of the top-tier candidates hailing from coastal states, Ms. Klobuchar believes her low-key brand of “Minnesota nice” politics could make her a compelling candidate, particularly to the Iowa voters who cast the first primary votes and in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that swung the 2016 election to President Trump. “She’s not afraid to just be herself,” said Shirley Friberg, 81, of suburban Minneapolis, who clutched a cup of hot cocoa before the event and offered a scarf to a frozen stranger. “And I think in small towns, that’s a big thing.” [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] A politician who prides herself on being able to “disagree without being disagreeable,” Ms. Klobuchar coasted to victory in November, beating her Republican opponent with 60 percent of the vote in a state that Mr. Trump nearly won in 2016. She won with much larger margins than other high-profile Democrats running statewide. Despite Ms. Klobuchar’s friendly public persona, she’s said to be a difficult boss. A survey of senators by the website LegiStorm from 2001 to 2016 found that her office had the highest turnover in the Senate. “I have high expectations,” she told The New York Times last year. A recent HuffPost article portrayed her as a demanding manager who lost some potential 2020 campaign staff members because of her reputation. Republicans latched onto that criticism on Sunday, dismissing her candidacy as one of limited appeal. “She has virtually no grass-roots backing and even her own staff is complaining that she’s ‘intolerably cruel,’” Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. Her popularity at home, however, was hard to dispute. Despite the distinctly Minnesota weather, supporters turned out by the thousands on Sunday, cramming into a riverfront park wearing snow pants, ski goggles and parkas. Some even arrived on cross-country skis or brought dogs wearing coats. Asha Harris, 37, of Minneapolis, said the criticisms of the senator’s management style were plainly sexist. “When a woman is demanding and wants something and wants people to perform, it’s seen as difficult,” said Ms. Harris, who was still deciding which Democratic candidate to support. “I’ve had a lot of demanding bosses, male bosses, in my life, and nothing was said of them. They were told they were great leaders.” As snow accumulated on her coat and microphone, Ms. Klobuchar told the crowd that she would focus on reforming election laws, including a plan to automatically register people to vote when they turned 18. She also pledged to expand laws protecting online privacy. Her announcement caught the attention of Mr. Trump, who said on Twitter on Sunday afternoon: “Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for president, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing.” While her approach may appeal to centrists and moderate Republicans in her home state, her breaks with liberal orthodoxy risk alienating the ascendant progressive wing of her party. Ms. Klobuchar backs a less expansive college affordability proposal, has not embraced Senator Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for all” legislation and has not joined the movement to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Facing a relatively safe re-election race, Ms. Klobuchar spent most of the midterms promoting other Democrats running for office in her home state. She has made numerous visits to Iowa during her 12 years in office, most recently to push a message of “heartland economics” to rural residents and farmers, arguing that Democrats cannot afford to forget about the middle of the country. “Minnesota matters, Wisconsin matters, Nebraska matters, Ohio matters — and, yes, Iowa matters,” she told the Iowa Farmers Union in December. Ms. Klobuchar believes the contiguous location of her home state to Iowa could give her an advantage in the state’s caucuses, a crucial first test of the primary field. On Sunday, she quipped that the state is where Minnesotans “go south for the winter.” Ms. Klobuchar grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs as the daughter of a schoolteacher and a columnist for The Minneapolis Star Tribune. After graduating from Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, she returned to Minnesota to work as a corporate lawyer. The birth of her daughter, who was born with a condition that required her to remain in the hospital, plunged her into political activism. Ms. Klobuchar pushed for legislation that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay, a proposal that eventually became federal law. She was elected prosecutor for the state’s most populous county in 1998 and became the first elected female senator from her state in 2006. In the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has cultivated a worker-bee persona, not leading on divisive issues like immigration and focusing instead on curbing the cost of prescription drugs, addressing sexual harassment and protecting online privacy. A 2016 analysis found that she had passed the most laws of anyone in the Senate. Ms. Klobuchar rose to national prominence during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, when she pressed the nominee on whether he had blacked out drinking. “Have you?” he shot back, to which she calmly replied, “I have no drinking problem, Judge.” “When I turned on the TV and watched that hearing, I was so damn proud she was our senator,” said Gov. Tim Walz, one of several Minnesota officials who spoke at Ms. Klobuchar’s event. After she took the stage to chants of “Amy,” Ms. Klobuchar reminisced about her family ties to northern Minnesota’s mining-centric Iron Range. The region, once a Democratic stronghold, has remained supportive of Ms. Klobuchar even as Mr. Trump and other Republicans have made inroads. “I always liked Amy,” said Bob Vlaisavljevich, the Republican mayor of Eveleth, Minn., an Iron Range town with 3,700 residents, who said he voted for Ms. Klobuchar last year and posed for photos with her in front of the world’s largest free-standing hockey stick. “She’s just more reasonable, more accessible, more sympathetic to where we’re coming from on things.” Whether that bipartisan appeal would come through in a presidential election remains uncertain. If there were a Klobuchar-Trump matchup in 2020, Mr. Vlaisavljevich said he would probably lean toward the president. Mitch Smith reported from Minneapolis, and Lisa Lerer from Washington.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/trump-technology-overload.html---split---Supported by Or mine isn’t, anyway. By Jennifer Senior Opinion columnist I am trying to think about when, exactly, I realized that my brain was wretchedly ill suited to the modern world. Was it when Twitter began? With the internet itself? Certainly by this current presidency. I know that much. I think, for instance, of Fridays, often slow days in the news business, when journalists catch up on email and sneak out for haircuts and therapist appointments. Hard to do these days. Three Fridays ago, Roger Stone was hauled off by guys in blue windbreakers by sunrise and Donald Trump decided by 3 to reopen the government, ending the longest shutdown in history; two Fridays ago, the president suspended one of the last remaining arms control treaties, potentially reigniting the nuclear race. I am closing this piece on Friday morning. Not yet knowing what will happen, and how much will happen, fills me with an inexpressible relief. It should be noted that this problem of split-screen consciousness is likely to get worse in the era of divided government, not better. It won’t just be the president laying claim to our attention, but also those who are holding him to account. Even if our government were a paradigm of functionality, we’d surely be fighting for custody of our brains. In 2016, before Trump was elected, Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, examined the daily habits of 40 information workers. She discovered they checked their email 77 times per day, on average, and slalomed between screens every 47 seconds. Many evolutionary biologists are fond of pointing out that the human body is not adapted to modern life, which often involves sitting for hours at a time and toiling in artificial light and consuming mounds of processed sugar (“There’s no food in your food,” as the Joan Cusack character says in “Say Anything”). But the same design problem, it could be argued, is true of the human brain: It was not engineered to process the volume of information we’re getting, and at the rate we’re getting it. “Our brains evolved to help us deal with life during the hunter-gatherer phase of human history, a time when we might encounter no more than a thousand people across the entire span of our lifetime,” writes the neuroscientist Daniel Levitin in “The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload.” Recently, I phoned Levitin. He told me he suspects that humans during the Trump era are unwittingly re-enacting the rat experiments that James Olds and Peter Milner did in the 1950s, wherein the creatures repeatedly pressed a lever to feel an electric jolt to their reward centers. The poor subjects became such hostages to gratification that they stopped eating, drinking, even having sex. Eventually, they died of exhaustion. The business I’m in self-selects for those with a pretty high threshold for those jolts. I stare at my colleagues sometimes and marvel at what a different breed they are, the true exotics of the species: They’re like bugs with eyes all over their heads, evolved to take in several streams of information simultaneously. Walk by their desks, and it looks something like Norad. They’re staring at multiple screens fringed with multiple tabs, while Twitter, email and texts cascade down their phones. Whereas me? I’m a Cyclops. I tend to see one thing at a time. Before Trump, I could go days without looking at the newspaper. I’m partial to 19th-century novels, and I envy their heroines, who spend their days reading and needlepointing and playing piano. I find it far easier to tolerate the whistling emptiness of boredom than the casino rattle of too much stimulation. But to opt out of this clanging multiverse is to live in mild estrangement. It’s to feel one’s self become a permanent spectator; to live with the persistent sense that something is always happening elsewhere; to feel old, outlasted, outmatched by the bizarre physics of your own lifetime: The great spinning world has toppled off its axis and rolled away. It cannot be an accident that the lions of Silicon Valley, who live and die by the information whorl, are bullish on meditation. Bill Gates wrote a blog post a couple of months ago about it, praising the practice for focusing his busy mind. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey meditates, as we all learned from a string of insensitive tweets he recently unleashed from Myanmar. (It’s a fine line between mindfulness and mindlessness, apparently.) When the world’s coming at you in great clouds of 280-character Frisbees, naturally it’s tempting to vanish into the forest dark of your own mind. Of course, complaints about the unmanageable velocity of the world have been with us since industrialization, if not before. I once joked to my husband that I feared napping because I might miss an indictment. Turns out Henry David Thoreau made a similar complaint in the age of the telegraph. “Hardly a man takes a half-hour’s nap after dinner,” he wrote, “but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, ‘What’s the news?’ as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels.” I’m not convinced, as some people are, that the Twitter fusillades from the White House are part of a larger strategy of distraction, specifically intended to divert us from this particular administration’s malfeasance and failures. I think our president’s attention span is genuinely scattershot. (“Post-literate,” Michael Wolff called him in “Fire and Fury.” Seems about right.) When I imagine his brain, I imagine a bug zapper in a drizzle. Bzzzzzzzzzzt. Fzzzz. Bzzz fzzz bzzzzzzzzzzt. But Trump chaos, both intentional and otherwise, has proved a great de facto political strategy, precisely because we are neurologically incapable of handling it. The one thing we know about any interrupted activity is that it takes an awful lot of energy to return to whatever last had our attention. For what it’s worth, Gloria Mark says that women, in her research, tend to self-interrupt less frequently than men. Daniel Levitin says the same, and that we seem to have more glucose available to replenish our battered neurons than men do. It’s an argument for having an all-female White House press corps. (Maggie Haberman and Ashley Parker: Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.) Would that I were able to task-switch as they do. Would that we all could. Would that we all could return to the rhythms of a more civilized time, when we weren’t scanning the savanna for mortal threats every 30 seconds. It seems such an unfathomable luxury — almost as unfathomable as the Russians manipulating our elections, as a child billionaire selling our privacy down the river, as the Trump presidency itself.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/whitaker-trump-officially-declares-war-house-oversight---split---Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker leaves the House chamber Tuesday after President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) ANALYSIS — The Trump administration on Thursday moved its first chess piece in what is expected to be a contentious match between the White House and House Democrats as the latter seek documents and testimony for their oversight investigations of the president and his Cabinet. In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Thursday, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he would bail on his scheduled hearing on Friday unless Nadler assured him he would not file a subpoena to compel Whitaker to disclose his conversations with the president on hot-button topics or force Whitaker to invoke “executive privilege.” In another letter to the committee sent later in the day, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd set a 6 p.m. Thursday deadline for Nadler to notify the Justice Department whether or not he would file that subpoena, which the committee authorized as a pre-emptive measure on a party-line vote earlier in the day. As long as Whitaker is prepared to answer questions, “then I assure you that there will be no need for the Committee to issue a subpoena” on Friday, Nadler wrote in response. “To the extent that you believe you are unable to fully respond to any specific question, we are prepared to handle your concerns on a case-by-case basis, both during and after tomorrow’s hearing,” the New York Democrat wrote. Whitaker and Boyd’s letters Thursday are early indicators that the president’s legal team will take an aggressive approach to stall the disclosure of conversations between Trump and his advisers to House investigators. The questions Democrats want to ask Whitaker — outlined in a Jan. 22 letter to which the AG did not respond until Thursday — fall under “a category of communications that Administrations of both parties have viewed as raising confidentiality interests that are vital to a President’s ability to discharge the responsibilities of his office,” Whitaker wrote in his letter. Essentially, the argument for executive privilege goes, the president’s conversations with his advisers must remain confidential so that they can feel comfortable giving him candid advice. Democratic investigators can challenge executive privilege and compel disclosure by taking subpoenas and document requests to the courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that rules on questions of executive privilege has historically tended to side with investigators over the president. But that litigation process takes months. House Democrats only have two years of a guaranteed majority with which to investigate the administration. By arming themselves with a pre-emptive subpoena to dangle over Whitaker’s head on Friday during his voluntary testimony, the committee’s Democrats had hoped to expedite disclosure of his conversations with Trump. Whitaker is not budging for now, though. Nadler, Whitaker wrote in his letter Thursday, has “deviated from historic practice and protocol and taken the unnecessary and premature step of authorizing a subpoena” before the attorney general opted to decline to answer their questions in a voluntary appearance. That is true. In most cases, Congress and the administration have first negotiated over the disclosure of presidential communications after a witness initially declined to testify about them in a voluntary hearing. If those negotiations failed, Congress then issued a subpoena for the requested information. And in cases in which the administration rejected the subpoena, the president finally invoked executive privilege, setting up a battle in D.C. Circuit court over whether or not the information was protected. In 2004, the Supreme Court urged Congress and the executive branch to settle their disclosure disputes out of court. House Judiciary Republicans tried to block the Democrats’ subpoena authorization, citing its unprecedented nature. “Chairman Nadler and Democrats overplayed their hand,” ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia said. “In a quest to score political points against the president, they authorized a pre-emptive subpoena, treating a voluntary witness as hostile.” But Trump has openly attacked Democrats for their plans to conduct constitutionally mandated oversight of his administration, Democrats have been quick to point out, citing his State of the Union speech. Plus, they gave Whitaker two weeks’ notice to consult with Trump’s legal team on whether or not he would invoke executive privilege on his conversations with the president. Whitaker did not respond to that Jan. 22 notice until Thursday, well past Nadler’s 48-hour deadline before the scheduled hearing. And when he did respond, his letter indicated strongly that he would not disclose anything about what he and the president have talked about. Nadler is seeking answers about “confidential presidential communications no Attorney General could ever be expected to disclose under the circumstances,” Whitaker wrote in his letter Thursday. Whitaker’s first testimony in front of the committee is scheduled for Friday at 9:30 a.m. in the Rayburn House Office Building.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/trump-was-trying-to-channel-reagan-he-sounded-more-like-nixon---split---President Donald Trump gestures to House Democrats during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) OPINION — “The state of our union is strong.” It is the line that is prominently featured in the speech of every president when he (and so far, it’s been a he) stands before Congress for a political ritual that remains impressive. Political theater? Sure, and why not. A country without a monarch craves a little pomp now and again, no matter the partisan sniping that precedes and follows it. But what does that statement actually mean once the booming chants of “USA, USA” — which are sounding more aggressive than affirming lately — fade? It was in the news, briefly and certainly not prominently enough in a country that considers itself a beacon, that our government has misplaced children. The Trump administration has said it can’t guarantee that all the children and parents separated at the southern border will ever be reunited. In fact, while the political parties and the president haggle over the type and price of border security, the administration admits that bringing families back together is not a priority and may not be a possibility. Is that a sign of a strong union or one that has forgotten the values that make it strong? In response to an ACLU lawsuit challenging the government’s separation of thousands of children at the border since 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement shared that information, as well as the estimate of “thousands” of children, the number before the administration’s 2018 “zero tolerance” policy was put into place. Jonathan White, who heads HHS efforts to reunite parents with children placed in “sponsor” homes, said removing the children “would present grave child welfare concerns,” according to an Associated Press report. He said that “it would destabilize the permanency of their existing home environment, and could be traumatic to the children.” One would think the trauma occurred when children were taken from parents and placed with sponsors, be they other relatives or a foster family. But that cruelty, it would seem, was the point of a punitive policy to discourage migrants from seeking asylum at the southern border. The president’s speech Tuesday night doubled down on his rhetoric about the dangers of illegal immigration at the southern border that he believes should prompt quick action on his demands for a wall. His facts have been challenged — a lot. For example, though Trump uses El Paso, Texas, as a poster child for a barrier’s effectiveness, the county’s sheriff says the city was safe long before a wall was constructed. It’s more accurate to judge the speech less as a state of what our union believes than as a preview of the divisive social issues on which the 2020 presidential race will certainly be built whether or not a wall is. That the president’s properties recently have been firing members of their undocumented workforce proves just how cynical the message may be. What about the values of honesty and transparency? While Trump was reaching toward the lofty sentiments that marked the speeches of a Ronald Reagan, who, interestingly, was born on Feb. 6 in 1911, the president instead channeled former President Richard M. Nixon’s pre-resignation State of the Union, which cautioned against continuing the Watergate probe. You would think one of the president’s advisers would have warned him against risking that comparison by saying that one of the things standing in the way of America’s progress would be “ridiculous partisan investigations” — or, in other words, the House of Representatives doing its long-neglected duty of oversight of the executive branch. That comment resulted in one of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s more obvious eye rolls, and not even all of the usually applauding Republicans were on board. But while you could argue that the outreach was less than advertised and the partisan finger-pointing as strong as ever in the very long speech, Trump did tout a bipartisan success, one that took a first step in advancing criminal justice reform. It offers, perhaps, one hope for those hoping for something meaningful to get done in the two remaining years of the president’s first term, which will be chock-full of campaigning that will keep what seems like half of the Senate — including declared and undeclared candidates — busy. Stacey Abrams, in her Democratic response, presented her criticism with an optimistic face. Her opening, very human anecdote of her family, one that “went back and forth between lower middle class and working class,” illuminated the too often ignored black and brown folks who make up a large part of the hard-working, “working-class” American archetype. She mentioned party priorities — gun control, climate change, health care reform and more — that differ from the GOP agenda, and emphasized her leadership on the issue of voting rights that has Democrats and Republicans battling in states across the country. She also offered a challenge for the president she is “disappointed” in: “I still don’t want him to fail. But we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties, and respect the extraordinary diversity that defines America.” Returning to those all-American values — truth, justice, diversity — is a lot to ask of the same Donald Trump for whom the insult Tweet is an art form.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-blackmail.html---split---Supported by By Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON — Jeff Bezos understands survival instincts. As a hedge fund refugee, he conjured Amazon, the world’s biggest store, by tapping into our hunter-gatherer instincts, the compulsion to collect more stuff with less effort. Amazon became “the Prince of Darkness for retail,” Scott Galloway writes in “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google,” by exploiting our “serious mojo for stuff, as survival went to the cave man who had the most twigs, had the right rocks to crack stuff open with, and got the most colorful mud to draw images on walls so his descendants knew when to plant crops, or what dangerous animals to avoid.” So, of course, Bezos has finely honed survival instincts himself. This is a season when socialism is chic and billionaires are reviled as lame, immoral, greedy, lying and an Orange Menace (if he’s actually a billionaire). Yet the richest dude on earth has managed to come through a traumatic week inspiring admiration. He survived a spectacular attempt by David Pecker to ruin him in January with a National Enquirer story revealing his affair with his married neighbor, Lauren Sanchez, a TV personality. It was humiliating for him and his wife, MacKenzie, but Bezos was able to bring his marriage to an end with a modicum of dignity and little apparent damage to shareholder value. In our universe governed by algorithms, we can forget our nerdy overlords are actually human. Bezos’ sexts were brimming with romance: “I want to talk to you and plan with you. Listen and laugh.” Or another about his yearning to wake up next to her, have coffee and read the paper — The Washington Post, presumably. This past week, Pecker and his thugs upgraded to blackmail, threatening to print more sexts and louche pics that Bezos and Sanchez had exchanged unless Bezos made a statement in the press rebutting the idea that the Enquirer story was politically motivated. Again, Bezos’ superior survival instincts kicked in. He refused. Pecker is up to his slimy neck in politically motivated messes. He had to make a deal with prosecutors after he helped deliver his pal Donald Trump’s hush payments to the Playboy model and the porn star. The Dickensian-named head of American Media Incorporated, The Enquirer’s owner, was “apoplectic,” according to Bezos’ post in Medium, about his investigation into who leaked the texts. “I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out,” Bezos wrote. And thus a P.R. debacle turned into a triumph. Besides unbridled consumerism, Americans love nothing more than seeing a bully like Pecker get kicked in the groin. Bezos may be a key player in the Silicon Valley scheme to destroy privacy and ratchet up excess in the interest of mammonism, but for the moment, he’s a hero. “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion,” he wrote, “how many people can?” As Galloway told me: “The second-worst decision in the last 12 months was the world’s wealthiest man sending out pictures of his genitalia. The worst decision was A.M.I. deciding to attempt to blackmail the wealthiest man in the world via email. Dumb and dumber. “A.M.I. went out of business this week. They just don’t know it. They have a megalodon after them.” Galloway thinks that Bezos vs. Pecker will mimic Thiel vs. Gawker: “The same hubris infected Gawker, wrapping yourself in the First Amendment as an excuse for depraved behavior and ruining people’s lives. That dog will no longer hunt.” Bezos said there may be another rotten international conspiracy akin to the Russians and the Trump campaign — this one connecting Pecker, Trump and the Saudis. Just before Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to America, Pecker — who wanted the Saudis to help finance the purchase of Time magazine — published an absurd piece of checkout-aisle propaganda, a glossy magazine treating the prince like Beyoncé and calling his repressive, misogynist nation the “Magic Kingdom.” It highlighted the special relationship between the Saudis and Trump, who was also lavished with puff pieces in The Enquirer during the 2016 campaign. The crown prince has formed a tight bond with princeling Jared Kushner, one that proves ever more embarrassing as the evidence piles up that bin Salman ordered the horrendous murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The Times’s Mark Mazzetti revealed that the psycho prince told an aide in 2017 that he would use “a bullet” on Khashoggi if the writer did not stop his critiques. Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters Friday, “Mistakes happen.” Coining the word of the year, Bezos said that owning The Post is a “complexifier” for him, suggesting that the paper’s unrelenting coverage of the Khashoggi killing might have aggravated his testy relations with Trump. The Post reported that Michael Sanchez, Lauren’s brother who says he is also her manager — and who is close to Roger Stone and Carter Page — said he was told by several people at A.M.I. that The Enquirer wanted to do “a takedown to make Trump happy.” The toxic triangle of Pecker, the Saudis and Trumpworld has yet to unspool. But Galloway is right when he notes that, “despite the gross idolatry of billionaire innovators, he is an incredibly impressive person.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/change-makers-2019---split---Varshini Prakash co-founded the Sunrise Movement, an environmental group, in 2017. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images file photo) Several activists who will be on the front lines of some of the biggest policy battles in the year ahead rank among Roll Call’s People to Watch in 2019. They include the leader of a fledgling environmental group pushing for aggressive action on climate change; the new president of Planned Parenthood, the lightning rod in the raging debate over abortion; and an expert on transportation safety who will be insisting on strong regulations to prevent deaths and injuries from driver-less vehicles. In the political arena, the leaders of a grassroots progressive movement, already one of the most powerful activist groups today, hope to build on gains made last election cycle. By Elvina Nawaguna Just days after the 2018 midterm elections, hundreds of young, energized activists under the banner of a little-known environmental group stormed Capitol Hill, where they demonstrated outside of then-House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office. Their demands were clear and urgent: Global warming is changing the climate at an alarming pace and lawmakers need to take quick and aggressive action to stave off catastrophe. Behind that and subsequent demonstrations was 25-year-old Varshini Prakash, a Boston resident who co-founded the group, called the Sunrise Movement, in July 2017. In the weeks after Democrats won the House majority, Prakash and her group have returned to Capitol Hill several times and continued to pressure the party to adopt what it calls the Green New Deal, an ambitious action plan touted and made popular recently by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. The Green New Deal, which evokes President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1930s “New Deal” stimulus package, calls for an ambitious overhaul of the U.S. economy by weaning the country off fossil fuels within a decade of writing legislation, creating clean energy jobs both domestically and abroad as well as a series of social and environmental justice reforms. After that first protest, Pelosi announced she would create a select committee to address climate change in the new Congress, which appeared to be an early win for the young climate activists. But the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which Pelosi created, has been deemed “toothless” by the activists because it can only make recommendations to standing committees, and does not have the power to write bills or issue subpoenas. “We were really disappointed that Nancy Pelosi failed to create a Select Committee for a Green New Deal, even though she said it [climate] is an existential crisis,” Prakash says. “Calling it a crisis and treating it like one are different.” Still, Prakash’s group and its hundreds of activists can be credited with quickly elevating the conversation on climate change in Washington and forcing the new House Democratic majority to move the issue to the top of their agenda. Before her entry onto the national stage, Prakash was advocating for climate action as a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she earned bachelor’s degrees in environmental and political science. She led and coordinated fossil fuel divestment campaigns through an organization called the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, pushing the school to become the first public university to divest from direct fossil fuel investments. Her effort has received the nod from many environmental advocates who view young people as crucial to moving the needle on climate action, including from veteran activist and author Bill McKibben, saying in a Jan. 12 tweet that Sunrise Movement and Ocasio-Cortez understand the scale of action needed to address climate change, “especially since we waited so long” to start. “Everything has changed about how we discuss climate in the national debate,” Prakash says, adding that Democrats have quickly shifted from “half-measures” and “repeat propositions” to actually having conversations about how to rapidly transition the country to clean energy. Sunrise Movement is demanding that lawmakers who have taken donations from fossil fuel industries be precluded from joining the select committee or participating in climate legislation, forcing the party to grapple with an issue it has not had to deal with before. “The Democratic caucus I think is going to have to have this conversation because it hasn’t really come up before,” Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, chairwoman of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, told CQ in December. Despite its disappointments with House Democratic leadership, Prakash says, her group will work with the newly created committee to highlight the need for urgent climate action. But they are not limiting themselves to Capitol Hill. “It’s become clear that we need to take the campaign for a Green New Deal beyond the beltway,” Prakash says. “A large part of our strategy now will be making sure that any person or politician seeking federal office in 2020 must back the Green New Deal.” By Mike Magner Of all the groups focused on challenging President Donald Trump and his policies, one of the largest and fastest-growing is Indivisible, a grassroots movement started by a husband-and-wife pair of former congressional aides shortly after the 2016 election. Stories about how Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin’s “Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda” went viral online are now legend. Even more noteworthy is how the young Democratic couple seized the opportunity to put together one of the most powerful activist organizations in national politics today. More than 5,000 local chapters of Indivisible have been established, with at least one in every congressional district; the Washington headquarters has more than a million email addresses in its database; and the co-founders estimate that up to twice that many people identify themselves as members of an Indivisible group somewhere in the United States. According to Levin, Indivisible’s activists are united in the belief that democracy has been hijacked and they need to take it back. “There are people who disproportionately have not been involved really in politics before 2016, but after 2016 took it upon themselves to try to fix things,” he says. “That is the commonality.” The resistance guide that Greenberg, 32, and Levin, 33, posted on Dec. 14, 2016, gave those who were jolted by Trump’s election a handbook for turning angst into action by pressuring members of Congress and forcefully speaking out against a Washington agenda “built on racism, authoritarianism, and corruption.” Tactics outlined in the guide, such as facing down lawmakers at town halls, borrowed heavily from the tea party activists who gave Republicans control of Congress in 2010. That was no accident. Greenberg was an aide to Virginia Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello when he was swept out of office by the tea party wave, and Levin helped his hometown congressman, Democrat Lloyd Doggett of Austin, Texas, to the narrowest of his 12 election victories that year. Greenberg and Levin were just friends at that point, having met in Washington in 2008 at weekly get-togethers hosted by their fellow alums from Carleton College in Minnesota. The relationship blossomed as their career paths took them both through the Obama administration and to different policy groups, and they married in 2015. The lessons of the conservative wave in 2010 translated into a progressive wave in 2018 that gave Democrats the House majority. But Greenberg and Levin only see themselves as catalysts. “Leah and I aren’t traveling around the country like Johnny Appleseed for grassroots organizing and starting these new groups,” Levin says. “These are starting on their own. They’re made up of people who raised their hands and said, ‘OK, the system isn’t working. I guess I’ve got to do this.’” One surprising fact is how the movement sprouted even in the reddest states and congressional districts, Greenberg says. “One of the reasons why we hear from red-state groups that they’re really strong is just that you have a lot of people who spent most of their life thinking they were the crazy one,” she says. “And then suddenly they found people who thought like them. And that actually forms a really solid core for organizing.” Perhaps just as surprising is how Indivisible continues to grow, unlike the tea party that started to fade after its success eight years ago. The organization had its biggest show of activism on Jan. 3, with more than 160 events nationwide supporting HR 1, the pro-democracy bill introduced by Democrats on their first day running the House. Greenberg says Indivisible now has two main goals. “We need to win on as big a scale as we can in 2020,” she says. “The other thing is the problems didn’t start in 2016. We have to take on the fundamental things that were hurting democracy that allowed someone like Donald Trump to get elected. That means looking at the structural problems that are ailing democracy, such as the state of voting rights in this country, such as money in politics.” Levin says the top priority expressed by Indivisible members is fighting back against attacks on democracy. “We think there is this opportunity right now to push for fundamental reforms to American democracy to make it reflective of the will of the people. Because it’s not right now.” By Sandhya Raman Years ago, Leana Wen frequented Planned Parenthood with her family as a patient, and now as the organization’s new president, she is ready to put up a fight to protect its place in the health care system. “Planned Parenthood has been our lifeline, as it’s been for so many other people,” she says. “I also recognize that the ability to provide this care is threatened every day. … What other aspect of medicine is this true for?” In November, Wen, 36, became the first physician in five decades to lead the health care and advocacy organization. She took the helm at a time when the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have targeted the group, attempting to cut its funding and restrict abortion. But Wen sees an opening for change with Democratic control of the House this Congress. “This is the first time in nearly a decade that we have a reproductive-health majority in the House,” she says. “I look forward to working with them on protecting programs that we see under attack from the Trump administration.” Wen’s history of tangling with the administration goes back to her stint as the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, where in 2018 she successfully sued to block changes to the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program. Her top federal policy priority now is to prevent changes that would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving funds under Title X, the nation’s federal family planning grant program, unless the organization stops performing abortions. Title X provides care for 4 million individuals, and about 1.6 million of them use Planned Parenthood for well-woman exams, birth control and sexually transmitted disease screenings. “Planned Parenthood is a health care provider just like every health care provider that I have ever worked for,” says Wen, who notes that the group is working in coalitions with its partners to fight the Trump administration’s proposed changes to the program. Wen is also watching legal battles that could affect her group since the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh last year. She estimates that at least 20 cases that are one or more steps away from the Supreme Court could affect reproductive health access. The group had a recent victory when the high court declined to take up a case related to two states’ attempts to cut funding to Planned Parenthood. On the state level, her organization hopes to see repeals of laws she sees as discriminatory and the introduction of new bills to protect and expand access to reproductive care. “We have more governors elected this cycle than for decades that are pro-reproductive health,” she says, adding that 19 state legislatures and the District of Columbia support abortion rights. Eleven Planned Parenthood alumni, according to Wen, have been elected to office, including Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is a former vice president. “We’re so excited to have champions in state legislatures in the House and the Senate, and we’ll be working with them to fight,” she says. By Herb Jackson Cathy Chase is a 14-year veteran of battles to make roads safer for drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians, but she faced a new challenge in the last Congress as an effort to promote driverless cars shifted into high gear. Persuaded that the technology would create jobs and shrink the 37,000 annual highway fatalities, lawmakers considered bills to adapt federal safety standards and pre-empt state restrictions on the cars’ design and performance, approving them by voice votes in the full House and a Senate committee in 2017. But after a series of high-profile accidents involving vehicles in self-drive mode, including one that killed a pedestrian in Arizona, they began taking a closer look and the legislation stalled as the 115th Congress adjourned. With Democrats now controlling the House, the road map for a driverless car bill will be rewritten. Chase, 50, who became president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety in 2018, will be a key voice in convincing lawmakers to make safety protections a key part of it. “She’s probably been the lead advocate for ensuring the autonomous vehicle is introduced in a safe fashion,” says Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America and a board member of Chase’s group. In a lobbying world that often requires sharp elbows, he says Chase succeeds through her command of the subject. Rather than fight the technology, she pushes for better testing to ensure what’s being promised is what the public gets. Her record includes pressing for stronger truck safety rules, including limits on the time drivers spend on the road and the weight and length of double trailers. Driverless cars presented new challenges, she says, in part because they involved issues her group had never dealt with, such as cybersecurity. Chase says she initially took no position on the bills in the last Congress because she was trying to get support for improvements. “We thought if we came out in opposition, we wouldn’t be listened to,” she says. “But at one point, it felt like negotiations were not happening in earnest on our concerns, and we changed our position to opposition.” Chase supports — to the point of arguing they should be made mandatory for all cars now — some of the features manufacturers say will make driverless cars safer, such as automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning and blind-spot detection. But before Congress opens the door for mass production of driverless vehicles, there should be stronger regulations, and regulators need the power to enforce them, she says. “When you go to get a driver’s license, you need to pass a vision test,” she says. “But there’s no minimum standard to make sure a driverless car can see and respond to what’s happening in the road environment.” Chase says people have become complacent about the current rate of about 100 highway deaths a day in the U.S., thinking of them as accidents. The reaction to accidents with driverless cars is different. “It’s a stunning mind shift to think about the car itself doing the running over, versus a human,” she says.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/venezuelans-miami-republicans.html---split---Supported by By Patricia Mazzei MIAMI — For 60 years, the lifeblood of Miami’s idiosyncratic politics has been Cuba, the communist government’s countless sins denounced in street protests, dissected on the spirited Spanish-language airwaves and condemned at campaign rallies under the unifying cry of “Viva Cuba Libre!” But the focus of this city’s freedom-loving fervor has recently moved further south. Venezuela, not Cuba, now dominates Miami’s political conversation. A television anchor not long ago ended a somber segment with a promise to keep praying for the troubled South American country. Venezuelans in the city have gathered for demonstrations to coincide with protests back home. Even the Miami-Dade County Commission, a local body with no control over foreign policy, voted unanimously to recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. The shift has been coming on gradually for years, but it has accelerated in recent weeks as Venezuela has sunk further into crisis and its leftist president, Nicolás Maduro, has clung defiantly to power. The showdown in Caracas is reshaping Latino politics in South Florida, home to the highest concentration of Venezuelans in the United States. The change is not a mere demographic curiosity. In Florida, where major elections have repeatedly been decided by tiny margins, an inflection point around Venezuela’s leadership could help define a generation of Venezuelan-American voters, who number in the tens of thousands in this state. President Trump is pushing Mr. Maduro to step aside, and if he succeeds, Democrats fear it could transform Venezuelan-Americans into loyal Republicans, much like Cuban-Americans. “This could be Bay of Pigs 2.0,” said Liz Alarcón, a Venezuelan-American Democrat, referring to the C.I.A.-backed invasion of Cuba in 1961 that failed to overthrow Fidel Castro. The raid turned into a disaster, in part because President John F. Kennedy’s government did not provide sufficient air support to the Cuban exiles who made up the bulk of the invading force — and Florida’s Cuban community turned against both Mr. Kennedy and the Democratic Party. “It is very dangerous territory for Democrats,” State Senator Annette Taddeo of Miami, a Colombian-American and a Democrat, said of her party’s handling of the Venezuela issue. “Republicans are very smart about working on the margins. They know that a state like Florida is usually decided by 1 percent or less, so all they need are enough of the Venezuelans, enough of the Colombians, enough of the Puerto Ricans.” The influx of Puerto Ricans to the Orlando and Miami areas after Hurricane Maria in 2017 prompted some political analysts to make grand predictions about how the new arrivals would turn Florida blue in the midterms. Those forecasts overestimated the rate at which Puerto Ricans actually voted, and underestimated how successful Republicans would be in campaigning to them. Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist, predicted that Venezuela policy — especially if the crisis continues to drag on — could become a key Florida question for presidential candidates in the 2020 election, as Puerto Rico was in the 2018 midterms. “Foreign policy has always been deeply intertwined in the Florida political landscape and the outcome of elections,” said Mr. Ulvert, who is Nicaraguan-American and married to a Venezuelan. In South Florida, protesters have publicly shamed former members of the Venezuelan government in restaurants and angrily chanted outside Goldman Sachs when the bank purchased deeply discounted Venezuelan bonds, extending a financial lifeline to Mr. Maduro’s administration. When Mr. Trump announced last month he was recognizing Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim leader, thousands of Venezuelans gathered in a park outside Miami to voice their support. Ms. Alarcón, 30, said her fellow Democrats have been slow to react to Republican overtures not only to Venezuelans but also to other Democratic-leaning Latinos who fled authoritarian governments. They were especially alarmed when three liberal members of Congress — Representatives Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Ro Khanna of California and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — recently criticized the White House’s recognition of Mr. Guaidó and threats of more sanctions against Mr. Maduro. “A U.S.-backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face,” Ms. Omar wrote on Twitter, invoking a history of ill-received United States intervention against left-wing governments in Latin America during the Cold War years. But many Venezuelan exiles are exasperated to see Democrats opposed to intervening in the alarming humanitarian crisis in their country because of the lingering politics of the past. “This is not a coup!” Joanna Hausmann, a Venezuelan-American comedian in New York, declared in a video she filmed to explain the situation. “What tends to happen with Venezuelans is people have no idea why we’re here,” she said in an interview. Those who have fled the country, she said, are “running from dictatorship, from lack of food.” Ms. Hausmann, 29, whose uncle, a journalist, is under house arrest back home, said she was attacked on social media as a “right-winger” for agreeing with Mr. Trump on Venezuela policy, though she disagrees with him on most everything else. “I’m very disappointed in my liberal brethren,” she said. “Everything is distilled into, ‘Oh, Trump, and the history of coups in Latin America.’ It’s a completely different situation with a 25-year history.” The potential problem for Democrats is that a few dissenting voices from the left challenging Mr. Trump’s increasingly popular policy on Venezuela might be louder than the rest of the party, said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Miami, a Cuban-American Republican. “Just like when we’ve had instances on the immigration issue where a small group of Republicans will say things and that becomes the Republican narrative on immigration, Democrats now have a similar — and serious — problem,” he said in an interview. More top Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have thrown their support behind Mr. Guaidó over the past few days. Mr. Trump has said he is open to all options on Venezuela, including military ones. No Miami politicians, Republican or Democrat, favor armed conflict, but they have espoused bipartisan support for the president’s other statements so far. In a rare moment of unity, Mr. Diaz-Balart and four Democratic lawmakers from Miami and Orlando have introduced bills to restrict arm sales to Mr. Maduro’s government, grant Venezuelan immigrants temporary protected status, and provide the country with humanitarian aid. “This is very American, to support democracy,” said Representative Donna Shalala, a Democrat. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American Republican who has played a central role in crafting the Trump administration’s policy, said in an interview that critics from outside Florida who look at the issue through an old ideological prism often have an uninformed view of Venezuela: “Their history on this issue is maybe a week old.” He compared Miami’s ties to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital that is just a three-hour plane ride away, to inseparable cities along the southwest border. “The closest sort of analogy would be with border towns in Mexico, who are deeply dependent on cross-border trade,” Mr. Rubio said. He recalled attending a family friend’s wedding in the Venezuelan city of Valencia when he was younger. “You can’t live in Miami without knowing people in Venezuela.” Ernesto Ackerman, 69, a Venezuelan-American activist who came to the United States in 1989, long before Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, President Hugo Chávez, came into power, described the arrival of subsequent “tides” of Venezuelan immigrants. “If the problem gets solved,” said Mr. Ackerman, a Republican, “a lot of people are going to go back.” Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers insist that they back Venezuela action on principle, not as an electoral ploy. Yet Democrats saw politics at play this month when Vice President Mike Pence delivered a Venezuela policy speech in Doral — a Miami suburb known as Doralzuela — and did not invite Democratic members of Congress. Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump mentioned Venezuela in his State of the Union address and immediately pivoted to a campaign line that seemed to liken Venezuela’s socialist government to liberals in the United States. “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,” he said. During last year’s midterm elections, Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor, frequently deployed the word “socialist” against Mr. Gillum, his opponent. The jab, dismissed by Democrats as ridiculous, appeared to stick: Mr. DeSantis won. So did Rick Scott, a Republican who was elected to the Senate after working hard to court Venezuelans, Puerto Ricans and other Latinos who typically vote for Democrats. Florida’s Venezuelan community has a smattering of activists who are the heads of various organizations but no obvious leader — a reflection of an immigrant group still getting established, still up for grabs politically and still glued to the news from home, usually via Twitter posts or forwarded audio files on WhatsApp. “I’ve been sleeping maybe three hours a night,” said Yusnaiberth Detraux, 44, who described spending hours online scouring for information “until my eyes hurt.” Ms. Detraux, who left Venezuela 12 years ago and became a United States citizen last year, said she had lost hope until Mr. Guaidó came along, and the United States and its allies in the Western Hemisphere and Europe rallied behind him. Though she leans Republican, Ms. Detraux had not liked Mr. Trump at first. Then he delivered on his promised hard line on Venezuela. “Thank God we have this president,” she said. “At least he’s listened to us. Unfortunately, the previous administration did not.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei. Saul Martinez contributed reporting from Doral, Fla.   Advertisement
---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html---split---Advertisement UPDATED FEB. 10, 2019 They are thinking. Weighing. And, in many cases, already campaigning. It can feel like half the Democratic Party is setting off on a White House run. In fact, it’s only 11 or so, officially, but the next couple weeks could pad the field considerably. Below, an accounting of who’s in, who’s out and who’s somewhere in between. Running Would be one of the most gifted orators in the field, likely running on a politics of uplift that recalls President Obama’s 2008 campaign. Enjoys a vast fund-raising base, thanks to longstanding connections to donors around the country. Signature issues: Has been one of the leaders in the Senate on criminal justice reform, but his appeal would likely center on his call to unify the country. Began to draw national notice after delivering an essay that counseled Democrats on how to recover from their defeats in the 2016 elections. Has embarked on a long-shot campaign that may test the appeal of a youthful profile over more traditional qualifications. Signature issues: Has stressed his generational identity and called for policies on issues like climate and economic opportunity. Opted out of challenging Senator Ted Cruz for the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. Once a rising political star, has struggled to find a role during the Trump administration. Money could be an issue, especially if former Representative Beto O’Rourke, a small donor magnet, also mounts a bid. Signature issues: Has emphasized a platform of universal prekindergarten, “Medicare for all” and immigration reform. Was elected to the House in 2012 as a “pragmatic idealist,” in his telling. Has been running aggressively since 2017. Has already visited every county in Iowa, though it’s unclear if he has improved his long-shot prospects. Signature issues: Has pitched himself as a bipartisan problem-solver, but has also endorsed liberal causes like universal healthcare. Supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries. Has drawn condemnation for meeting with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, whose regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians. Has apologized for her history of anti-gay statements and her past work for an anti-gay advocacy group. Signature issue: Opposition to American military intervention overseas, including in countries like Syria. Was once a congresswoman from a conservative House district (with policy positions to match). Has transformed herself into a progressive champion in President Trump’s Washington, becoming one of the Senate’s leading liberal voices. Signature issue: Has long placed women’s equality and opportunity at the center of her policy agenda. Would bring a star power and history-making potential to the race that few other Democrats can match. One of few new Democrats to join the Senate after 2016. Quickly drew notice for her tough questioning of President Trump’s cabinet nominees — and later, his Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh. Signature issues: Unveiled middle-class tax cut legislation last fall, and has championed a liberal civil-rights agenda in the Senate. Became a hero to many Democrats for her stern, cool questioning of Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. Has called for Democrats to focus on reclaiming the swing states in the middle of the country. Signature issues: Has championed legislation to combat the opioid crisis and drug addiction, and to address the cost of prescription drugs. Has done some of the most extensive preparations for a presidential run. Attempted to dispatch questions about her Native American heritage by releasing the results of a DNA test. That effort raised questions about her readiness for a national bid. Signature issues: Income inequality and what she sees as a middle class under attack from big corporations and political corruption. The author of more than dozen self-help and spirituality books. Ran for Congress as an independent in 2014, and lost. Championed the rights of gay men with AIDS, founding a charity that now supplies meals to people with serious illnesses. Signature issues: Has proposed $100 billion in reparations for slavery, with $10 billion to be distributed annually over a decade for economic and education projects. Is running a long-shot campaign on a proposal to establish a universal basic income funded by the government. Has drawn some media attention for highlighting tech issues like robotics and artificial intelligence. Signature issue: Establishing a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for all Americans. All But Certain A political moderate with a record of success in a purple state. A former geologist who struck it rich when he opened a brewery in Denver. Will likely cast himself as someone who can attract support for a broad coalition, though some of his victories entailed cutting deals with the Republican business establishment. Signature issues: Has stressed his record of consensus-building around issues like expanding Medicaid, gay rights and gun control. Likely to Run Has run for president twice before. Is among the best-liked figures in the Democratic Party, known for his down-to-earth personality and his ability to connect with working-class voters. Regards 2020 as his last chance to run for president. Signature issues: Restoring America’s standing on the global stage; strengthening economic protections for low-income workers in industries like manufacturing and fast food. Democratic governor of a state that Mr. Trump won easily in 2016. Would offer himself as a bridge to rural America. Came out in favor of an assault weapons ban, despite overseeing a state that prizes its hunting. Signature issues: Expected to make campaign finance reform central, while also pushing early childhood education and other policies aimed at reducing economic inequality. A self-described democratic socialist. Was the runner-up in the 2016 Democratic primary. Would begin a second White House race with a more extensive organization-in-waiting than any other candidate. Might face difficulties retaining the same level of support he enjoyed in what was effectively a head-to-head race against Hillary Clinton. Signature issues: Will likely run on “Medicare for All,” free college tuition and curtailing the influence of, as he calls them, “the billionaires.” Might Run Has flirted with mounting a bid for president for more than a decade. Re-registered as a Democrat in October, nearly two decades after he left the party to run for mayor as a Republican. Has voiced stark disagreements with progressives on issues including bank regulation, stop-and-frisk police tactics and the #MeToo movement. A rare Ohio Democrat who found success in a once-purple state shading red. Could make the case that his fiery economic populism and liberal record are a compelling fit for a party that needs to reassemble a coalition of Midwestern states that Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Is a fierce Trump critic on effectively every issue but one: trade. A two-term governor known for his environmental policies. Has become one of the party’s most forceful climate advocates, calling on Democrats to embrace a green-energy jobs program. Has also left the door open to running for a third term as governor, since Washington State does not have term limits. Controversial decision to remove his city’s Confederate monuments vaulted him into the national political conversation. Has drawn considerable attention from Democratic donors and political strategists, and could be a formidable candidate in the South. Has repeatedly said, in public and private, he is unlikely to run. A fixture in Democratic Party politics who became a successful governor. Would highlight the economic record and social policies he’s championed, which include legalizing gay marriage and restoring felon voting rights. Some around him are unsure whether there’s a road to the presidency for an establishment white male politician with close ties to the Clinton family. Exploded onto the national scene in June 2018 with a viral video showing him being refused entry to a facility in Texas where migrant children were being held. Was the lone senator to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2016 and is hoping to harness some of that progressive energy. Democrats in his home state showed little interest in changing an existing law so that he could be on the ballot for both the Senate and the presidency in the same year. Became a celebrity of Democratic politics in the Trump age, and narrowly lost to Senator Ted Cruz in 2018. Has delivered a message of national unity and red-state liberalism via constant social media livestream to voters inside and outside of Texas. Any success in 2020 would draw from this viral appeal, particularly to younger Democrats, and from the small-dollar fundraising army it has earned him. Has long mused about making the jump from the boardroom to politics. Remains to be seen whether a wealthy executive could find success with Democratic primary voters. A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” has come under fire from fellow party members as well as President Trump for taking steps to prepare to run for president as an independent. Unlikely to Run A moderate Democrat known for bipartisanship. Does not have nearly the national profile of some Senate peers considering a run, but is weighing whether there is room in the field for a less fiery Democrat. Has refused to publicly rule out mounting a third bid for the presidency. While some longtime allies quietly push the idea, others close to her say she has little interest in running again. Could credibly make the case that he has fused liberal policy feats like universal prekindergarten with falling crime and a sturdy economy. Past forays into national politics, like a progressive non-profit and a halting endorsement of Hillary Clinton, have ended in disaster. A career prosecutor who has never run for office before. Tried his hand at campaigning for fellow Democrats in the midterm elections and appeared to like it, but unclear if he is prepared to actually put his own name on the ballot. The 2004 Democratic nominee and President Obama’s chief diplomat. Author of a recent memoir about his life and, at 75, was thought to be done with politics. Is deeply upset about the Trump presidency and has indicated he would like to continue to play a role in public life. Not Running By ALEXANDER BURNS, MATT FLEGENHEIMER, JASMINE C.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., left, and Richard Shelby, R-Ala., attend a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing in Russell Building on nominations on July 26, 2018. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Negotiations on a border security deal have hit a snag in a dispute over immigrant detention policy, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby said Sunday. House and Senate conferees were scrambling to reach a deal by Monday that would resolve the impasse over President Donald Trump’s demand for a border wall and avoid another partial government shutdown when current funding runs dry on Feb. 15. But Shelby put the odds of a deal at only “50-50,” citing a partisan rift over Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. “The talks are stalled right now,” the Alabama Republican said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We’ve got some problems with the Democrats dealing with ICE that is detaining criminals that come into the U.S. They want a cap on them. We don’t want a cap on that.” Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “you absolutely cannot rule out” a shutdown. Watch: As lawmakers begin to hash out border security, how do conference committees work?  Trump has sought enough bed space to house an average daily population of 52,000 migrant detainees; House Democrats want to cut that to 35,520 for the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, phasing out family detention completely by then. A bipartisan Senate version of the Homeland Security bill, approved last June on a 26-5 vote, would have provided funding for 40,520 detention beds. The latest dispute centers on a Democratic demand to cap the number of detention beds available for undocumented immigrants arrested when they are already inside the U.S., as opposed to those arrested when trying to cross the border. Democrats are seeking a cap of 16,500 beds for those arrested inside the country. Republicans have refused to make a counteroffer to the Democrats’ most recent border security proposal until that demand is dropped, according to a Democratic aide. “So we are not talking right now,” the aide said. The aide said 16,500 is the level of such arrests from the last three months of President Barack Obama’s administration. By contrast, the comparable level for the Trump administration of late has been roughly 20,700, or about 25 percent more than in late 2016. “A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country,” House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday. Republicans have said they would agree to such a cap only if it excludes criminals from the count, a senior GOP aide said. But that condition would make the cap “totally useless,” the Democratic aide said. In a Sunday afternoon tweet, Trump gave his assessment of the current state of play. “The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally,” he wrote. “Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don’t even want to take muderers (sic) into custody! What’s going on?” The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody! What’s going on?  The 16,500 cap on detainees arrested inside U.S. borders was initially included in the House Democrats’ Homeland Security spending proposal outlined on Jan. 31. Lawmakers were still wrestling with how much money to provide for physical barriers along the border, as sources said the final figure could hover somewhere around $2 billion. That would be less than half of the $5.7 billion Trump has sought this fiscal year for his border wall. Mulvaney, appearing also on Fox, declined to say whether Trump would sign a bill that includes about $2 billion for border barriers. He said the White House message to negotiators was, “We’ll take as much money as you can give us,” but the administration would seek to supplement that amount on its own. Mulvaney said the administration could tap other funds through reprogramming and still has the option of redirecting additional money by declaring a national emergency. If all such options were used, he said, “The whole pot is well north of $5.7 billion.” Lawmakers of both parties have counseled Trump against declaring an emergency to fund the wall, saying it would set a troubling precedent that could be abused by future presidents. Mulvaney said the emergency option remains on the table but Trump “would prefer legislation because it’s the right way to go.” Democrats have been reluctant to provide any more than the $1.6 billion for border barriers that was part of a bipartisan Senate Homeland Security bill last year. But in recent days, they have expressed a willingness to consider more money for “enhanced fencing” if it were part of a package that included more funding for personnel and technology improvements on the border. “Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through,” Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said on Fox. “I’m very hopeful, not positive, but very hopeful we can come to an agreement.” But Mulvaney said he wasn’t sure how much money Democrats were willing to bring to the table for border security. “I don’t think they know where they stand on this particular issue, and I think that’s one of the reasons why we’re having a difficulty coming to a deal,” he said. A deal on border security would clear the way for passage of seven unfinished spending bills for the fiscal year that began last October. The bills, which amount to about $320 billion in discretionary spending, are the Homeland Security, Agriculture, Financial Services, Transportation-HUD, State-Foreign Operations, Commerce-Justice-Science, and Interior-Environment measures. Shelby said Monday remains the deadline for a deal by the House-Senate conference committee that is negotiating a Homeland Security bill. “I’m not confident we’re going to get there,” he said. “I’m hoping we’ll get there. The next 24 hours are crucial.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

After Congress in 2007 failed to pass comprehensive immigration overhaul, Bhojwani in 2010 founded New American Leaders (NAL) an organization that works across the country to train first- and second-generation Americans to run for public office. Bhojwani, 51, who was born in India, raised in Belize and is now a U.S. citizen, says the organization seeks to put more people in office who will accurately reflect the communities they represent. “We need people like ourselves fighting for policies that work for us,” she says in an interview. “My idea was to both build a pipeline of people who could run for local and state office right away and produce a policy environment that worked better for immigrant communities, but then also build this pipeline to Congress.” NAL has trained more than 600 people since 2011, and 70 have so far achieved public office. In the 2018 midterm elections, nine won state legislature seats, five won in city councils, seven were elected to school boards, and seven more received various political appointments. No NAL alum has yet been elected to serve in Congress, although Bhojwani was clearly moved by the wave of immigrants and first-generation Americans who ran last year and succeeded including Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. “We have to be our strongest advocates,” she says. Bhojwani said Tlaib and Omar were largely successful because they reached out to young voters who felt ignored. Both joined the NAL network after they were elected to office. Bhojwani came to the U.S. as a college student to attend the University of Miami and observed how newer citizens weren’t adequately represented in government, and how immigrant voices were routinely ignored. Before founding NAL, she served as New York City’s first Immigrant Affairs commissioner and created the South Asian Youth Action group, which is a community advocacy and empowerment group for immigrants from the subcontinent. Bhojwani says her work in that job showed her the importance of bringing a mix of voices into government institutions where policy is made. “As a commissioner in government I was able to see what it meant to have a diverse voice at the table. I bring my own lived experience,” she says. Bhojwani says many people working with the organization are hesitant to run at first because they do not think they have a big political network or enough financial backing to quit full-time jobs. To counter that reluctance, NAL holds training sessions across the country every year that teach potential candidates about campaign finance, how to effectively communicate their messages and how to amplify their immigrant backgrounds to gain support from local communities and mobilize people to go out and vote. The organization also teaches people how to identify and use the small networks where they already belong. The organization trains people who are affiliated with all political parties. Although it doesn’t train individuals on policy issues, it does advocate for a comprehensive immigration overhaul that “values families and family reunification and allows for humane treatment of people seeking protection at our border.” The organization encourages potential candidates to own their stories and embrace their immigrant roots to connect with voters from diverse backgrounds. Bhojwani says the spike in first- and second-generation Americans running for office is a result of the 2016 presidential election, but not for the expected reasons. “There was this sense that if [Donald Trump] can do it, then so can I,” Bhojwani says. “We hear from a lot of folks that say they don’t feel like they want to run because they’re more of a behind-the-scenes person, or they say that people like them are not elected to office. But, having watched someone who has no qualification to be president running, I think that did give people permission to say, ‘Oh, well, so can I.’ ” Bhojwani hopes that the organization will continue to expand and will eventually change the way all levels of government are run — from Congress to the town council. “We have a system that was designed for an America that our founding fathers envisioned, and now we have a very different America and it’s really up to us to build a system that’s going to work for that modern, more multiracial America in which it’s not OK for a small group of people to make decisions on behalf of millions of Americans,” she says. By Jacob Fischler Gurbir Grewal didn’t come into the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office spoiling for fights with the Trump administration, but that’s how he ended up spending his first year in office. In an era of unified Republican government in Washington, Grewal, 45, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, saw his office providing a last line of defense for New Jersey against the most controversial and consequential of President Donald Trump’s actions on virtually every policy front. “We saw ourselves, because there was no check on the administration, as being that check — to make sure if they violated rules and norms, if they didn’t follow procedures, that we held them accountable,” the former federal prosecutor says. “But what I would like to make clear is: We weren’t reflexively anti-Trump or anti-administration.” Instead, when evaluating whether to challenge an administration action, he says his office applied a two-part test: Did the action violate a law, rule or norm? And, more importantly, did it affect New Jersey residents? Throughout the year he and his staff found themselves “answering yes to both those questions” at an alarming rate, he says. In states like Minnesota and Colorado, the 2018 campaigns of several Democratic nominees for attorney general mirrored Grewal’s aggressive approach to the administration, especially on immigration and health care. No one in New Jersey before Grewal had harnessed the attorney general’s office to go as directly after the federal government. Changing the mission and the mindsets of 8,000 workers there was one of the primary challenges of his first year, he says. He used a similar management style in his previous job as Bergen County prosecutor, a position he was appointed to by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. “He’s a real prosecutor; he’s not a politician,” says Gerald Krovatin, a high-powered defense attorney in the state. “And yet now, in his current position, he’s done a great job of using the power and prestige of that office to pursue progressive policy goals.” He’s likely to continue that record, but with less focus on direct confrontation with Washington and more on using the office’s rule-making power to change New Jersey policy. The Garden State is somewhat unusual in that its attorney general is appointed, not elected. The office is also more powerful than the national norm, with control of the state’s law enforcement bureaucracy and much of its regulatory enforcement. Moving into 2019, the new Democratic majority in the U.S. House can serve as a check on the administration, a role Democratic state attorneys general played in Grewal’s first year, he says. That will free his office to craft its own policy on consumer issues, environmental protection, the student loan industry and law enforcement operations. An early example was a directive Grewal issued in November, telling state and local police to limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. The move drew criticism from federal officials. Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says the directive itself created a safe haven for criminals and put public safety at risk. Grewal calls that reaction “disappointing.” The son of Indian immigrants and the first Sikh attorney general in the U.S., Grewal talks about the “human face” of immigration enforcement and has taken steps to protect immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But the immigration directive was based more on his experience as a prosecutor. As a federal prosecutor Grewal worked well with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a variety of cases and says he has “nothing against” the agency. But as a county prosecutor and early in his tenure as attorney general, he saw a “shift in immigration enforcement,” including sweeps near schools and other sensitive areas, he says. The change scared witnesses away from testifying in domestic violence cases, for example, and undermined prosecutors’ work. As the office shifts into more of a rule-making mode, he says other directives may be coming, including on law enforcement use of force: “We can push forward now our own agenda instead of pushing back at what’s coming out of Washington.” By Ellyn Ferguson Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland spent a recent Saturday morning welcoming teenage Saudi asylum-seeker Rahaf Alqunun at the Toronto airport. The 18-year-old had lobbied for protection on social media, claiming physical abuse by her family, who she said was forcing her into an arranged marriage. She fled her home and made it to Thailand before accepting Canada’s offer of refuge. “It was a pleasure for me this morning to welcome to her new home a very brave new Canadian,” Freeland said Jan. 12. The action was par for the course for Freeland, who as part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party government, is establishing her country as a global human rights leader. It was also gutsy, coming amid rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Canada. Freeland, 50, and a native of the province of Alberta, entered Canadian politics in 2013 after a career as a news executive at the Financial Times, The Globe and Mail and Thomson Reuters. A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar, she speaks English, French, Ukrainian, Russian and Italian. She joined the cabinet first as international trade minister in 2015 then moved to the foreign affairs spot in 2017. She seems to relish being the point person for the Trudeau government on foreign policy, trade and more recently on human rights and gender equality, and has not been shy about standing up to Washington. She has chided the Trump administration for retreating from the world stage and declared that Canada will uphold the values of internationalism. “I think they (Canadians) probably view us as becoming a little bit more insular and inwardly focused,” former Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican, told CQ before he retired from the Senate in January. “I find them continuing to be fairly robust in the outward efforts and probably like other countries, Europe and other places, feel like there is somewhat of a vacuum [in the U.S.]” Corker, who met with Freeland several times during negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, said he found her “very direct” and a strong advocate for Canada. “There’s no gamesmanship,” he said. Freeland has used her Twitter account to call out governments, most recently slamming Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro. “Having seized power through fraudulent and anti-democratic elections held on May 20, 2018, the Maduro regime is now fully entrenched as a dictatorship,’’ she tweeted last month. On human rights, Canada and the United States have sharply differed in their response to alleged human rights abuses by the Saudis. In 2018, Canada publicly challenged Saudi Arabia about arrests of activists for women’s rights and civil society and called for their release. The Saudis responded by ordering Canada’s ambassador to leave the country and threatening to shut Canada out of future business deals and contracts. It’s a stark contrast to the reactions of President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. After the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump and Pompeo declined to back the findings of the CIA that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew of and possibly ordered the killing. Both have resisted congressional efforts to punish the kingdom over Khashoggi’s death and the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, where 15.9 million people, 53 percent of the population, face “severe acute food insecurity,” and famine looms, according to the United Nations. On trade, Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer negotiated hard as Canada fought several U.S. proposals during talks to revamp the 1994 NAFTA before reaching an agreement that still must be ratified. Freeland told interviewers at the time that the last hours of negotiations were so intense that she lay on the floor of the prime minister’s office in exhaustion at the end. The Angus Reid Institute, a nonpartisan polling and research organization in Canada, awarded her the top performance score among Trudeau’s ministers last year. But Freeland and Trudeau say there is still unfinished business. They want the U.S. to lift a 25 percent steel tariff and a 10 percent aluminum tariff on Canadian products the Trump administration imposed on most imported foreign steel and aluminum in the name of economic and national security. “They are protectionism pure and simple,” Freeland said of the tariffs when she accepted Foreign Policy’s 2018 Diplomat of the Year award. “They are not a response to unfair actions by other countries that put American industry at a disadvantage. They are a naked example of the United States putting its thumb on the scale in violation of the very rules it helped to write.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---10.0---split---https://play.google.com/?hl=en---split---Over 1 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. • A New York Times bestseller for over a decade • Over 7.4 million copies sold in the U.S. • Translated into 40 languages worldwide “Don Miguel Ruiz’s book is a roadmap to enlightenment and freedom.” — Deepak Chopra, Author, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success “An inspiring book with many great lessons.” — Wayne Dyer, Author, Real Magic “In the tradition of Castaneda, Ruiz distills essential Toltec wisdom, expressing with clarity and impeccability what it means for men and women to live as peaceful warriors in the modern world.” — Dan Millman, Author, Way of the Peaceful Warrior Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie. As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life.

In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.

"Sims’s vivid portrait of Trump shrewdly balances admiration with misgivings, and his intricate, engrossing accounts of White House vendettas and power plays have a good mix of immersion and perspective. The result is one of the best of the recent flood of Trump tell-alls." —Publishers Weekly The first honest insider’s account of the Trump administration. If you hate Trump you need the truth; if you love Trump you need the truth. After standing at Donald Trump’s side on Election Night, Cliff Sims joined him in the West Wing as Special Assistant to the President and Director of White House Message Strategy. He soon found himself pulled into the President’s inner circle as a confidante, an errand boy, an advisor, a punching bag, and a friend. Sometimes all in the same conversation. As a result, Sims gained unprecedented access to the President, sitting in on private meetings with key Congressional officials, world leaders, and top White House advisors. He saw how Trump handled the challenges of the office, and he learned from Trump himself how he saw the world. For five hundred days, Sims also witnessed first-hand the infighting and leaking, the anger, joy, and recriminations. He had a role in some of the President’s biggest successes, and he shared the blame for some of his administration’s worst disasters. He gained key, often surprising insights into the players of the Trump West Wing, from Jared Kushner and John Kelly to Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. He even helped Trump craft his enemies list, knowing who was loyal and who was not. And he took notes. Hundreds of pages of notes. In real-time. Sims stood with the President in the eye of the storm raging around him, and now he tells the story that no one else has written—because no one else could. The story of what it was really like in the West Wing as a member of the President’s team. The story of power and palace intrigue, backstabbing and bold victories, as well as painful moral compromises, occasionally with yourself. Team of Vipers tells the full story, as only a true insider could. *The first novella from Radicalized* Unauthorized Bread is a tale of immigration, the toxicity of economic and technological stratification, and the young and downtrodden fighting against all odds to survive and prosper. “If you thought that there was no reason left for living after the end of the Sorcerer’s Ring series, you were wrong. In RISE OF THE DRAGONS Morgan Rice has come up with what promises to be another brilliant series, immersing us in a fantasy of trolls and dragons, of valor, honor, courage, magic and faith in your destiny. Morgan has managed again to produce a strong set of characters that make us cheer for them on every page.…Recommended for the permanent library of all readers that love a well-written fantasy.” --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos  The #1 Bestseller!  From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes a sweeping new epic fantasy series: RISE OF THE DRAGONS (KINGS AND SORCERERS—Book 1).  Kyra, 15, dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, even though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. As she struggles to understand her special skills, her mysterious inner power, she realizes she is different than the others. But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her to wonder who she really is.  When Kyra comes of age and the local lord comes to take her away, her father wants to wed her off to save her. Kyra, though, refuses, and she journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragon—and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever.  15 year old Alec, meanwhile, sacrifices for his brother, taking his place in the draft, and is carted off to The Flames, a wall of flames a hundred feet high that wards off the army of Trolls to the east. On the far side of the kingdom, Merk, a mercenary striving to leave behind his dark past, quests through the wood to become a Watcher of the Towers and help guard the Sword of Fire, the magical source of the kingdom’s power. But the Trolls want the Sword, too—and they prepare for a massive invasion that could destroy the kingdoms forever.  With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, RISE OF THE DRAGONS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, of ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders.  Book #2 in KINGS AND SORCERERS is now available!  “RISE OF THE DRAGONS succeeds—right from the start…. A superior fantasy…It begins, as it should, with one protagonist's struggles and moves neatly into a wider circle of knights, dragons, magic and monsters, and destiny.…All the trappings of high fantasy are here, from soldiers and battles to confrontations with self….A recommended winner for any who enjoy epic fantasy writing fueled by powerful, believable young adult protagonists.” --Midwest Book Review, D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself "the angriest Black man in America" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind.  An established classic of modern America, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" was hailed by the New York Times as "Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book." Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcom X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared. Of Mice and Men also represents an experiment in form, as Steinbeck described his work, “a kind of playable novel, written in novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. Benedict Cumberbatch reads these four new Sherlock Holmes stories by John Taylor 'An Inscrutable Masquerade'/ 'The Conundrum of Coach 13'/ 'The Trinity Vicarage Larceny'/ 'The 10.59 Assassin' Inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes stories, John Taylor has written four more mysteries featuring the world’s greatest detective. Read by acclaimed actor Benedict Cumberbatch, these new adventures share all the suspense of the original tales. In a drawer in his bureau, Dr Watson keeps a locked cedarwood chest – a ‘box of secrets’. It contains an archive of notes referring to some of Holmes’ cases that, for one reason or another, never saw the light of day. Now, for the first time, Watson has decided to reveal the truth to the world... In these four thrilling stories, Holmes experiments with the science of ballistics, locates some missing gold bullion, investigates the theft of a large amount of money and solves the baffling mystery of the Stovey murder. Learn how you can apply the main lessons & principles from The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck in a quick, easy listen!  For a considerable length of time, we've been informed that positive reasoning is the way to an upbeat, rich life. "F**k energy," Mark Manson says. "Let's be realistic, shit is f**ked and we need to live with it." In his uncontrollably mainstream Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat. He comes out with the plain truth—a measurement of crude, reviving, genuine truth that is painfully deficient with regards to today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his remedy to the cosseting, let's-all-vibe great outlook that has tainted present day society and ruined an age, compensating them with gold decorations only to appear.  Manson makes the contention, supported both by scholastic research and all around coordinated crap jokes, that enhancing our lives pivots not on our capacity to transform lemons into lemonade,instead on figuring out how to stomach lemons better. Individuals are defective and constrained—"not every person can be uncommon, there are victors and washouts in the public eye, and some of it isn't reasonable or something that you can control." Manson encourages us to become more acquainted with our confinements and acknowledge them. When we grasp our feelings of trepidation, issues, and vulnerabilities, when we quit running and staying away from and begin standing up to difficult facts, we can start to discover the bravery, persistence, trustworthiness, duty, interest, and absolution we look for.  There are just such huge numbers of things we can give a f**k about so we have to make sense of which ones extremely matter, Manson clarifies. While cash is pleasant, thinking about what you improve, on the grounds that genuine riches is about involvement. A truly necessary snatch you-by-the-shoulders-and-look at you without flinching snapshot of genuine talk, loaded up with engaging stories and indecent, merciless funniness, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a reviving slap for a generation to enable them to lead lives that have true meaning.   This audio captures the key takeaways found in the original book. All fluff and unnecessary information has been removed to save you hours of time. If you've already read the original, this audio will help you cement the most important lessons. If you haven't, don't worry, here you will find all the practical information that you can apply.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html---split---Supported by By Emily Cochrane, Maggie Haberman and Eric Schmitt WASHINGTON — Bipartisan talks to reach a border security agreement have stalled, lawmakers and aides said on Sunday, imperiling efforts to prevent another government shutdown days before the Friday deadline. Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a key figure in the negotiations, confirmed the impasse on Sunday, saying that he was “not confident we’re going to get there.” “I’ll say 50-50 we get a deal,” Mr. Shelby said, speaking on “Fox News Sunday.” “The specter of a shutdown is always out there.” The 17 House and Senate lawmakers negotiating, known as a conference committee, had set an informal deadline of Monday to reach a deal, because Congress would need that much time to consider the legislation without waiving procedural rules and still pass it by Friday, when funding for several departments and agencies expires. But an aide familiar with the talks said lawmakers had stopped communicating. The hang-up was not primarily the amount of funding for a border barrier, but a Democratic effort to force Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on detaining migrants with criminal records instead of people who have overstayed their visas by limiting the number of beds it has in detention centers. President Trump, weighing in on Twitter, blamed Democratic leadership for the impasse. “I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal,” he wrote. “They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!” While Democrats refused to entertain the prospect of fulfilling Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall, lawmakers had grown closer to accepting a number between $1.3 billion and $2 billion for physical barriers. But they also demanded the number of beds for ICE, which detains immigrants who are already in the country, be limited to 16,500. President Trump says construction for the wall is underway. We mapped the current fencing and what his administration has done so far. . Republicans balked at the limitation, refused to accept the latest offer from Democrats and have yet to make a counteroffer, according to an aide familiar with the negotiations. “How in the world after that speech does he sign a bill that would reduce the bed spaces available for violent offenders?” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president, referring to Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address. Speaking on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News, he added, “He can’t do that, he won’t do that and you can take that to the bank.” Still, Mr. Shelby and Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana and a member of the conference committee, said on Sunday that they had not given up on reaching a deal. Democratic conferees held a conference call on Sunday morning to discuss options, according to a Democratic aide, but did not settle on a final decision on how to move forward. The breakdown in negotiations came as Pentagon and administration officials were preparing for two situations: another partial government shutdown or the president, unsatisfied with an agreement produced by the bipartisan panel, fulfilling his threat to declare a national emergency. Mr. Trump has told allies that while he would grudgingly accept a border security figure of about $2 billion, he was still considering using his executive authority to declare an emergency. “The Wall will get built one way or the other!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday afternoon. In what one Defense Department official described as a surreal scramble over the weekend, Pentagon officials met on Friday and over the weekend to identify which Army Corps of Engineers construction projects would be tapped for money to help build Mr. Trump’s wall if the president declared a national emergency. Officials pored over the language of multiple draft declarations that Mr. Trump might invoke if a deal is not reached or he rejects what lawmakers agree upon. Mr. Trump’s top national security aides — the so-called principals committee — are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss that matter. Mr. Trump is then to convene a full National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, officials said. If Mr. Trump declares a national emergency to build the wall, critics are expected to file suit in court to block construction and halt any funds shifted to the project. Democratic lawmakers, particularly in the House, are also preparing legislation that would limit the president’s ability to do so. To stave off a court challenge, one proposal circulating among some White House officials, including those close to Stephen Miller, the president’s top domestic policy adviser, is to claim that the wall would be built to protect the more than 5,000 active-duty troops now operating near the southwestern border or deploying there soon.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-extends-order-asylum-seekers-southwest-border---split---President Donald Trump delivered the State of the Union address, with Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, at the Capitol in Washington, DC on Feb. 5, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times) President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Thursday evening that extends for 90 days his November order barring migrants who arrive outside points of entry at the U.S. Mexico border from requesting asylum. The courts have blocked implementation of the first order. In his new proclamation, Trump declared that the U.S. immigration and asylum system remains “in a crisis as a consequence of the mass migration of aliens across the border between the United States and Mexico.” He also raised the specter, again, of caravans of migrants approaching the border as part of the crisis. “The problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter our country unlawfully or without proper documentation has not materially improved, and indeed in several respects has worsened, since November 9, 2018,” Trump wrote. “An average of approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens continue to enter the United States each day at our southern border. And large, organized groups of aliens continue to travel through Mexico towards the United States with the reported intention to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation.” Watch: What is a national emergency? How Congress gave the White House broad, far-reaching powers Trump first issued an executive order on Nov. 9 that blocked migrants from requesting asylum if they entered the U.S. illegally between ports of entry. Under current law, U.S. authorities must consider asylum requests regardless of how an individual entered the U.S. Shortly after he issued the asylum ban, a California federal judge blocked the administration from carrying out the order after several civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against it. Then in December, the Supreme Court upheld the federal judge’s decision to block the Trump administration from implementing the new asylum restrictions. In the new proclamation, Trump said the government is appealing the injunction. “As President, I must act to protect the national interest, and to maintain an effectively functioning asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the many special benefits associated with being granted asylum,” Trump said. Advocacy groups have contended that the asylum ban infringes upon the civil rights of asylum seekers and that Trump cannot suspend federal rules on his own without an act of Congress. “The Trump administration has issued this extension of its draconian asylum ban, but the ban remains illegal and is still blocked by the courts,” Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. The Trump administration has long claimed that there is a “humanitarian crisis” at the southern border because of the high numbers of family units arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and has tried to redefine asylum rules and change other policies to deter migrants from coming to the border. Department of Homeland Security data show that although border apprehensions have been on a steady decline for nearly 20 years, the number of families trying to enter from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has increased under Trump and in the final two years of the Obama administration.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/171904-2---split---President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019, as Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., listen. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Just three days after calling for cross-party unity in Washington, President Donald Trump on Friday again lashed out at House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, suggesting his sweeping probe of all things Trump is merely a partisan hit job. The president used his Tuesday State of the Union address as a plea to Democrats to work with him and other Republicans to achieve legislative “greatness.” But just 16 hours later, he mockingly slammed the California Democrat after Schiff announced the panel would investigate Trump’s 2016 campaign, possible nefarious ties to Moscow and whether the former real estate mogul’s potential interest in financial gain has influenced his decisions as chief executive. Trump continued that attack Friday morning by alleging Schiff canoodled with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson during a recent security conference in Colorado, even though he is a witness in the Intelligence panel’s probe. “Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion, who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier, even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff,” Trump wrote in a tweet. The dossier, however, has never been fully corroborated nor fully discredited — Despite the president’s desire for, and political and legal interests in, the latter. At issue is a dossier of information about Trump and his alleged ties to Russians that was compiled for research firm Fusion GPS by former British spy Christopher Steele. The firm had been hired by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Simpson described the document as “a collection of field memoranda, of field interviews” in testimony before the senior staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee in August. Trump, White House aides and many Republican lawmakers continue to raise doubts about the dossier’s contents. Senate Judiciary member Lindsey Graham and others, for instance, have called on the Justice Department to name a second special counsel to investigate the actions of the Clinton campaign and Fusion GOP during the 2016 campaign. In a second social media post, Trump accurately stated that Schiff has indicated the Intelligence Committee’s initial probe — while it was overseen by Republicans before Democrats took over the House in January — found no Trump campaign-Russia “collusion.” But he left out that Schiff and panel Democrats have criticized the GOP-run probe and said it was too limited to actually answer the collusion matter, leading him to re-start it. Trump’s Friday morning tweets again showed how the president and his legal team want to turn the various investigations of the 2016 election, his businesses and presidency into a public relations battle. That’s largely because Senate Republicans have given no indication they would vote to remove him from office — and that vote would only come if House Democrats impeached him, which that party’s leaders remain reluctant to attempt. Trump again called the various probes a collective “GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX … used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election!” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---13.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/talks-on-border-wall-break-down-ahead-of-second-possible-government-shutdown---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Acting White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on the impact for the president's agenda. With less than a week to go until another potential partial federal government shutdown begins on Friday, bipartisan compromise talks on funding for President Trump's proposed border wall have completely broken down, sources tell Fox News. The sudden development again raised the possibility that Trump will declare a national emergency to access previously appropriated funds to initiate construction on a border wall. The White House agreed to a temporary spending bill late last month to end a historic 35-day government shutdown, although Trump said at the time that the move was not a "concession" and that he would not relent on his demands for a wall. "Talks have broken down because Senate Republicans are refusing to compromise on limits to the Trump administration’s cruel immigration policies," a senior Democratic aide told Fox News on Sunday. "A deal that includes new physical barriers must also include limits on the number of ICE detention beds. If Senate Republicans won’t compromise with us on both, we can’t reach a deal.” Added a GOP source: "The wall is a red herring for the Democrats. We got stuck on an interior enforcement cap." Such a cap would effectively limit ICE's ability to house illegal immigrants caught domestically by reducing the number of available beds in detention centers. The goal, Democrats say, is to force the Trump administration to prioritize arresting and deporting only violent criminals and dangerous offenders. Fox News is told if negotiators can’t resolve the situation soon, they are likely looking at trying to pass another temporary continuing resolution to try to avoid a shutdown. Two border wall projects totaling 14 miles will start this month Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who is leading negotiations on border wall funding, said Republicans don't want to offer concessions on ICE enforcement. “I think the talks are stalled right now. I’m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning, because time is ticking away, but we’ve got some problems with the Democrats dealing with ICE, that is detaining criminals that come into the U.S. and they want a cap on them," Shelby said. "We don’t want a cap on that." In response to the news, Trump suggested on Sunday that Democrats are hoping to force another shutdown.

Border Patrol officials say some Mexican homes and structures encroach on U.S. soil posing a dilemma for authorities when replacing the wall. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) "I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal," Trump wrote, referring to the bipartisan congressional committee working on a compromise. "They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!" Trump added: "It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!" As recently as last Friday, congressional negotiators said they expected a deal to be made, although some key players were pessimistic and Democrats indicated that money for physical barriers would likely end up well below the $5.7 billion that Trump has sought to begin construction of the wall. DEMS PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED FAR MORE EXPENSIVE SECURE FENCE ACT -- WHAT CHANGED? The amount discussed hovered much closer to $1.6 billion, participants in the negotiations said, a figure that was in a bipartisan Senate bill last year. "That's what we're working toward," said California Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard.

(Photo by Herika Martinez / AFP) (Photo credit should read HERIKA MARTINEZ/AFP/Getty Images) Speaking separately to "Fox News Sunday," Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that an emergency declaration might not be required. "There are other funds of money that are available to [Trump] through something called reprogramming, there is money he can get at and is legally allowed to spend," Mulvaney said, noting that some funds were available even without declaring an emergency. "And I think it needs to be said again and again this is going to be legal --- there are statutes on the book as to how any president can do this." Still, Mulvaney asserted that a national emergency was "absolutely on the table" and said that a wall will be built, one way or another. "The president is going to build the wall," Mulvaney said. "You saw what the Vice President said there, and that’s our attitude at this point ,is we will take as much money as you can give us and then we will go find money someplace else legally in order to secure that southern barrier. But this is going to get built with or without Congress." Earlier this weekend, Democrats seemed to draw a firm line on spending. Members of the bipartisan border security conference committee on the race to avoid another government shutdown. "Throughout the talks, Democrats have insisted that a border security compromise not be overly reliant on physical barriers," said Evan Hollander, spokesman for Democrats who control the House Appropriations Committee. "We will not agree to $2 billion in funding for barriers." The White House has previously offered a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion Trump has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. The offered deal would also extend protections for 300,000 recipients of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program -- which protects immigrants from designated countries with conditions that prevent nationals from returning safely. But Democrats have called the border wall nothing more than a political stunt that they will never agree to fund, while Republicans point to what they have called a "crisis" at the border. Central Americans are increasingly entering the United States illegally in groups of at least 100 people in rugged, remote stretches of the Mexican border, authorities said Friday upon releasing January figures that show total arrests fell for a second straight month. TRUMP TO PELOSI: IF WALLS ARE IMMORAL, WHY NOT TEAR DOWN EXISTING WALLS TOO? "The president is going to build the wall." A group of 325 Central Americans surrendered to agents Thursday near Lukeville, Ariz., according to Customs and Border Protection. Migrants told authorities that buses and trucks dropped them off throughout the night on a nearby Mexican highway that runs parallel to the border and they entered the U.S. together to wait for agents to find them. There were nearly 150 children, including 32 who were traveling alone. The Border Patrol has encountered groups of at least 100 people 60 times since Oct. 1, compared to 13 during the entire 2018 fiscal year and two in the 2017 fiscal year, officials said. Many are in the desolate New Mexico Bootheel and Arizona deserts.

The Trump administration said Thursday, Feb. 7, 2019, it would waive environmental reviews to replace up to 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) of border barrier in San Diego, shielding itself from potentially crippling delays. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) It is unclear what's driving the sudden uptick of large groups in remote areas, but families, many of them Central American asylum seekers, make up a large and growing percentage of arrests across the border. U.S. authorities arrested or stopped people for immigration violations 58,207 times in January, down 4 percent from 60,779 in December but up 62 percent from 35,905 in January 2018. It was the second straight monthly decline, though arrests typically fall from December to January. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Families and children traveling alone accounted for 33,861 of those encounters, or nearly 6 of every 10 stopped at official crossings or arrested for entering the country illegally between crossings, mostly from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. That's a dramatic change from several years ago, when most people who crossed illegally were single Mexican adults. The large percentage of families and young children has stretched U.S. authorities even more in remote areas where staffing is thinner. Customs and Border Protection says medical attention was needed about 12,000 times for border crossers in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30. On Jan. 14, a group of 376 Central Americans was arrested near San Luis, Ariz., the vast majority of them Guatemalan families who dug short, shallow holes under a barrier to cross the border, according to authorities.

---split---14.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/internet-week-207/---split---Hey, tiger. Long week, huh? Between the Jeff Bezos vs. National Enquirer dustup and the acting attorney general of the United States testifying before Congress, there's been a lot of back and forth. But last week also saw the premiere of Ariana Grande's new video and a cat that miraculously came back to life after being frozen in the snow, so it's not all bad. Happy Year of the Pig, everybody! What Happened: After all the shutdown drama, last week President Trump was finally able to give his 2019 State of the Union address. Was it worth waiting for? It depends on how much you were looking forward to bad writing and flat delivery, but at least the audience was interesting. What Really Happened: Welp, after a lot of political rigamarole, President Trump gave his State of the Union speech last week—and what a speech it was. Clocking in at 82 minutes, it was the third longest State of the Union speech ever. (Unable to break the record for the longest speech ever? Sad!) But journalists aside, nobody really cares about the runtime except for the poor people who had to sit through the whole thing. We'll get back to them later. In the meantime, let's look at what Trump said. https://twitter.com/PoliticalShort/status/1092968783734403072 https://twitter.com/StevenTDennis/status/1092972732793450496 https://twitter.com/katiecouric/status/1092977531979001863 https://twitter.com/RichardMadan/status/1092979119422431233 https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris/status/1092988815126552578 As should be expected, fact-checkers were busy pointing out falsehoods and misstatements, but even they couldn't make people take the speech as anything other than a damp squib, judging by the reaction online. https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1093472018345979905 OK, we meant those not already on the Trump train, as Twitter was all too eager to demonstrate. https://twitter.com/SupaSambo/status/1093225598695153664 https://twitter.com/RobertGuttman/status/1093184653731733504 https://twitter.com/RonaldKlain/status/1092986758143320066 https://twitter.com/MattGlassman312/status/1092981987504283649 https://twitter.com/jeremynewberger/status/1093150902092005384 Of course, we can't just blame the writing in this case. After all, it is a speech delivered by Donald Trump, and that brings certain … shall we call them perks? Sure, why not. https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1092975299212574728 It's also worth noting what the president didn't mention during the speech. https://twitter.com/NicoleGoodkind/status/1092992072607559680 But let's get back to that lengthy run time. Just how long was the speech this year? More importantly, how long did it feel? Well, let's consider the case of one of the special guests at the speech, brought there by the First Family. https://twitter.com/matt_odonnell/status/1092709486584872960 https://twitter.com/NYMag/status/1092634470484709377 It was a heartwarming story with a twist ending. https://twitter.com/AJHonore/status/1093143366995505152 So, yeah. It was a pretty bad speech. So bad that a lot of the post-speech discussion online didn't actually focus on Trump's oration, but on people the world was actually interested in. Of particular interest, as is becoming increasingly common these days, was the presence of representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Even among other congresspeople, she was a star. https://twitter.com/RepJudyChu/status/1092977182790569990 People were obsessed with what she was wearing (especially as she was one of many women of Congress dressed in white for symbolic reasons)— https://twitter.com/Arman_Azy/status/1092981594040688640 https://twitter.com/TUSK81/status/1092988761741246464 —and people were obsessed with how she behaved during the speech itself, with her responses drawing different reactions depending on what side of the political divide they came from. https://twitter.com/walkerj1/status/1092983408534401025 https://twitter.com/_BananaCandy/status/1092987450031407105 https://twitter.com/cosmos_michaelb/status/1093008013525364736 https://twitter.com/ElizabethBrossa/status/1093006455479984128 https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1092979322565083136 https://twitter.com/laurenacooley/status/1092977367805558795 The speech also launched a meme that put KKK hoods on AOC and the other Democratic women wearing white, but, as ever, Ocasio-Cortez rose above the cheap shots with a blunt, honest response. https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1093018708186972160 To be fair, she may have already won even before the State of the Union thanks to this preview tweet: https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1092793717533093888 Who would have thought that the Twitter President would run too long, and be brought low by someone else keeping to 280 characters or less? Is that … irony? The Takeaway: This feels like an appropriate summary of what happened during the State of the Union, sadly. More sadly, this could describe so many State of the Unions before this one. https://twitter.com/TalbertSwan/status/1093107277647757312 What Happened: Not content with winning people over by standing up to the president during the shutdown, last week speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi became the internet's avatar for State of the Union responses. What Really Happened: Officially, the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union speech came from Stacey Abrams, who delivered a short speech that seemed to go over well, triggering talk of a possible presidential run and panic at Fox News. But neither Abrams, nor even AOC, provided the most popular and widely shared Democratic rebuttal to the president's speech. No, for that, the internet turned to Nancy Pelosi. Madame Speaker? https://twitter.com/byHeatherLong/status/1092982016352681989 Sure, we all know what a "hell no" look is, but if only there was a perfect example of just how wonderfully passive aggressive Pelosi's clapping looked… https://twitter.com/bkurbs/status/1092999933865742337 Everyone immediately understood what was going on in the image, and so, a meme was born. https://twitter.com/spicykezzinnugg/status/1092986834949496833 https://twitter.com/MatthewACherry/status/1092992256036884480 https://twitter.com/desusnice/status/1092987689828265984 https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/1092985947229020160 https://twitter.com/eakuhl/status/1093085159946108928 The internet was in love. https://twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1092991025260318721 https://twitter.com/GhostFaceSigma/status/1092999695604072449 https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1093026631080386560 https://twitter.com/cbouzy/status/1093122054080118785 It was the clapback seen around the world, and was soon the subject of a number of news stories the next day. When sarcastic applause gets as much coverage as a speech, that’s when you know that nobody was really listening to what was being said. The Takeaway: There’s one person who recognized exactly what Pelosi was doing: her daughter. https://twitter.com/sfpelosi/status/1093178767642488832 What Happened: As if to reinforce that no one was paying attention to the State of the Union, lawmakers responded to Trump's demand not to be investigated by announcing a new wide-ranging investigation into his administration and campaign. What Really Happened: One particular line of Trump's SOTU speech would appear to be particularly prescient, given what happened the very next day—and not just because it was an awkward, tortured rhyme. https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/1092973137317322752 https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1092972612647559168 Less than 24 hours after the president complained publicly that there "cannot" be an investigation into his administration, the House Intelligence Committee—now under Democrat control for the first time in the Trump era—made a couple of big announcements. https://twitter.com/saraecook/status/1093161015284518912 No, that wasn't one of the big announcements, although the reason given seemed somewhat curious… Well, until the following two announcements were made, at least. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1093183795254185987 OK, that was kind of big. (Only kind of, because the Republican-controlled Intelligence Committee voted to release some of those transcripts last year, so it's not as if they were entirely hidden.) Even that was, however, the lesser of the two pieces of news announced by Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday. https://twitter.com/PaulaChertok/status/1093230084637437952 https://twitter.com/jeremyherb/status/1093197709908078593 https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1093187708892131330 Yes, the House will really for serious investigate the president and potential wrongdoing, unlike what happened under Republicans, which was clearly not intended to be a serious investigation. Oh, and that's not all: Everyone in America will get to find out exactly what the investigation reveals. https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/1093196039669145600 So, you know, that's kind of a big deal. How did the president, who just finished declaring he shouldn't be investigated, respond to the news that he was actually going to be very investigated? The answer is pretty much, "as you'd expect." https://twitter.com/EamonJavers/status/1093224108043784197 https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1093233021992480768 That was just the start of his tailspin; the next day on Twitter, he shared how he really felt. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093467800964866048 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093471134845190145 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093489029780332545 So, the tenor of his reaction seems to be "clearly terrified," then. The next few months clearly aren't going to be boring, at least. The Takeaway: How best to sum up this week in terms of the volleys between the president and the House Intelligence Committee? This seems pretty accurate, considering. https://twitter.com/fuzzyblumonster/status/1093209071564423168 What Happened: Apparently, every politician of a certain age in Virginia has a personal connection to blackface in their past. What Really Happened: It's not all about Washington this week, though! Let's take a moment to consider the horror show that is Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's response to the discovery of a photograph that may, perhaps, have featured him either dressed as a member of the KKK or in blackface. After initially apologizing hours after the photo went viral last Friday, he shockingly walked back that apology a day later. https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1091784017286963200 https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1091785141540843520 Oh, but it got worse. Much worse. https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/1091784469416169472 https://twitter.com/dandrezner/status/1091784421433401346 Yes, that's right; Northam's argument that it wasn't him in a photograph showing someone in blackface was, essentially, "Don't get me wrong, I did get dressed up in blackface, but I didn't look like that." And that's saying nothing about the fact that he almost moonwalked at the press conference, only to be talked out of it by his wife. Let's just say that it was far from the most convincing pushback. https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/1091791848648204289 https://twitter.com/lookner/status/1091789767962972164 This really didn't go down well with other Democrats. https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1091845562222153730 https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1091793639460745216 https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1091781709878751234 https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1091793476277202946 As of this writing, a full week after the photograph originally came to light, Northam has not resigned—indeed, he reportedly refuses to do so in case that meant he would be branded as "racist for life," as if that's not a done deal already—but the heat has been inexplicably taken off him by the fact that a second Democrat in Virginia came out as wearing blackface last week. https://twitter.com/MarkHerringVA/status/1093187229533519872 https://twitter.com/alexi/status/1093195453464748039 Unsurprisingly, the Republican Party swiftly moved to take advantage of this. https://twitter.com/VA_GOP/status/1093276851924021248 But, guess what? Spoiler alert: It's exactly what you're worried about. https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/1093537925290168320 Oh, and then there was this, too. https://twitter.com/nprpolitics/status/1093626726804901888 The Takeaway: What's genuinely shocking about the following tweet is that it doesn’t actually seem over-the-top or out-of-bounds considering what's actually been happening this week. https://twitter.com/rexsantus/status/1093613532560658440 What Happened: Actor Liam Neeson said some fairly racist-sounding things. Lots of people noticed. What Really Happened: In what might be an almost-impressive feat of career suicide, Liam Neeson decided to share something that he really shouldn't have last week. https://twitter.com/Independent/status/1092407864927371264 It almost sounds like an Onion joke, but it really wasn't; Neeson did indeed give an interview wherein he admitted to wandering around wanting to attack a person of color after a friend had been raped. https://twitter.com/treytylor/status/1092435266634244096 https://twitter.com/juliacraven/status/1092463209439731712 https://twitter.com/BizPears/status/1092424254514216960 https://twitter.com/HannahAlOthman/status/1092415672192327680 https://twitter.com/TooManyEmmas/status/1092437971796676608 The writer of the Independent story took to Twitter to talk about her experience. https://twitter.com/Clemence_Mcl/status/1092415369552236544 https://twitter.com/Clemence_Mcl/status/1092415593909796864 Some people tried to see the funny side of the what was happening— https://twitter.com/buttmerogers/status/1092551875973373952 https://twitter.com/Babre13/status/1092501850186702848 https://twitter.com/KindaSamwise/status/1092522247250722818 —but more people couldn't quite see what was worth laughing about. https://twitter.com/AyoCaesar/status/1092438089052708864 https://twitter.com/FredTJoseph/status/1092473358896246785 https://twitter.com/TheRickyDavila/status/1092505073337405442 https://twitter.com/heyjenbartel/status/1092575713062981632 The interview prompted much discussion across the media. A day later, Neeson attempted to tamp down the controversy, with a second interview on the topic. https://twitter.com/JamesAALongman/status/1092781007764369408 https://twitter.com/JamesAALongman/status/1092781800454344705 People weren't convinced by it, and the backlash continued as public events got cancelled. Would no one stand up for Neeson, preferably with a ridiculous statement that you can't quite believe was shared publicly? https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/1093598242426810368 There we go. Celebrities! They're just like us, only they say really stupid things and everyone hears about it! https://twitter.com/Ankaman616/status/1093557796325474306 The Takeaway: Man, remember when Liam Neeson wasn't an embarrassment? You know, like a week ago? https://twitter.com/levicantweet/status/1092505959879114759 Many fake news peddlers didn’t care if Trump won or lost the election. They only wanted to pocket money.

---split---15.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/people-watch-2019-congress-administration---split---Four key Hill players from both parties made Roll Call’s list of people to watch in 2019. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) The third year of Donald Trump’s presidency promises to be a time like no other in American history. Never before have both the legitimacy and the competency of the president been so vigorously challenged, and the questions will increase exponentially as House Democrats and the special counsel probe deeper. So it is no surprise that most of Roll Call’s People to Watch in 2019 revolve around the world of Trump. First up, are key players from Capitol Hill and the administration. By Kellie Mejdrich Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern, a liberal firebrand who’s spent years watching his amendments be rejected by Republican leaders, now has his fingerprints on virtually every major bill that reaches the House floor. McGovern, 59, is the new chairman of the Rules Committee, the last stop for big bills before they come to the floor and a powerful checkpoint. It’s here that amendments either get the green light to proceed or are deep-sixed. “I lived in the minority for a long, long time and the last two years were brutal,” McGovern says. “Virtually every amendment I offered was ignored. Not because they were not germane, they just didn’t want me to have them.” McGovern says he’s trying to change that dynamic in the 116th Congress. “If part of the deal is we’re trying to create a more functional Congress, then members need to feel that their voices matter,” he says. “And even members who I strongly disagree with.” But his power has limits. For example in January, when Republicans wanted a vote on President Donald Trump’s controversial border wall proposal as part of debate on a disaster aid bill, he had to nix it. McGovern says he would have allowed it, but legislating on appropriations is against House rules. Still, McGovern is likely to push for broader debate on issues he cares about. Asked how his chairmanship could affect debate on two major issues — anti-hunger programs and his push for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force to try to check the executive branch’s military actions abroad — he responds, “I think there will be many opportunities for us to weigh in on these issues.” His chairmanship is reassuring for Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, one of the most liberal members of the Democratic caucus. “You have somebody in charge of Rules that’s going to be fair and that’s going to prioritize that process around his sense of integrity and heart,” Grijalva says. McGovern’s years in the minority gave him perspective on stonewalling opposing views. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who’s long served on the panel with McGovern and is now its ranking Republican, says he’s hopeful the new leaders will be fair to GOP members. Of McGovern, Cole says, “I think he really is interested in empowering the Congress as an institution and individual members as representatives of their constituents.” McGovern acknowledges the influence of the House speaker on his panel — the speaker served as chairman of the committee from its establishment in 1789 through 1910, and the leadership of each party appoints the committee members. “There’s no doubt that the Rules Committee is the arm of the leadership,” McGovern says. But he doesn’t believe the committee should be an “automatic rubber stamp” for whatever comes out of the speaker’s office. “My guess is on the vast majority of things we’re in sync,” he says. “But if I have a different opinion, I’m not going hesitate to express it.” By Jonathan Miller You’d think someone who lost a high-profile Senate race in 2018 wouldn’t be much of a somebody to watch in 2019, but you’d be wrong. Very wrong. That’s because Republican Martha McSally of Arizona, who was appointed to her seat in December by Gov. Doug Ducey, has her work cut out for her before she faces voters again 21 months from now. In 2020, Democrats need to pick up four seats in the Senate to take back control, and Arizona, with its shifting demographics and voting, is a high-profile target. Already, McSally, 52, has been identified as one of the most vulnerable members in the Senate. In January, Major Forward — a super PAC affiliated with Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer —began running ads against her and a group of other endangered Republicans like Cory Gardner of Colorado, blaming them for the partial government shutdown. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales has rated her race a toss-up. And a growing number of Democrats, led by astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, are mulling a run against her. But if her early voting record and legislation is a sign, McSally is likely to stake out a path that sometimes veers from the rest of her party. In January, McSally, who has been assigned to five committees, including Armed Services, Banking and Energy and Natural Resources, joined a group of 11 Republican senators in voting to stop the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on companies controlled by a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. She’s also introduced three bills, all of which are co-sponsored by fellow Arizonan Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, that involve transfers and swaps of federally owned land — a long-standing issue that both have worked on for several years. That may sound like small potatoes, but it wasn’t that long ago that both were engaged in a heated Senate race that featured McSally, a former Air Force colonel and combat pilot, accusing Sinema of an explosive charge. It came at the end of a debate in October 2018, when McSally referenced a 2003 radio interview in which a host asked Sinema what she would think if he joined the Taliban. Sinema had responded, “Fine, I don’t care if you want to do that, go ahead.” McSally’s campaign seized on that comment, and during the debate, she accused Sinema of “treason.” McSally has positioned herself as a centrist — she was a member of the moderate Tuesday Group in the House, and was rated by the Lugar Center as the 69th-most bipartisan member of the House in 2017. While she was initially skeptical of President Donald Trump’s call for building a continuous wall along the southern border, she has since hardened her stance, calling for a “border wall, fully funded.” She is a strict anti-abortionist — in January, she voted for a failed Senate bill, commonly known as the Hyde Amendment, that coincided with the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and would permanently end all federal funding for abortion. In 2017-18, as a member of the House, she voted with Trump 98.5 percent of the time, above the average Republican score of 93.6, though her party unity score was somewhat below the average for her party, according to CQ Vote Studies. By Niels Lesniewski The new Congress has brought some familiar faces to new places within the inner leadership circle of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Key among them is Scott Raab, a long-time aide to the Kentucky Republican who has been promoted to policy director following the departure of Hazen Marshall. Raab fills a critical position as McConnell weighs what to do legislatively with his expanded GOP majority and how best to negotiate with a Democratic House. As became obvious with the protracted government shutdown and now a new round of border security negotiations, there’s a new dynamic to the job. Raab has big shoes to fill, but Marshall says he is well-suited to replace him. “Scott is deeply experienced in the health care arena, but has a keen political sense for other issues as well. And despite being ‘from’ Pennsylvania, Scott knows more about Kentucky than almost any native Kentuckian I’ve ever met!” Marshall said. That might be exceptionally important with his boss up for re-election in Kentucky in 2020. Marshall returned to Capitol Hill when McConnell became majority leader after the 2014 elections. He previously worked as Senate Budget Committee staff director and then as a lobbyist. Raab first came to work for McConnell well before that, back in 1999, becoming the legislative director in McConnell’s personal office before joining McConnell’s leadership staff in 2010. Antonia Ferrier, another recently departed senior McConnell aide, stressed that Raab is not a D.C. show horse, often shunning credit. “He knows the Senators, he knows the staff, he knows Kentucky and he knows Senator McConnell. He really is the trifecta of hard-work, know-how and smarts that have made him the indispensable team player,” Ferrier said. More recently as policy adviser, Raab had responsibility for the health care and telecom portfolios; with the new role he expands his reach to other issues. Raab’s health care portfolio included advising the Senate Republican Conference during the original debate over what became the 2010 health care overhaul law (PL 111-148, 111-152). That came in handy when McConnell and the majority Republicans pushed to roll back portions of the measure President Barack Obama signed into law. “I have relied on Scott’s sound counsel and policy expertise for two decades to deliver victories for Kentucky and our nation,” McConnell said in a statement announcing Raab’s promotion and Marshall’s departure. Raab’s successor in his previous policy adviser role is another former McConnell legislative director. Jen Kuskowski has returned to the McConnell world from the Senate Finance Committee, where she was until recently the majority’s health policy director. Kate Ackley contributed to this report. By John M. Donnelly Paul Arcangeli, the majority staff director of the House Armed Services Committee, passed away nearly 20 years ago, he said in a recent interview. “I died in the middle of the night while I was sleeping,” he remembered. Arcangeli, then 33, had sudden cardiac arrest that night. Doctors revived his heart on his bedroom floor. Although he went into a coma, he made it through. He has survived four more such incidents since then. Prior to that first heart incident in 1999, Arcangeli had thought that if he were to meet his demise early, it would not occur in bed. That’s because his work at the time was extraordinarily dangerous: he was an expert in explosive ordnance disposal for the Army. Looking at Arcangeli today, one would never guess his heart problem. The Alabama native is an avid runner and has a vibrant personality. Suffice it to say, Arcangeli does not take a single day for granted. And he is approaching with zeal his new position as the top staffer on the panel that oversees the biggest chunk of the federal discretionary budget in the form of the annual defense authorization bill, or NDAA. Arcangeli joined the House Armed Services staff in 2004, starting at the Subcommittee on Readiness. He ascended quickly to be the Democrats’ deputy staff director, and the committee’s then-chairman, Missouri Democrat Ike Skelton, tapped Arcangeli in 2010 to be majority staff director. Arcangeli only worked in the committee’s top staff job for that one year. The GOP once again took charge of the House starting in 2011, and Arcangeli worked as minority staff director from then until this year. When it comes to national security, Washington has begun 2019 with a bang. President Donald Trump deployed active-duty troops to the southern border to help stem what he contends is a flood of dangerous immigrants. Trump has talked about declaring a national emergency so he can circumvent Congress and possibly use Pentagon funds to build a security barrier across that border. Trump also peremptorily announced the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Syria, and he is weighing doing the same for perhaps half the American forces in Afghanistan — or maybe all of them, if a peace deal being negotiated with the Taliban takes effect. Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the new House Armed Services chairman and Arcangeli’s boss, has pushed back forcefully against Trump on all these moves. Smith has been joined in this resistance on some issues by Texas Republican Mac Thornberry, the committee’s former chairman and now ranking member, though the two are bound to disagree on plenty going forward. Arcangeli says Smith’s top priorities fall into four categories. The first is improving military preparedness, meaning ensuring everything from trained personnel to capable equipment. The second is cost effectively modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a potentially $1 trillion undertaking. Third is making sure the military is inclusive of all the types of people who want to serve and can do so effectively. And the last is continuing to push for more efficiency in Pentagon purchasing. Last year, Congress cleared the NDAA with weeks to spare before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1 — the quickest work it had made of the bill in more than four decades. It will not be nearly so easy this year, Arcangeli says. Unlike last year, lawmakers have yet to decide on new caps for spending on both defense and nondefense programs. It is not an agenda for the faint of heart. So Arcangeli is perfectly suited for it. By Paul M. Krawzak When GOP efforts to repeal the 2010 health care law went up in smoke in September 2017, President Donald Trump pivoted to see what changes he could make to the health care system through the regulatory process. It turned out Trump could do a lot. Brian Blase, 38, special assistant to the president for economic policy, has been at the center of efforts to shape what administration officials view as a more rational health care system with greater access to care and lower costs. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University (his dissertation was on Medicaid), and he is the longest serving member of the National Economic Council, which he joined in January 2017. Blase sees potential for the new Congress and the president to find common ground on reducing drug prices and targeting waste and abuse. Another goal is to help states take advantage of more flexible guidance allowing them to seek waivers from the 2010 health care overhaul (PL 111-148, PL 111-152). The opioid epidemic will remain a priority of the administration, Blase says. He adds that it also will continue to push the Medicare payment system in what is called a “site-neutral” direction, reducing disparities in the payments that hospitals and other providers receive for the same services. Health care experts have argued that higher hospital rates have helped drive consolidation, leading to less competition and higher costs. His work up to now includes the drafting of Trump’s October 2017 executive order to promote health care choice and competition, as well as new rules to expand the use of employer-funded, tax-advantaged health care accounts, and increase access to short-term health care plans and cheaper association plans, which allow businesses to band together to offer insurance at lower rates. The executive order required the administration to produce a comprehensive plan for overhauling the health care system. Blase says the 120-page plan, issued in December, aims to tackle two key health care problems that contribute to unnecessary cost and inefficiencies: the amount of financing through third-party payers, which he says creates a disconnect between patients and providers, and “anti-competitive” policies, which the administration believes prevent innovation. “I really get angry at how the system and government policy are constructed to benefit powerful institutions and special interest groups, and really present enormous complexity and cost for the average person,” Blase says. “I think what hospitals, insurance companies and Pharma get away with — often with government help — is pretty outrageous.” Blase in part blames the reimbursement rates under Medicare, which he says create shortages of services when rates are set too low, and unnecessary cost and overutilization when rates are too high. For example, he says, Medicare does not pay well for geriatricians, “so we have very few geriatricians in the country who would take a more holistic view of senior citizens’ health care needs.” Blase calls his job “extremely exciting” because it gives him the chance to improve the health care system and lower its costs. “That’s what I want to do for my career,” says Blase. “That’s what I’m passionate about.” By Kate Ackley Shahira Knight, who currently serves as the White House’s chief liaison to Capitol Hill, got her start as an aide to then-Rep. Bill Thomas, a California Republican who chaired the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. In a Washingtonian magazine poll, Hill aides voted Thomas the “meanest” lawmaker, and his temper was the stuff of congressional legend. “I liked him a lot, but he was tough as nails, and she was able to — professionally and without ruffling feathers — she was able to do the job for him,” says former Hill aide and lobbyist Jade West of Thomas and Knight’s rapport. Not only did Knight learn how to navigate a sometimes brutal working environment as staff director at Ways and Means, but she also became a top expert in tax policy and cultivated a reputation for being an honest broker. “Her policy chops are unchallenged,” says West, who is senior vice president of government relations at the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. “She has earned the unqualified trust of everybody I know who has worked with her. Adding on top of that, she is incredibly responsive under the most trying of circumstances.” Case in point: Though Knight, 46, was at the center of discussions to end the partial government shutdown, West says the White House aide nevertheless responded to an email about an unrelated policy matter one day in January, and late in the evening. Knight’s current position wasn’t exactly what she expected to be doing this year. She joined the White House as deputy director of the National Economic Council, working behind the scenes on the 2017 tax overhaul (PL 115-97). She was all set to return to the private sector as a top lobbyist for the Bank Policy Institute, a newly formed financial services industry organization. But when her predecessor, Marc Short, announced his departure as White House liaison to the Hill, the Trump team persuaded her to take the job. At the banking lobby, Knight was to lead government affairs, communications and member engagement, according to a news release issued about the move she later canceled. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said in the statement that Knight “exemplifies the top talent financial services companies are investing in to advocate policies to help drive the U.S. economy forward.” Before joining the Trump administration, Knight was a lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, which paid her $741,445 in 2017 for vested shares, according to Knight’s 2018 financial disclosure form. K Street talent scouts say that unlike some high-profile administration staffers whose association with controversial policies may hurt their long-term job prospects in the private sector, Knight’s value is likely only to grow given her position, policy expertise and her relative anonymity outside the Beltway. “She’s got everything you’re looking for in a senior-level government affairs executive,” says lobbying headhunter Ivan Adler. “Shahira has a deep background substance-wise in taxes, and that adds her to her value.” Knight declined comment for this profile, according to a White House press aide, who cited the partial government shutdown as the reason. However, she did speak with the Atlantic during the shutdown. When the magazine asked her if she was happy with how her team was handling the shutdown, “she let out a sigh,” the Atlantic reported, and then quoted her as adding later, “You know, I do think the team has handled it well.” John T. Bennett contributed to this report. By Jim Saksa In some ways, Mark Calabria is a conventional pick to run the Federal Housing Finance Administration, the overseer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He’s chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence and has had stints at the Cato Institute, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Association of Realtors and Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Who better, then, to supervise two government-sponsored entities that securitized and guaranteed about 46 percent of all U.S. mortgage originations in 2017? Well, Calabria is also the guy who wrote this: “Securitization is a false god that failed us.” Calabria accused the government-sponsored enterprises (known as GSEs) of idolatry in a 2016 essay that called for returning the U.S. mortgage finance system to the originate-and-hold model, where lenders made loans and intended to keep them through maturity —a practice that prevailed before the savings and loan crisis erupted in the late 1980s. Securitization, in which Fannie and Freddie bought mortgages from lenders and repackaged them as federally guaranteed securities sold to institutional investors, grew from the mass grave of a thousand bankrupt thrifts as a way to move the risk of borrowers’ defaulting on 30-year mortgages off the original lender’s balance sheet. But Calabria, pointing to the 2007 housing crash, thinks it made things worse by spreading, hiding and ultimately amplifying risk. In his ideal world, Congress would end Fannie and Freddie’s conservatorship and revoke their government charters, turning them into completely private companies. Acting Director Joseph Otting recently told FHFA employees that the administration wouldn’t wait for Congress to wind down government control of the GSEs, saying Calabria and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both signed off on the idea of taking unilateral executive action to end the Fannie/Freddie conservatorship. Since his nomination, Calabria hasn’t publicly said whether he would merely urge Congress to rehab Fannie and Freddie with some light regulatory remodeling or go it alone on a tear-down-and-rebuild project. But many who know him think Calabria will be circumspect. “We should all want to [end conservatorship,]” says Sen. Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican for whom Calabria worked for six years as a senior Banking Committee staffer. “There are a lot of things he can do over there without an act of Congress, but to reform the whole of Fannie and Freddie? He can’t do that alone.” The U.S. housing market ended 2018 on a downswing, with sales dropping and prices flatlining. National Association of Realtors chief economist Laurence Yun, who expects a stable 2019, says the market is fragile — one significant policy shock could shatter it. “Looking at the housing sector, and how important it is to the economy, [Calabria] knows that if there is a downfall in housing, he could easily trigger a recession,” says Yun. “I think he’ll be very cautious as to how he’ll want to dial back [Fannie and Freddie.]” Calabria could look at making fewer homes eligible for GSE-backed mortgages, thereby forcing borrowers to look for alternatives. “He’ll put a fair amount of thought in how to shrink Fannie and Freddie’s footprint in the least disruptive manner,” says Jim Parrott, a senior adviser at the National Economic Council in the Obama White House. The trick, Parrott says, would be doing so in a way that leads to more private-label mortgage securities — not an increase in Federal Housing Administration loans or a decrease in home sales. Ed DeMarco, Housing Policy Council president and a former acting FHFA director, says Calabria might start by directing Fannie and Freddie to share more mortgage data, positioning the private sector to step up as the GSEs pull back. He could follow that by putting Fannie and Freddie on a diet — reversing recent increases to the conforming loan limits and the debt-to-income limits, which, respectively, made more expensive homes and lower-credit borrowers eligible for GSE-backed mortgages. As presidential aspirants vie for working class votes, Calabria may decide to take the populist route, Parrott says. Fannie and Freddie could stop buying mortgages used in cash-out refinancing, where homeowners free up money for things like renovations by replacing their existing mortgages, or pull out of the secondary home and investment property markets, he says. No matter what he plans for the housing market, Calabria can expect an intense interrogation during his Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing from Democrats hoping to call the White House home after 2020.

---split---28.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/president-is-still-a-one-trick-pony---split---President Donald Trump’s address on Tuesday wasn’t the opening salvo of his 2020 campaign. It was the beginning of the end, Shapiro writes. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) OPINION — Donald Trump’s next State of the Union Address will be delivered in the shadow of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. It will be a time when the spirited race for Democratic nomination will offer more drama than the president’s tricks and tweets. And if the Democrats win back the White House, that 2020 speech will have been Trump’s last State of the Union, since defrocked presidents, even ego-mad ones, rarely make the inaugural year trek to Capitol Hill to read their own political obituaries. Trump’s Tuesday night bloviation-a-thon (which almost broke Bill Clinton’s don’t-stop-talking-until-tomorrow State of the Union record) has been described as the opening salvo of his 2020 re-election campaign. But what it really represented was Trump’s weakened position as he contemplates a second four-year term in a White House that he probably wishes had more gold faucets. For all the heavy-handed leaks from presidential aides that the speech would be an uplifting appeal for “unity,” Trump demonstrated yet again that he is unable, even with a teleprompter, to sustain a conciliatory tone for more than 20 minutes. All it took to spoil the mood was Trump’s denunciation of “ridiculous partisan investigations” and his ridiculous claim, “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.” To use a 19th-century circus term, Trump is a one-trick pony. No matter how fervently Republicans wish that Trump in his eighth decade would miraculously grow in office, he will always remain the bilious billionaire of the 2016 campaign. Judging from Tuesday night’s speech, Trump seems poised to borrow his campaign slogan from 1950s British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan, who boasted that the voters “never had it so good.” In Trump’s telling, he is the mastermind behind the greatest economy since the Egyptian pharaohs went on a pyramid-building spree. While some of Trump’s braggadocio about the economy was as hyperbolic as his real estate brochures, there was an element of truth to his pointing with pride. As Trump put it, “Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.” In truth, the lowest annual unemployment rate (3.5 percent) since the Korean War was achieved in 1969, the first year of Richard Nixon’s presidency. Even though more than 11,000 American soldiers died in Vietnam that year, Nixon’s approval rate still bounced between 55 and 65 percent. The months before the 9/11 attacks were another a period of near-record low unemployment — and both Clinton and George W. Bush were rewarded with approval ratings above 60 percent. Presidential popularity has always been closely linked with the health of the economy. But in contrast to Nixon, Clinton and Bush, Trump’s approval rating is roughly where it has always been — bumping along just a shade above 40 percent. Why does anyone believe that things can get better politically for Trump by the 2020 election? If prosperity and the perception of peace cannot close the deal with three-fifths of the electorate, what else will Trump have going for him? According to the Gallup Poll, a strong public consensus against Trump’s Great Wall of Politics has remained roughly unchanged from June 2018 until the end of January. While there is no reliable polling yet on the State of the Union (overnight surveys are cable TV clickbait), nonstop Trump demonology about caravans approaching the Rio Grande, terrorists sneaking across unfortified border crossings and immigrant gangs running wild in the streets have failed to move the needle. It should be remembered that Senate Republicans are increasingly reluctant to come to Trump’s rescue. With GOP Senate seats potentially in jeopardy in 2020 in Colorado, Arizona, Maine and (if Stacey Abrams runs) Georgia, political self-interest argues for imperiled legislators to step back from an uncritical embrace of an unpopular president. Mitch McConnell — the human weathervane — recently told the White House that he can’t provide a Senate majority if Trump declares a bogus national emergency at the border. And McConnell is also talking about passing compromise legislation to avoid another government shutdown, even if there is no guarantee that Trump would sign it. With an empowered, iron-fist Nancy Pelosi ruling the House and skittish Republicans clinging to a Senate majority, Trump will soon discover that, in legislative terms, he is already a lame-duck president. Devoid of the power to persuade and lacking the ability to credibly project fear, Trump’s arsenal will be limited to the veto. Then there is Robert Mueller and the other federal investigations of all things Trump. While only soothsayers with the unerring vision of Rudy Giuliani dare predict the pace and the outcome of the Mueller investigation, Trump is unlikely to ever benefit from a national wave of sympathy over his tragic victimization by a “witch hunt.” It is an article of faith among Republicans that “Democrats in Disarray” will become a major headline leading into the 2020 campaign. But with the sudden exception of Virginia, it is impossible to find credible evidence that the Democrats have embarked on a mutual suicide mission. Although in different fashion than he intended in the State of the Union, Trump has given the Democrats that most precious political gift — unity. A recent Monmouth University national poll found that Democrats, by a hefty margin, prefer a presidential nominee who could beat Trump over one who checked all the right boxes on ideological issues. When Trump reviews the history of what will probably be his single term in the White House, he may look back on State of the Union night 2019 and say, with a tinge of sadness, “I never again had it so good.” Walter Shapiro has covered the last 10 presidential campaigns.
