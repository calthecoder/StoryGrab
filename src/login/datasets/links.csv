Trump is in this for no one other than himself (and maybe his family, I guess). He plays to his base and riles progressives to maintain chaos. He proposes destructive policies with an eye toward lining his pockets. He's not here to "own the libs" specifically, but doing so is useful sleight of hand. It keeps his voting base focused on the vague idea of an enemy at home, rather than the politicians who continue to grift their way around Washington's as-yet-undrained swamp. And now we have this umbrella. A useful tool in the moment as Trump holds it over his head to shield himself from the rain. Then, once he gets to the moment of boarding Air Force One, he drops the umbrella without any care or thought. It's just an umbrella, his defenders will no doubt scream. And they're right, it is. But the lack of regard shown in this one instance says so much about the man who was carrying that umbrella. Sometimes things go viral because they're cute, or horrifying, or incredible, or in some other way highly noteworthy. And sometimes they just resonate with the moment. On a day when the nation and the world were focused on the horrors unfolding in Pittsburgh, Trump's stupid umbrella moment resonated. WATCH: Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No. It's an inflatable Trump baby flying around London Oct 29, 2018 Youre not one to embellish the truth, especially because others respect your sincerity when you reveal the unvarnished facts.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcumv.com/talent/lester-holt/bios_read_more---split---Lester Holt is an award-winning journalist and anchor of "NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt," the network's flagship broadcast currently celebrating its 70th anniversary. Holt also leads NBC News’ special reports, breaking news and primetime political coverage. Holt was named to the role of “NBC Nightly News” anchor in June 2015 after eight years as anchor of "NBC Nightly News" weekend editions and 12 years as co-anchor of "Weekend TODAY." In addition, Holt has served as principal anchor of "Dateline NBC" since September 2011. Holt joined NBC News in 2000 and is known for his outstanding work in the field, reporting and anchoring from breaking news events across the globe. He traveled to PyeongChang in February where he led NBC News’ coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, anchoring “Nightly News” from South Korea and reporting on the stories behind the world’s greatest athletes in what was his ninth Olympic Games. It was Holt’s second trip of 2018 to the Korean Peninsula, where just weeks before the Olympics he reported on the growing tensions between the United States and North Korea from inside the totalitarian state. Over the past several years, he has reported from Manchester, Brussels and Paris on the terrorist attacks that took place across Europe. Previously, Holt anchored from South Africa during the Nelson Mandela memorial service; reported from the streets of Cairo on the latest political and civil unrest in Egypt during the Arab Spring; covered the earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan; and reported on the immediate aftermath and response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti. His field reporting often focuses on people most directly affected by the biggest stories of the day. In the week leading up to the presidential inauguration in January 2017, he traveled across the U.S. talking with Americans about the nation’s most pressing issues and their hopes for the next four years. Holt also hosted a roundtable of South Carolina voters before the 2016 primary, spoke with Baltimore residents following city-wide protests in April 2015, and had an exclusive talk with the witness who recorded the Walter Scott shooting. Holt is deeply committed to providing viewers on-the-ground, first-person accounts when disaster strikes. He traveled to Houston and Southern Florida in the fall of 2017 to get live, first-hand perspectives of the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. He also reported from Las Vegas this past October in the aftermath of the Mandalay Bay shooting, and from Sutherland Springs, Texas after the massacre in a church there took the lives of 26 people. As a preeminent broadcast journalist, Holt was selected to moderate the first presidential debate of 2016, which was the most-watched debate in American history. Holt’s one-on-one with President Trump in May 2017 stands as the most consequential interview of the Trump presidency, after Trump told Holt the firing of former FBI head James Comey was tied to the Russia investigation. In January 2017, he traveled with President Obama on the Commander in Chief’s final trip aboard Air Force One, for an in-depth interview in Chicago. Earlier in the 2016 presidential race, Holt received praise for his work moderating the first Democratic debate of the year. He has also sat down for revealing, news-making interviews with candidates Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. NBC News was the most watched news organization of Election 2016, with Holt anchoring all of the network’s primetime coverage through the Republican and Democratic conventions, debates and Election Night. Before becoming co-anchor of "Weekend TODAY” in 2003, Holt anchored "Lester Holt Live," a daily news show on MSNBC. Holt served as a primary anchor for MSNBC's coverage of major news events, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and the war in Afghanistan, and he was the lead daytime anchor for MSNBC's coverage of Decision 2000. Holt also served as anchor of "Countdown: Iraq," a nightly news telecast concentrating on the latest developments surrounding the war with Iraq, from October 2002 through March 2003. For “Dateline NBC,” Holt has anchored numerous specials and investigative reports, such as “Breathless,” a story of injustice that examined the connection between childhood asthma and poverty in America. Holt also reported on wrongful convictions involving Richard Rosario and Johnny Hincapie, two cases that made national headlines. Additionally, he reported three hours on the aftermath of the Great Recession as part of the “American Now” documentary series. Holt came to MSNBC from after 14 years at WBBM-TV in Chicago. Previously, Holt worked as a reporter at WCBS-TV in New York City and sister station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles as a reporter and weekend anchor. His work has been recognized with numerous honors, including multiple Emmy Awards and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism award. In June 2017, Holt was honored with Quinnipiac University’s Fred Friendly First Amendment Award. In April 2016, Holt received several notable designations: he was featured on TIME’s 100 Most Influential People list, The Hollywood Reporter’s Most Powerful People in New York list and was named “Journalist of the Year” by the National Association of Black Journalists. He was named to Variety’s New York Power List in September 2016. Holt studied government at California State University in Sacramento. He resides in New York City with his wife.

---split---2.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/im-barely-breathing-synagogue-survivor-recounts-terror-58820409---split---A survivor of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre described Sunday how he and other terrorized worshippers concealed themselves in a supply closet as the gunman stepped over the body of a man he had just shot and killed, entered their darkened hiding spot and looked around. "I can't say anything, and I'm barely breathing," recalled Barry Werber, 76, in an interview with The Associated Press. "He didn't see us, thank God." The gunman, Robert Gregory Bowers, opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons during worship services inside Tree of Life Synagogue, killing eight men and three women before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, according to state and federal affidavits made public on Sunday. He expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and later told police that "all these Jews need to die," authorities said. Six people were injured in the attack, including four officers. Bowers targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of the city's Jewish community. As authorities worked to piece together Bowers' background and movements, harrowing accounts from the survivors began to emerge. Speaking at a vigil in Pittsburgh on Sunday night, Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said about a dozen people had gathered in the synagogue's main sanctuary when Bowers walked in and began shooting. He said seven of his congregants were killed. "My holy place has been defiled," he said. Officials released the names of all 11 of the dead, all of them middle-aged or elderly. The victims included intellectually disabled brothers and a husband and wife. The youngest was 54, and the oldest was 97. "The loss is incalculable," said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. Mayor Bill Peduto called it the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." Bowers shot his victims with an AR-15 — the weapon used in many of the nation's mass shootings — and three handguns, all of which he owned legally and had a license to carry, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation, and who spoke on Sunday on condition of anonymity. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady in Pittsburgh said Sunday night that federal prosecutors intend to pursue the death penalty against Bowers. Bowers was a long-haul trucker who worked for himself, Brady said. Little else was known about the suspect, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. It appears Bowers acted alone, authorities said. The victims included Melvin Wax, a retired accountant in his late 80s who was always one of the first to arrive at synagogue and among the last to leave. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other," said Myron Snider, a fellow member of New Light Congregation. "Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." The toll also included professors, dentists and physicians. Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his younger brother David Rosenthal, 54, were intellectually disabled and lived together in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, near the synagogue where they were killed. "Cecil's laugh was infectious. David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable," said Chris Schopf, vice president of residential supports for ACHIEVA, which helped the brothers live independently. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Bowers apparently posted an anti-Semitic message on a social media account linked to him just a few minutes before he opened fire during Sabbath services on Saturday morning. After the attack, he told an officer, "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit . In the basement, four members of New Light Congregation were just starting to pray — with two others in the kitchen — when they heard crashing sounds coming from upstairs, looked out the door and saw a body on the staircase, Werber, the survivor, recalled Sunday in an interview at his home. He said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman closed the door and pushed them into a large supply closet. As gunshots echoed upstairs, Werber called 911 but was afraid to say anything, for fear of making any noise. When the shots subsided, he said, Melvin Wax opened the door, only to be shot and fall back inside. "There were three shots, and he falls back into the room where we were," he said. "The gunman walks in." Apparently unable to see Werber and the other congregants in the darkness, Bowers walked back out. A day later, Werber called the gunman "a maniac" and "a person who has no control of his baser instincts." "I don't know why he thinks the Jews are responsible for all the ills in the world, but he's not the first and he won't be the last. Unfortunately, that's our burden to bear," Werber said. "It breaks my heart." The massacre came at a time of increasing anti-Semitism in the U.S. Earlier this year, the Anti-Defamation League reported a nearly 60 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 — the largest single-year increase since the ADL began its tracking nearly three decades ago. Perlman, who also spoke at the vigil Sunday night, said New Light lost three congregants. "These three men, they cannot be replaced," said Perlman, his voice breaking. "But we will not be broken. We will not be ruined." Bowers was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in what the leader of the Anti-Defamation League called the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. He was also charged in a 29-count federal criminal complaint that included counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death — a federal hate crime — and using a firearm to commit murder. Bowers, who underwent surgery and remained hospitalized, is scheduled to appear in court Monday. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf. A message left with the federal public defender's office in Pittsburgh wasn't immediately returned. Of the six survivors, four remained in the hospital Sunday night, and two — including a 40-year-old officer — were listed in critical condition. The nation's latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh in St. Peter's Square. "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence," he said. He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." ——— Lauer reported from Philadelphia, and Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

For the women and girls of Pakistan, “honor” can be deadly. They may be killed for something as simple as a glance at the wrong man, or as life-changing as trying to determine their own future. AP tells their stories. Americans are more divided than ever, gridlocked over social issues, race, gender and the economy. In this series, The Associated Press explores what divides us and how deep those divisions run. In the two years since the Islamic State began building its self-styled “caliphate,” it has killed thousands of people, displaced millions, forced the abandonment of entire villages, and taken over key cities in Syria and Iraq. Here, the AP chronicles the casualties of the IS war. Thailand is the world's third-largest seafood exporter. It's supply chain has been notoriously murky and is staffed largely by poor workers from neighboring regions. Many are tricked or coerced by brokers who sell them onto fishing boats. Sometimes they are even drugged and kidnapped. That's what four AP reporters found during an 18-month investigation into human trafficking and forced labor in Southeast Asia's seafood industry. The investigation started with a simple question: Could the catch from men enslaved on Thai fishing boats at sea be tracked to U.S. households? Forty years after the fall of Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City), Peter Arnett has written a new memoir, “Saigon Has Fallen.” Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the Vietnam War for The Associated Press and later gained fame as a correspondent for CNN. In this vivid recounting, Arnett describes his experience of reporting a war that divided Americans and altered the lives of those who covered it.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Firing of Amber Renee Guyger, who is charged with manslaughter in the deadly shooting of Botham Jean in Jean's own apartment, is premature, according to her lawyer. The family of the man who was fatally shot in his own apartment by a Dallas police officer in September filed a federal lawsuit on Friday. Botham Jean, a 26-year-old black man, was killed at home by Amber Guyger, a white police officer, after she claimed to have mistaken his apartment for her own and took him for an intruder. She was later charged with manslaughter and fired from the force. Both Guyger and the city of Dallas were named in Friday’s suit, which claimed that Guyger used excessive force when she shot Jean. The lawsuit also contends the department did not adequately train Guyger. The police department, the suit alleges, trains its officers to use deadly force even when no “immediate threat to themselves or others" exists. An affidavit prepared by a Texas ranger said Guyger went to the wrong apartment after ending her shift on Sept. 6. The door was ajar, according to the document, and Guyger opened it to find a figure in the dark apartment. She drew her firearm moments later and shot two times, hitting Jean once in the torso, according to the affidavit. Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys for Jean's family, has cast doubt on the narrative. Merritt has said that two independent witnesses told him they heard knocking on the door in the hallway before the shooting. He said one witness reported hearing a woman's voice saying: "Let me in! Let me in!" The Associated Press contributed to this report. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

A brave dad armed with a pistol stopped what could have been a mass shooting Saturday inside an Alabama McDonald's when he took down a masked gunman who had stormed in and opened fire. The unidentified father was leaving the establishment with his sons when a masked man walked into the Birmingham fast-food restaurant and started shooting, WBRC-TV reported. The father returned fire and, during the ensuing shootout, the gunman, the father and one of the man's teenage sons were struck, according to the station. The gunman, who was not identified, later died of his injuries. The other two injuries were not considered life-threatening. Markus Washington, one of the McDonald's employees, told WBRC-TV he was making two quarter-pounders when bullets started to fly. Washington said he ran into the freezer, where he heard about 15 shots fired. “I’m feeling grateful,” he told the station. “Wrapping my head around it all, I was just wishing someone would come wake me up from this nightmare.” Washington, oblivious to the shootout taking place outside the freezer door, feared the worst. “All we hear is like different gunfire, so in my mind, I’m imagining everybody is dead. He’s looking for us,” he said. Washington added he was thankful the armed customer was there. "Wrapping my head around it all, I was just wishing someone would come wake me up from this nightmare." “He’s my hero. Because I can only imagine how it would’ve went if he wasn’t armed. We might not be here having this interview,” Washington said. The father is not expected to face charges, police said. Authorities are now working to determine if the gunman intended to rob the restaurant, was targeting an employee or planned something more nefarious. “Things like this are difficult for both families. The gentleman who unfortunately lost his life, the teenage boy who is in the hospital recovering from his injuries and the father who is also recovering from his injuries,” Birmingham police spokesman Sgt. Bryan Shelton said, according to WVTM-13. “It's not easy being a father and watching your child get injured, get hurt like that. It's a really heartwrenching experience."

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. New details have surfaced from the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting police released scanner audio from the tragic event; Jacqui Heinrich reports. The suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue repeatedly expressed anti-Semitic views as he traded gunfire with responding officers, at one point flatly stating: "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit made public Sunday. Robert G. Bowers, 46, was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in connection with the attack that killed 11 people and injured six others -- including four police officers. Bowers was also charged with 29 federal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and using a firearm to commit murder. He is expected to appear before a federal judge Monday afternoon for formal arraignment. Bowers' alleged assault on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood began at approximately 9:50 a.m., when all three congregations housed in the building were holding Sabbath services. According to the federal affidavit, Bowers was armed with three Glock .357 handguns and an AR-15 rifle. The Associated Press, citing a law enforcement official, reported that Bowers owned the guns legally and had a license to carry them. The state affidavit showed that multiple calls reporting an active shooter were made from the synagogue at 9:54 a.m. The first two officers to arrive on the scene exchanged fire with Bowers, who shot one of the officers in the hand. The other officer received facial lacerations from shrapnel and broken glass. After this initial confrontation, the affidavit said Bowers "retreated further into the [synagogue]." Neither affidavit specified whether any victims were shot after this point or whether the victims had been killed and injured before the initial police response. Stephen Cohen, the co-president of New Light Congregation -- which rents space at Tree of Life and lost three of its members in the rampage -- told the AP that Rabbi Jonathan Perlman shepherded some of the congregants behind a steel door in the basement of the building, likely saving their lives. THE VICTIMS OF THE SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE According to the state affidavit, a Pittsburgh SWAT team entered the building to look for Bowers and recovered a wounded man and woman. The pair were evacuated from the building and taken to a local hospital, where they are listed in stable condition. By that point, the affidavit stated, Bowers had made his way to the third floor of the synagogue. After SWAT team members found him there, the document said Bowers shot two team members multiple times leaving one officer in critical condition. The remaining team members exchanged fire with Bowers, eventually wounding him and capturing him. During this period, according to the federal affidavit, Bowers "repeated comments regarding genocide, his desire to kill Jewish people, and that Jewish people needed to die." He also accused Jews of "committing genocide to my people," a comment that echoes those Bowers is believed to have made on the social media site Gab. OPINION: I PRAYED AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE In a post made Saturday morning, a man with Bowers' name directed his ire toward the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a nonprofit organization that provides aid to refugees. Bowers said: "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered." Late Sunday, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said he was seeking approval to pursue the death penalty against Bowers. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A Pittsburgh Steelers logo with one of the hypocycloids changed to a Star of David, on a banner at Heinz Field for Sunday's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Pittsburgh's professional sports franchises honored the victims of Saturday's deadly mass shooting at a synagogue with a moment of silence and plans for a blood drive and donation collection. The Steelers observed a moment of silence before Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns at Heinz Field, which is approximately seven miles west of the Tree of Life Synagogue, where a gunman killed eight men and three women during services. In a tribute to the victims, a tweak to the Steelers' distinctive logo changed a yellow shape into a Star of David and added the words "Stronger than hate." The image appeared on social media Saturday and at least one child in the stands wore that logo as a patch on his jersey. In a statement issued before Sunday's game, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." The Pittsburgh Penguins announced the team would host a blood drive on Monday and collect donations from fans attending Tuesday's home game against the New York Islanders. A moment of silence will be held before the game and the team announced that the previously planned Halloween theme for the game would be canceled. "The Pittsburgh Penguins join the greater Pittsburgh community in standing up against this senseless violence and supporting the victims and families of the Tree of Life Synagogue,” said David Morehouse, president and CEO of the team. “Under these circumstances, we determined it was not appropriate to continue with our annual Halloween theme on Tuesday, so those activities have been cancelled. The entire city has a heavy heart." The club also announced that the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation would donate $25,000 to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh and another $25,000 to establish a benefit fund with the city's Department of Public Safety for the four Pittsburgh police officers injured in Saturday's shooting. A moment of silence also was held before the Penguins' road game against the Vancouver Canucks Saturday evening, which Pittsburgh won 5-0. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Developing now, Monday, Oct. 29, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - THE 'FORGETTABLE' SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE SUSPECT: The man accused of storming a Pittsburgh synagogue and killing 11 worshippers during an anti-Semitic rampage was described by neighbors as a loner who listened to talk radio, chain-smoked and was so bland in person that he bordered on being “forgettable" ... “I really wish there was some type of clue,” Chris Hall, who lives next door to accused killer Robert Bowers, told Fox News. Hall said Bowers “felt more comfortable expressing his views online rather than in person. If I were to wave to him and he said, ‘All Jews must die’ or there was an SS sticker on his car, I would have f---ing reported him... but he didn’t do any of those things.” Bowers allegedly opened fire with an AR-15 rifle during worship services inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday, killing eight men and three women before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. Six other people were injured in the attack, including four police officers. Among the dead were a grandfather, a husband and wife and two brothers. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97. Bowers faces 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in addition to federal counts that include weapons offenses and hate crime charges. Prosecutors say they intend to seek the death penalty. SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA: An Indonesian jet carrying 189 passengers and crew crashed into the sea Monday shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, prompting a major rescue effort in the region, Indonesia's disaster agency reported ... An agency spokesman posted photos of the debris including a crushed smartphone, books, bags, and parts of the aircraft fuselage that had been collected by search and rescue vessels. Indonesia's Lion Air said the Boeing 737-800 had lost contact with air traffic control about 10 minutes after its departure from Jakarta for Pangkal Pinang. Data for Lion Air's Flight 610 on aircraft tracking website FlightAware ends just a few minutes following takeoff. A telegram from the National Search and Rescue Agency to the air force had requested assistance with the search of a location at sea off Java. Lion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest and biggest airlines, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations. ICYMI: STEYER VS. TRUMP: President Trump derided rival billionaire Tom Steyer as a "wacky" and "crazed & stumbling lunatic" on Sunday, after Steyer -- who was one of the prominent liberals to receive a threatening suspicious package last week -- said he "absolutely was blaming" Trump for creating an atmosphere in which "anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up" ... Steyer fired back quickly, writing that Trump's comment was "unthinkable ... in the midst of the horrible political violence." The Twitter spat erupted after Steyer's wide-ranging interview with CNN's "State of the Union," in which the hedge fund manager called Trump "corrupt," and accused him of "the most abject dereliction of duty in the history of the country" by "willingly putting Americans in harm's way" because he has dismissed a major United Nations report on global climate change. Steyer not only appeared to implicate the president's rhetoric in the suspected explosive devices allegedly mailed by Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc to top liberal figures, including Steyer, but also in the deadly mass shooting by gunman Robert Gregory Bowers at a synagogue on Saturday. Bowers regularly posted anti-Trump and anti-Semitic comments on social media. A TALE OF TWO CARAVANS: More than a hundred Central American migrants reportedly tried to force their way through a customs gate at the Guatemalan border town of Tecun Uman to request passage into Mexico ... One migrant was reportedly killed. A Mexican official said Sunday that the group is seeking entry via Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico. Video from the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre showed men arguing with Mexican immigration officials through the metal bars of a gate separating the two countries. Meanwhile, a larger caravan of Central American migrants attempting to reach the U.S. border took a rest break on Sunday, stopping in Tapanatepec, Mexico. The news came as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced that the military has already begun delivering countermeasures to the southern border. The Pentagon has sent jersey barriers in conjunction with plans to deploy active-duty troops there, and full details of the number of troops to be deployed as well as their roles should be announced Sunday night, he told reporters. During an appearance on "FOX News Sunday," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vowed that the caravan "is not getting in." FINAL STRETCH TO THE MIDTERMS: With Election Day eight days away, the final countdown to the pivotal midterms are in full-effect and Democrats and Republicans are fighting for momentum in key gubernatorial races and in the battle for control of Congress ... Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke is touting his new endorsements from three leading Texas newspapers in his insurgent bid to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, while the GOP makes apparent gains in several wild gubernatorial and Senate races. In Missouri, the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling average now shows Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley leading vulnerable incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill by 1 point, based on a new poll released Saturday by the Missouri Scout showing Hawley up by 4 points. Fox News currently considers the race a toss-up. The Senate continues to be favorable turf for Republicans, according to Fox News polling and the RCP average, as the GOP benefits from a favorable map this year: Democrats are forced to defend 26 seats, including 10 in states that Trump carried. (Only a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for election every two years.)A CBS poll released Sunday showed Republican Mike Braun ahead of incumbent Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly by 3 points -- within the margin of error, but still a worrying sign for Donnelly as the GOP builds momentum and tries to flip his seat. Meanwhile, on the heels of a rally hosted by Trump last week, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has pulled to within striking distance of Democrat Tony Evers, with Cook Political Report now declaring the race a toss-up that might turn on Walker's superior political organization. Fox News rates the contest as lean Democrat, and RCP's polling average gives Evers a 3.6 point edge, down from 6.3 in August. High-profile Democrats have also poured into the state in recent days, as Walker continues to cut into Evers' lead. And in Florida, where polls have consistently shown Democrat Andrew Gillum leading Republican Ron DeSantis in the gubernatorial race by a slim margin, early voting numbers show Republican voters are turning out in greater numbers than Democrats, suggesting an enthusiasm gap. JUBILATION IN BEAN TOWN: The Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 on Sunday night to win the World Series ... The Red Sox proved why they were the best team in baseball all season, defeating the Dodgers in just five games to clinch their ninth championship in franchise history. The Red Sox won their first two games at home, before dropping third game in Los Angeles and closing out the series in Game 4. “It’s a dream come true,” Red Sox center fielder Mookie Betts said after the game. POLITICAL 'OUTSIDER' ELECTED PRESIDENT IN BRAZIL: Brazil’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal declared Sunday that far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a champion of traditional Brazilian values, has won the country's election for the presidency of Latin America’s biggest country and the world’s fourth-largest democracy ... Bolsonaro, who cast himself as a political outsider despite a 27-year career in Congress, is the latest of several leaders around the globe to gain prominence by mixing tough, often violent talk with right-wing positions. But he also is very much a product of a political tempest in Brazil that made his messages less marginalized: widespread anger at the political class amid years of corruption, an economy that has struggled to recover after a punishing recession and a surge in violence. The name of his party, PSL, translates to "Social Liberal Party," although it largely abandoned its socially liberal platforms after he joined. Bolstering his rebel image is his reputation for offensive statements and sometimes extreme views, including insulting women, black people and the LGBT community.

He also abandoned an umbrella as he climbed aboard Air Force One. In a clip that quickly went viral, Trump is seen walking up the stairs leading to his presidential jet, umbrella in hand. As he reaches the door, Trump's hand drops lower and lower until the umbrella is scraping the floor. Seconds later, he ditches it entirely and disappears into the plane.

Trump is in this for no one other than himself (and maybe his family, I guess). He plays to his base and riles progressives to maintain chaos. He proposes destructive policies with an eye toward lining his pockets. He's not here to "own the libs" specifically, but doing so is useful sleight of hand. It keeps his voting base focused on the vague idea of an enemy at home, rather than the politicians who continue to grift their way around Washington's as-yet-undrained swamp. And now we have this umbrella. A useful tool in the moment as Trump holds it over his head to shield himself from the rain. Then, once he gets to the moment of boarding Air Force One, he drops the umbrella without any care or thought. It's just an umbrella, his defenders will no doubt scream. And they're right, it is. But the lack of regard shown in this one instance says so much about the man who was carrying that umbrella. Sometimes things go viral because they're cute, or horrifying, or incredible, or in some other way highly noteworthy. And sometimes they just resonate with the moment. On a day when the nation and the world were focused on the horrors unfolding in Pittsburgh, Trump's stupid umbrella moment resonated. WATCH: Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pittsburgh-donald-trump-jewish-group_us_5bd66a3de4b0d38b5884ee66---split---The leaders of a progressive Jewish organization in Pittsburgh said President Donald Trump should not visit the city as it mourns the 11 people murdered in a mass shooting at a synagogue until he changes his tone. “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,” the leaders of the local chapter of Bend the Arc wrote, adding: “For the past three years, your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement. You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.” The group said Trump’s rhetoric had not only led to attacks on Jewish people, but also “deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.” The organization also demanded that Trump “stop targeting and endangering all minorities,” “cease your assault on immigrants and refugees” and “commit yourself to compassionate, democratic policies that recognize the dignity of all of us.” During the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday, alleged gunman Robert Bowers, 46, reportedly screamed “all Jews must die” before he opened fire. Prosecutors have filed 29 charges against Bower, 22 of which could lead to the death penalty. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/memorial-pittsburgh-synagogue-massacre_us_5bd650bee4b0a8f17ef91c03---split---PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - Some 2,500 people gathered on Sunday at a memorial service for the 11 Jewish worshipers slain in their Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath prayers, a mass murder the mayor called the city’s “darkest hour” while exhorting mourners to “defeat hate with love.” Several speakers addressing an overflow crowd at the University of Pittsburgh’s Soldiers and Sailors Hall sounded themes of inclusion and unity, in counterpoint to the rise of toxic political discourse widely seen as creating an atmosphere conducive to violence. “What happened yesterday will not break us. It will not ruin us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together and continue our historic legacy in the city with the friendliest people that I know,” Rabbi Jonathan Perlman told the interfaith audience. Three members of his congregation were among those killed when a man armed with an assault rifle and three handguns on Saturday stormed the Tree of Life temple in the city’s heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood yelling “All Jews must die” as he opened fire on worshipers. In addition to the 11 mostly elderly victims who were killed, six people, including four police officers, were wounded before the suspect was arrested. Two of the surviving victims remained hospitalized in critical condition. The massacre marked the deadliest attack ever on America’s Jewish community, according to the Anti-Defamation League and Jewish Council for Public Affairs. Robert Bowers, 46, who has a history of posting anti-Semitic messages online, has been charged under federal hate crime statutes, and could face the death penalty if convicted. “This is the darkest hour in our city’s history,” Mayor Bill Peduto declared during Sunday’s service. “But here’s another thing about Pittsburgh. We are resilient. We will work together as one. We will defeat hate with love. We will be a city of compassion and we will be welcoming to all people,” he said to cheers. The auditorium of the Soldiers and Sailors Hall, a venue that seats more than 2,300, was filled to capacity with hundreds more people gathered outside the building. The names of the dead were released hours earlier. They included David Rosenthal, 54; his brother Cecil Rosenthal, 59; Sylvan Simon, 86, and his wife Bernice Simon, 84; Joyce Fienberg, 75; Richard Gottfried, 65; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Daniel Stein, 71; Melvin Wax, 88; and Irving Younger, 69. The eldest victim was Rose Mallinger, 97. She was among five of the slain who lived in Squirrel Hill, a quiet, leafy district with a large Jewish population. The community also was home to the late Fred Rogers, whose long-running children’s television show “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” featured lessons on friendship and kindness. The remaining victims were from other parts of Pittsburgh, the second-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia. The mass shooting sparked security alerts at houses of worship around the country and condemnation from politicians and religious leaders. Some complained that the confrontational, nationalistic rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged right-wing extremists and fed a surge in activity by hate groups. Trump, who quickly branded Saturday’s shooting an act of pure evil and called on Americans to rise above hatred, was already facing similar criticism ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections following a spate of pipe bombs mailed last week to some of his most prominent critics. The targets, mostly Democrats, included former U.S. President Barack Obama. “Honestly I think this president’s whole modus operandi is to divide us. He gets up in the morning with new and inventive ways to divide us,” U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is Jewish, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” broadcast on Sunday. Trump told reporters the killings might have been prevented if there had been an armed guard. Synagogue officials said police would only normally have been present for security on high holidays. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said on Fox News Sunday that federal officials visited the Pittsburgh synagogue in March to provide training on active-shooter responses. The mayor said on Sunday that keeping guns out of the hands of irrational people was a better way to prevent violence. FBI Special Agent Robert Jones told a news conference he did not know why Bowers had targeted the Tree of Life synagogue. Authorities believe the suspect entered the synagogue, opened fire on worshipers and was fleeing when he encountered a police officer, Jones said. The two exchanged gunfire, he said, and Bowers reentered the building before a police tactical squad arrived. Bowers surrendered and was taken to a hospital where he was listed in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds. Federal prosecutors charged Bowers late on Saturday with 29 criminal counts including violating U.S. civil rights laws. Bowers’ virulent anti-Semitic views were evident in prolific online postings. In one, early on Saturday, he wrote that a Jewish refugee group, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” He is due to make his first court appearance on Monday afternoon before a federal judge in Pittsburgh.

The victims' names were released Sunday morning by the Allegheny County medical examiner's office, one day after authorities say Robert Bowers opened fire during a weekly service at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney for Pittsburgh, said federal prosecutors were seeking approval from the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty, The Associated Press reported Sunday night. Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54, both of Squirrel Hill, were brothers, said Dr. Karl Williams, the chief medical examiner. Sylvan Simon, 86, and his wife, Bernice Simon, 84, both of Wilkinsburg, were killed Saturday morning at same synagogue where they had wed in a candlelight ceremony in December 1956, according to Pittsburgh's Tribune-Review newspaper. The youngest victim was David Rosenthal. The oldest was Rose Mallinger, 97. The other victims were: Williams said at a news conference that the victims' families has all been notified and were "are in shock" and "grieving." Friends and loved ones remembered those who were killed as kind, devoted to spiritual life at the synagogue and loving toward one another. Michael Stepaniak, who knew the Simons for decades, told the Tribune-Review that the pair were "a loving couple, and they've been together forever. I hope they didn't suffer much, and I miss them terribly." Myron Snider, a friend of Wax, a retired accountant, described his friend to The Associated Press as "such a kind, kind person." He said Wax was a pillar of the congregation, according to the AP. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," Snider said. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person." Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, told the AP that "the loss is incalculable." Stein and Gottfried made up "the religious heart" of the congregation and would help the rabbi with everything that needed to be done to hold services, Cohen said. Zachary Weiss, whose father was filling in for the rabbi at the Tree of Life congregation, told NBC News on Saturday that his father told him that when the shooting began, it initially sounded like a "car crash." But soon it became clear that they were dealing with an active shooter, Weiss said. "My father was able to make sure that everybody was hidden, whether it's in the back or they were hidden in place," he said, adding that his father went downstairs to check on another congregation. At one point, his father saw shell casings moving, but he didn't get a clear look at the gunman, Weiss said. Weiss said he hoped people would remember the victims, as well the first responders. He called for the city to come together amid the tragedy. "I'm literally seething, and my heart breaks for so many people," Weiss said. Carnegie Mellon University said Fienberg was the widow of a longtime university and "herself a valued member of our community for almost 40 years."

---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-shows-anti-semitism-in-america-must-not-be-ignored---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Authorities confirm 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue and six people injured, including four police officers; Jackie Heinrich reports. Reportedly shouting “all Jews must die,” a gunman killed 11 people and wounded six others, including four police officers, as a tragic and gruesome crime scene unfolded Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue. FBI special agent Bob Jones, who’s been with the FBI for 22 years, called the scene of the anti-Semitic attacks at the Tree of Life Synagogue “the most horrific crime scene I have seen.” Robert Bowers, 46, was arrested at the shooting scene after he was wounded and was charged Saturday night with 29 criminal counts. The attack illustrates the prevalence of anti-Semitism in our country. Speaking to farmers in Indianapolis, President Trump called for unity following the shooting and labeled the attack "pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable.” He denounced anti-Semitism unequivocally saying that “there must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America.” At a campaign rally in Illinois, the president addressed the attack and said that "the evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us.” He also said it has to be "confronted and condemned everywhere it rears it very ugly head.” Violence in all forms needs to be confronted and condemned. The problem is that for far too long, anti-Semitism has neither been confronted nor condemned. Instead it’s been ignored. If nothing else, hopefully this harrowing, monstrous act against an innocent Jewish community opens our eyes as a nation to the reality that anti-Semitism is alive and well in America. We can no longer plead ignorance to its existence. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) promotes itself as an advocacy organization that monitors hate groups and extremists. Except the group is more concerned with hate directed at Muslims than at Jews. When it came to monitoring the extremism and hate that perpetrated more than 1,700 acts of anti-Semitism at American colleges and universities from 2015 to 2017 – crickets from the SPLC. Likewise, there were crickets from Democrats when Louis Farrakhan made his latest pronouncement of anti-Semitism just last week, comparing Jews to termites. Facebook took down video of Farrakhan saying: “So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, call me anti-Semite. Stop it. I’m anti-Termite,” Twitter allowed the anti-Semitic comment to stand and continued giving it a platform. Violence in all forms needs to be confronted and condemned. The problem is that for far too long, anti-Semitism has neither been confronted nor condemned. Instead it’s been ignored. If that’s not bad enough no one in the Democratic Party, nor many of our leading media personalities, felt it necessary to condemn Farrakhan’s hate speech. The Democrats haven’t historically been lining up to stand in solidarity with Israel either. In 2015 when then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak before Congress, 56 Democrats staged a boycott of his speech. Among those turning their backs on the leader of one our closest allies were then-future Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; then-future Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.; likely future presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, and others. It’s one thing to note someone’s controversial words and rhetoric, but boycotting Netanyahu’s address to Congress was an action. Actions, as we all know, speak louder than words; words resonate, but actions resonate even more deeply. These are leaders of the Democratic Party, and they have a track record of not supporting Israel. America, we have a problem. First lady Melania Trump tweeted: “My heart breaks over the news out of Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America.” Yes, we do need to unite – all races, religions and political persuasions. We all must come together and denounce all hate and violence, toward all groups of people. That includes Jews and that includes the Jewish state of Israel. Hate has no place in our country. It’s time we all condemn all of it, without prejudice, unequivocally in all forms. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

---split---2.0---split---https://mlb.nbcsports.com/team/american-league-west/---split---Last night, President Trump tweeted his thoughts on Dodgers manager Dave Roberts’ bullpen strategy. Starter Rich Hill had tossed six shutout innings, but issued a leadoff walk to Xander Bogaerts in the seventh. After striking out Eduardo Núñez, Roberts elected to swap Hill for fellow lefty Scott Alexander, who walked Brock Holt on four pitches. He then brought in Ryan Madson, who has struggled in the World Series thus far. Madson was able to get Jackie Bradley, Jr. to pop out, but then served up a three-run home run to Mitch Moreland that put the Red Sox back in the game. The Red Sox would to on to tie the game in the eighth, then hung a five-spot in the ninth en route to a 9-6 victory. Trump tweeted: Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! During the postgame press conference, Roberts was asked to respond to the tweet. To his credit, Roberts was level-headed about the criticism. Roberts said, “The President said that? I’m happy he was tuning in and watching the game. I don’t know how many Dodger games he’s watched. I don’t think he was privy to the conversation. That’s one man’s opinion.” Roberts wasn’t the only one to respond to Trump’s tweet. Via Bill Shaikin of the Los Angeles Times, Hill said, “There was a mass shooting yesterday … The focus, in my opinion, of the president is to be on the country, and not on moves that are made in a World Series game.” Astros third baseman Alex Bregman tweeted a few crying laughter emojis followed by, “I’m crying …. don’t get mad at me for commenting y’all… this is a sports related tweet….” Then, responding to someone who suggested that Trump’s tweet isn’t out of character for a President, Bregman said, “I’m just saying it’s funny how we are told to stick to playing sports… It’s very hypocritical when he’s telling Roberts how to manage…especially when a mass shooting just happened earlier that day…” Follow @Baer_Bill
---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-the-left-does-not-understand-about-hunters---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. (istock) Forests are now awash with an impressionist’s pastels across much of the Northern US. Soon the color will drip as fallen leaves to the forest floor and it’ll seem like the Robert Frost poem “October,” (O hushed October morning mild; Thy leaves have ripened to the fall…) is being whispered by the wind. To hunters this is the call of the wild. Bird hunters see the colored forests and dream of walking into upland cover behind their spaniels and retrievers. Deer hunters feel the cool air and smell the fallen leaves and know it is time. Waterfowl hunters see ice edging creeks and ponds and know cold air in the north will send the ducks and geese south. Hunters don’t see this with cold calculation, but with a love of the outdoors and the game they hunt and consume. Yes, love. Those who don’t hunt can have trouble understanding this. The contradictions seem too obvious. How can you kill what you love? Partly this misunderstanding is hunters’ fault. Though we’re seduced by the natural splendor and lobby for wildlife conservation and pay taxes that fund much of the conservation in the US, we’re careful how much we talk about this. Articulating Aldo Leopold’s brand of environmental ethics openly and with our hearts on our sleeves just isn’t manly. We can’t tell people, even other hunters, we love the game we hunt. They would think us effeminate, soft-headed or something. And that’s part of our weakness. Still, I’ve seen hunters tear up when their sons or daughters tag their first pheasant or deer. I’ve seen similar emotion shown by hunters in hunting camps, at state game department meetings, at meat processors and taxidermists. I once saw the toughest guy I ever knew kneeling down, balling like a child when he found one of his hounds dead on a road. I live along a rural-urban cultural divide in New York State and so see people misunderstanding each other on this topic whenever it comes up in mixed company. I have neighbors who moved north from Brooklyn who are frightened of hunters. They called the police when they first moved upstate. A neighbor who lives a half-mile away likes shooting clay birds, built his own sporting clays course on his property. My neighbors thought there was a shootout going on. The cop who responded told them, “Oh, that’s just Bill. Welcome to the country.” They were shocked when they learned I hunt. I shop at the same farm stands they do. I understand and respect their perspective. In my view, they simply have a few things to learn about what is really good for the environment in the forest around their home. I showed them the browse line – where the deer have eaten away the understory of the forest – on the acres they own and explained how important it is for the sake of biodiversity to control the deer population. They’ve been polite and neighborly, but we still talk past each other on environmental topics. When I told them I have hunted all over the lower 48 and in many Canadian provinces, and that, wherever I travel, I always find that hunters love what they hunt, they looked baffled. I told them when they see a pickup truck parked in autumn along a rural road, realize that a man or a woman (more women are now hunting than ever before) is out there trying to earn their own meat and this isn’t a bad thing. If the hunter is following game laws – as the vast majority do – then they are being used as a tool by wildlife biologists to control deer and other game populations and to pay as they go. I’ve told them hunters pay Pittman-Robertson taxes when they buy guns and ammunition and that last year about $800 million was raised from these taxes and sent to the states for conservation programs. Another $350 million was raised in 2017 from similar taxes on fishing equipment. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for firearms manufacturers, estimates that, on a daily basis, about $3.5 million is contributed through taxes on guns and ammo and hunting license fees to wildlife conservation. The meat hunters bring home is eaten. Go to any local meat processor on or after opening day of deer season to see all the hunters coming in to drop off their deer and to tell the butcher how they want the meat cut up for their table. The wild meat is also “green,” as it is free-range, hormone-free and hasn’t been genetically messed with by man. I’ve told my neighbors that each year I toy with restricting myself to only eating meat I actually kill, as I almost do that anyway. I don’t because, like most, I enjoy variety; still, we must respect where our sustenance comes from and securing meat with your own hands and wits does engender deep respect. As I said, from these experiences comes love. When we chat about such things I see in them an ignorance made possible by the mainstream media’s treatment of the millions of Americans who hunt. The media has mocked President Donald J. Trump’s sons for being hunters and has even treated them, and other hunters, as if they are bloodthirsty killers. It is a tragedy that the environmental community, and thus the progressive left, won’t treat hunters as the conservationists they are. They don’t because they view hunters as a political constituency that more often votes for Republicans. Hunting, after all, is a practical sport, real experiences in an increasingly virtual world, and reality has a way of creating conservatives.

---split---2.0---split---https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2018/10/28/players-respond-to-president-trumps-tweet-criticizing-dave-roberts/---split---Last night, President Trump tweeted his thoughts on Dodgers manager Dave Roberts’ bullpen strategy. Starter Rich Hill had tossed six shutout innings, but issued a leadoff walk to Xander Bogaerts in the seventh. After striking out Eduardo Núñez, Roberts elected to swap Hill for fellow lefty Scott Alexander, who walked Brock Holt on four pitches. He then brought in Ryan Madson, who has struggled in the World Series thus far. Madson was able to get Jackie Bradley, Jr. to pop out, but then served up a three-run home run to Mitch Moreland that put the Red Sox back in the game. The Red Sox would to on to tie the game in the eighth, then hung a five-spot in the ninth en route to a 9-6 victory. Trump tweeted: Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake! During the postgame press conference, Roberts was asked to respond to the tweet. To his credit, Roberts was level-headed about the criticism. Roberts said, “The President said that? I’m happy he was tuning in and watching the game. I don’t know how many Dodger games he’s watched. I don’t think he was privy to the conversation. That’s one man’s opinion.” Roberts wasn’t the only one to respond to Trump’s tweet. Via Bill Shaikin of the Los Angeles Times, Hill said, “There was a mass shooting yesterday … The focus, in my opinion, of the president is to be on the country, and not on moves that are made in a World Series game.” Astros third baseman Alex Bregman tweeted a few crying laughter emojis followed by, “I’m crying …. don’t get mad at me for commenting y’all… this is a sports related tweet….” Then, responding to someone who suggested that Trump’s tweet isn’t out of character for a President, Bregman said, “I’m just saying it’s funny how we are told to stick to playing sports… It’s very hypocritical when he’s telling Roberts how to manage…especially when a mass shooting just happened earlier that day…” Follow @Baer_Bill LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hard to believe now, all these wins later, but the Alex Cora Era in Boston began with a loss. A brutal one, in fact. Opening day at Tropicana Field in late March, none of his late moves worked out as the bullpen blew a big lead in a 6-4 setback. No fan in New England would admit it now — still, chances are some had already started to wonder whether he was the right guy for the Red Sox. “It’s baseball,” Cora reassured that afternoon. “We know it’s going to happen. … I guess get it out of the way right away.” Yep, guess so. A calming presence in a boiling sports cauldron, Cora capped off one of the greatest runs by a first-year skipper in leading Boston to the World Series championship. His Cora-nation came Sunday night, when the Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 in Game 5. The victory set off celebrations all over. While throngs of Red Sox fans chanted “Cor-a! Cor-a!” from the seats and so many more reveled across the country, all of Puerto Rico certainly cheered its native son from Caguas. Cora became the first manager from the island to guide a team to a championship. It came more than a year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico — when Cora negotiated his contract last October, he asked the Red Sox to help his people with relief efforts, and the team eagerly pitched in. Moments after hoisting the championship trophy, Cora made one more request. “Next thing I’m going to ask ownership is if we can take the trophy to my island,” he said. “That would be great.” Cora again turned Dodger Stadium into his personal party room. A year ago, he celebrated at the park as Houston’s bench coach after the Astros beat Los Angeles in Game 7. This time, he was front and center when Boston hoisted the shiny gold trophy. Cora became the fifth manager to win the crown in his first season, joining Bob Brenly (Arizona, 2001), Ralph Houk (Yankees, 1961), Eddie Dyer (Cardinals, 1946) and Bucky Harris (Washington Senators, 1924). Called A.C. by his players, Cora has an unassuming presence. He often wears a gray hoodie in the dugout and doesn’t raise his voice — except to yell at umpires. Shouting at his own team? “No, no, I don’t,” he said before Game 5. “I talk to them and I try to stay in tune with them. If I have something to tell them, I just sit with them. Very casual. Very casual.” “I try to do it that way. It feels right. It feels right,” he said. “I never had a manager that was like rah, rah, screaming at guys. They always had good conversations, and I learned from them and that’s what I’m trying to do.” His dugout demeanor is boosted by a combination of analytical aptitude and people approach. “Coralytics” is what it’s called by his agent, Scott Boras. Cora was hired after John Farrell, who led the Red Sox to the 2013 title, was fired following two straight early exits in the AL playoffs. “Alex was the manager that fit for us. He was really good in so many ways,” Red Sox President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski said before Game 5. “He knew Boston. I think he excels in dealing with the media, which in Boston is a bigger job than some other places. It can be cumbersome for a lot of people, and I’m not saying it’s not for him at times, but it’s part of the process and he handles it easily.” Cora was chosen over about a half-dozen candidates that included former managers Brad Ausmus and Ron Gardenhire. “It was a clear-cut choice that he was our guy,” Dombrowski said. After the opening loss, Boston won 17 of its next 18 games and was on its way. Cora steered the Red Sox to a team-record 108 wins in the regular season, then Boston topped the 100-win Yankees and Astros in the playoffs. Along the way, it seemed Cora could do no wrong. Brock Holt it for the first postseason cycle when Cora gave him his only start of the Division Series against New York. Cora masterfully managed a bullpen that many questioned before October, then avoided burning it out by leaning on hard-throwing starter Nathan Eovaldi in key spots. And Cora helped coax a breakout postseason from World Series Game 5 winner David Price. “A.C. told us from the first day in spring training we could do it,” AL MVP favorite Mookie Betts said. “We believed in ourselves, we believed in him and we went out and executed.” The clinching win at Houston came on the day Cora turned 43, and his players sang happy birthday to him in the clubhouse. “More than anything, he’s just brought consistency,” ace Chris Sale recently said. “He’s the same guy in the first inning as he is in the ninth inning of a 10-1 ballgame or 3-3 ballgame. I think that’s the overall thing as players that we take from him. “Ninth inning, bases loaded, one out of a one-run ballgame, and he’s sitting there eating seeds, doing the same thing as a 10-1 ballgame in the fourth inning. And I think that goes very well with us as players, when if he’s not panicking, why should we?” Sale said. Cora grew up playing ball with his older brother, Joey, a former big league infielder. Alex spent 14 years in the majors, batting .243 as an infielder with six teams. He got to the plate one time in Boston’s sweep of the 2007 World Series, putting down a sacrifice bunt for a team led by David Ortiz, Dustin Pedroia and Manny Ramirez. “Offensively, we did a lot of good things. And then the bench, it was amazing, they had the best utility guy in the bigs in 2007,” Cora said with a playful grin Sunday. “That guy was great.” With the season over, Cora can enjoy spending more time with his twin 15-month-old boys. Free from any criticism that comes with such a high-pressure job, too, although he doesn’t stress over it. “I really don’t care if they second-guess me. I prepare. We prepare as a group, and you make decisions,” he said after Game 1. “And honestly when I’m done here, I shower, I get in that car, I might get a text and say, “Go to the pharmacy and get some diapers for the kids.” ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tree-of-life-synagogue-shooting_us_5bd49519e4b0a8f17ef843e0---split---President Donald Trump on Saturday stated that the mass shooting at a Pennsylvania synagogue had “little to do” with gun control laws, suggesting the “results would have been far better” if there had been “protection inside.” “This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside ... they would have been able to stop them,” Trump told reporters before departing for the Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis. “Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him, frankly,” he added, referring to the shooter. A gunman shot three police officers when he opened fire at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as Saturday services began around 9:45 a.m. Eastern time and killed 11 people, injuring six others. Congregants at the synagogue, located in the historically Jewish Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, had been observing a baby-naming ceremony. Trump demurred when asked whether he thought he could do anything to prevent future mass shootings. “The world is a violent world,” the president said. “Before I ran for office, I’d watch instances like this with churches and other things, I’d say, ‘What a shame, what a shame,’” he said, adding that “it’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this kind of a thing happen.” Trump told reporters he is “always” in contact with the National Rifle Association, one of the largest opponents of gun law reform. Bowers will be charged with a hate crime under federal law, Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed Saturday afternoon. Referencing the shooter, Trump also said lawmakers should “stiffen up” death penalty laws and bring capital punishment “into vogue.” “When people do this, they should get the death penalty and shouldn’t have to wait years and years,” he said. “Now the lawyers will get involved, and everybody’s going to get involved, and we’ll be 10 years down the line. I think they should stiffen up laws, and I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue.” Vice President Mike Pence reiterated Trump’s call for the death penalty at a Nevada campaign rally. The president ― a staunch supporter of the death penalty ― infamously took out full-page newspaper ads in 1989 reading “Bring Back The Death Penalty” to comment on a group of teens known as the Central Park Five. The teens were wrongfully convicted of attacking a jogger. Trump has also pushed for the use of armed guards as an effective deterrent to mass shooters, going so far as to suggest some teachers be armed in schools. Research suggests more guns is not the solution, as many mass shooters do not expect to survive their shootings. The president’s remarks stood in sharp contrast to those made by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way,” Wolf said. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal,” he added. Former President Barack Obama also called for action, writing on Twitter, “We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.” Several news outlets have identified the gunman as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, who is currently receiving medical treatment for multiple gunshot wounds. He appears to be strongly anti-Semitic. Law enforcement sources told KDKA that Bowers walked into the synagogue and yelled, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. The gunman had an assault-style rifle and at least three handguns with him at the synagogue, according to Bob Jones, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office. Jones, a 22-year veteran of the FBI, said the synagogue was “the most horrific crime scene” he’d ever seen on the job. Trump once again condemned the attack as he addressed the Future Farmers of America convention in Indiana. “You won’t think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don’t seem to learn from the past,” Trump said. “Our minds can’t comprehend the cruel hate and twisted malice that could cause a person to unleash such terrible violence during a baby-naming ceremony.” He continued: “There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice.” While the president is not Jewish, his daughter Ivanka Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner. This story has been updated with additional comments from Trump and details about the shooting.
---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitter-in-melt-down-after-trump-says-synagogue-needed-armed-guard_us_5bd5198fe4b0d38b58843468---split---Gun control “had little to do” with the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday that killed 11 people, President Donald Trump insisted. But the death toll would have been much lower had the synagogue hired an armed guard, he claimed. Twitter imploded. If the Tree of Life synagogue had an “armed guard inside ... they would have been able to stop them,” Trump told reporters. “Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him,” he added, referring to suspected gunman Robert Bowers. The gunman was armed with an assault rifle and handguns, according to police. Twitter responses slammed Trump for blaming the synagogue for failing to have a guard, and pointed out that four of the six people wounded in the attack were police officers, all armed. They scorched him for his outright refusal to consider how gun laws affect gun violence in America, and for his apparent aim to put even more firearms in people’s hands. But what drove Twitter users particularly bonkers was the idea of armed guards in places of worship. Trump says Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh has “little to do with” gun laws, says the synagogue should have “had some kind of a protection” inside the temple, and later blames synagogue for not having armed guards. pic.twitter.com/AWg5AwkEKp And he never mentioned the victims... Yeah, I'm sure that's the message the churches want to communicate.. pic.twitter.com/8noo57AQAA Yes...bc you of course want guns at a bris. Rabbis with rifles. That's the answer And why stop there. Pastors with pistols. Kids with carbines. Oldies with oozies I would rather place restrictions on who can buy the weapons of war than live in a country where we have to arm teachers and rabbis. Oh yes. So it's the victims' fault yet again. Armed trained police were shot. I’m sure guards would have done so much better. @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump The police were located right around the corner, arrived in one minute, and three of them were shot. The problem is that the killer had an #AssaultWeapon. That's why he killed 11 people before armed police could stop him. #BanAssaultWeapons! Be #ProLife Somebody needs to tell our NRA-bought president that there were armed guards at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Pulse, the high schools in Parkland and Santa Fe, etc. A deranged civilian w/an AR-15 and a death wish will always overpower security guards. What we need is #GunControlNow. @POTUS Really? The guy had an AR-15 style war weapon. What good would a guard at the door done? This is most assuredly a gun issue. How did the guy get a weapon of war? That’s what he wants America to become. Everywhere you go, schools, work, grocery store, place of worship will have armed guards. 😢 #NotInMyAmerica Dystopia. I want less guns. I blame the shooter and anyone who defends having more guns. ANOTHER mass murder event with an AR-15 used. This weapon could be moved to Class 3 weapon status TODAY and would be off store shelves TOMORROW. It could be done with a simple written directive to BATFE to classify the AR-15 as a "Destructive Device" which it obviously is. After getting $30 million from the NRA, Trump will advocate more guns for everyone, probably schoolkids too. My sister lives near there. She had to abandon her car when this happened. She was impressed by the quick action of the police & others. She was horrified by the words of @realDonaldTrump . She says the area is “ a war zone.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

Authorities say that while Bowers' motive remains unknown, "we believe he was acting alone." Eleven people were killed in the attack, and six were injured. "We're in the early stages of this investigation," Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, told reporters during an afternoon press conference. "Over the next several days and weeks, we will look at everything in the suspect's life: his home, his vehicle, his social media, and his movements over the last several days. At this point, we have no knowledge that Bowers was known to law enforcement before today." Bowers, 46, is a resident of Pittsburgh with a history of making anti-Semitic remarks on social media. Some of those remarks appeared under an account believed to belong to Bowers on Gab, an app that says it provides an alternative to anti-conservative bias on Facebook and Twitter. On the account, Bowers posted a link to the website of HIAS, a nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees. The link was for a Shabbat ceremony HIAS planned for refugees in locations across the country. The caption to Bowers' post read, "Why hello there HIAS! You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?" Hours before Saturday morning's shooting, the account posted again, "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, told NPR that he is in "a state of shock." "Refugees flee hate, and for this kind of vile act to happen in our country is devastating, and then on top of that to have it happen in a sanctuary, on the holiest day of the week, is unfathomable," Hetfield said. "There is simply too much space out there for hate, and it's hatred against refugees; hatred against Jews; hatred against Latinos; hatred against transgendered people; hatred against African-Americans; hatred against the other," Hetfield said. "It's just hate across the board, and there's too much space for it now. Everyone has to stand up to it now. We cannot tolerate this intolerance." Gab issued a statement on the synagogue shooting: Shortly after the attack, Gab was alerted to a user profile of the alleged Tree of Life Synagogue shooter. The account was verified and matched the name of the alleged shooter's name, which was mentioned on police scanners. This person also had accounts on other social networks. Gab took swift and proactive action to contact law enforcement immediately. We first backed up all user data from the account and then proceeded to suspend the account. We then contacted the FBI and made them aware of this account and the user data in our possession. We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Officials are treating Robert Bowers' attack on the Tree of Life Congregation as a hate crime. At a press conference Sunday morning, officials said victims of a shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue range in age from 54 to 97. All but two of the victims were over the age of 65, and include one married couple, and two brothers. Six others were wounded, including four police officers. The Allegheny County Chief Medical Examiner released a list of congregants killed in the attack: Joyce Fienberg, 75, of Oakland, City of Pittsburgh Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill David Rosenthal, 54, of Squirrel Hill Cecil and David Rosenthal are brothers Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg Sylvan Simon, 86, of Wilkinsburg Bernice and Sylvan are husband and wife Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill, City of Pittsburgh Irving Younger, 69, of Mt. Washington, City of Pittsburgh Federal prosecutors have charged Robert Bowers, 46, with 29 separate federal crimes for his attack on the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday morning. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said Bowers is charged with 11 counts of murdering victims who were exercising their religious beliefs, and 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. Brady said each of those 11 counts is punishable by death. "The final seven counts are based on the harm inflicted by Bowers, upon the brave police officers, who in trying to stop Bowers rampage, put their own lives in danger. Three of these brave men were shot by Bowers," Brady said at a press conference. At approximately 9:50 a.m., officials say Bowers entered the Tree of Life synagogue, armed with multiple weapons, including three Glock .357 handguns and an AR-15-style weapon. Bowers killed 11 individuals and wounded two others. Four police officers were injured in the attack, and "three of them were shot by Bowers," Brady said. During the shooting, "Bowers made statements regarding genocide, and his desire to kill Jewish people. After a standoff with police, Bowers eventually surrendered, and remains in federal custody today," Brady said. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called it the darkest day in the history of Pittsburgh. "Squirrel Hill is the most diverse neighborhood in all of western Pennsylvania," Peduto told reporters. "People choose to live there because of the diversity of the community. The Jewish community is the backbone. It is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh." "We will not try to rationalize irrational behavior," Peduto continued. "We will work to eradicate it. We will work to eradicate it from our city, from our nation, and our world. Hatred will not have a place anywhere. We will work locally to make those changes happen, and we will work with partners around this country, and around the world, to make sure that it ends." Officials say they are in the early stages of an investigation, and for now, they are treating the attack as a hate crime. Brady said, "A hate crime is where an individual is animated by a hatred or a certain animus towards a person of a certain ethnicity or religious faith, and it becomes domestic terrorism, where there is an ideology that that person is trying to propagate through violence. We continue to see where that line is." At this point, investigators say there is nothing to indicate Bowers had accomplices. Saturday's attack occurred days before the mid-term elections, and amid a surge in hate crimes in the United States. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979. Bowers is scheduled to make an appearance before a federal magistrate judge on Monday, Oct. 29. at 1:30 p.m. ET. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/first-person-mass-murder-mr-171320648.html---split---In this April 10, 2018 photo provided by Matt Bieker, David Michael Slater poses in his Revo, Nev., home. Slater grew up in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, directly across from the Tree of Life Synagogue and like many others is processing Saturday's deadly shooting at the synagogue. (Matt Bieker via AP) Harry Houdini, the Jewish escape artist who thwarted every attempt to cage him, died not long after being punched in the gut by a college student. Houdini's abdominal muscles were legendary, but the student didn't give him enough time to tense them before delivering a blow that ruptured his appendix. Something like this happened to me on Saturday morning. I grew up in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill — in fact, directly across the street and catty corner to the Tree of Life synagogue. Squirrel Hill is one of America's leafiest and loveliest Jewish communities. Synagogues and Jewish shops abound in the hilly little Eden. Heavenly corned-beef sandwiches are easy pickings where orthodox, conservative, reformed, and unaffiliated Jews live harmoniously with their non-Jewish neighbors. The Jewish Community Center is a beehive of multi-faith activity. People are nice to each other in Squirrel Hill. For crying out loud, it was literally Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. We had a mass murder in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. Until today, it seemed inconceivable to me that any American could, at this point, be shocked by a mass murder, even one in their backyard. Those expressing such shock have struck me as willfully self-delusional. Jewish Americans, in particular, are taught pretty much from day one that the veneer of "civilization" is perilously thin and that "It" could happen again. Here. In our lifetimes. And so we must be ever vigilant and wary — perpetually tensed. I was weaned on such worries. And despite how paranoid they seemed on the corner of Shady and Wilkins, I thought I had internalized them. But I wasn't ready for the blow. I wasn't ready to hear the words 'Squirrel Hill' uttered by the president of the United States or the prime minister of Israel. I wasn't prepared to see a law enforcement officer armed to the teeth standing in front of the house where I grew up memorizing Steelers' Super Bowl stats. Or to see a childhood friend interviewed on the news. I was not prepared to wonder how close a connection I would have when the names of the dead were finally released. Now I know what far too many Americans know — not that it can happen anywhere, but the visceral truth that it happened in a place I consider home. This isn't knowledge. It's a wound. You don't want to hear me rant and rave about what I think must change to make this the last mass shooting in America. So instead, I'll tell you something else about Harry Houdini: He managed many of his impossible escapes by hiding keys in the back of his throat. Our key is in our throats as well: our words. Words matter. Words matter. Words. Matter. We live in a cesspool of hateful words, and we are drowning in it. Yet we act surprised when hate rears up in our communities. Mr. Rogers, whose son attended my elementary school, always counseled us to look for the helpers in times of crisis. I took his advice Saturday and was brought to tears by the bravery of Pittsburgh's first responders. And I swelled with pride when several local rabbis declined a news anchor's invitation to offer thoughts and prayers. Instead, they explained that, for Jews, prayer is primarily a personal affair, and that Judaism is first and foremost a religion of action. Unless we see courageous action, the Squirrel Hill massacre will be just another on the list, albeit one with an asterisk for me. You probably have your own. We're a ruptured and bleeding nation in a cage of our own making. I only wish I had the magic key to unlock our hardening hearts. Won't you be my neighbor? ___ David Michael Slater is the author of more than 20 books.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/steve-kerr-and-his-mother-talk-about-the-legacy-of-his-fathers-assassination---split---By Farid Farid June 16, 2016 The Golden State Warriors’ head coach, Steve Kerr. Last week, I spoke on the phone with Ann Kerr, the longtime manager of the Fulbright Scholar Enrichment Program at U.C.L.A. and the mother of the Golden State Warriors' coach, Steve Kerr. Ann and I had originally been scheduled to talk a few days earlier, but there was a shooting on the U.C.L.A. campus—a former Ph.D. student had killed an engineering professor and then himself—and we’d had to postpone. “Events at U.C.L.A. have been unsettling for everyone,” Kerr wrote to me in an e-mail asking to reschedule. “But for me it brought back memories of January 18, 1984 on the A.U.B. campus.” On that day, Malcolm Kerr, Ann’s husband and Steve’s father, was assassinated by members of Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, outside his office at the American University of Beirut, where he was president. Later, when we spoke, Ann Kerr revisited that day. She remembered getting word that Malcolm had been shot, and rushing to his office, where she saw him lying on the ground. It was a rainy day, and she remembers biting down on the handle of her umbrella on the way to the hospital. “I looked at the historic clock tower and I thought, why is that clock still ticking?” she said. “Malcolm is killed; everything is going to come to a standstill.” Before his death, Malcolm Kerr had been a rising star in the world of Middle Eastern history. He and Ann had met in Beirut, in 1954, and they had four children together—Steve was the third. After Malcolm was killed, Ann told me, everyone in the family mourned the loss in a different way. “Steve knew his father loved basketball,” she said. Basketball was an important constant during Steve’s early years, as he grew up in Beirut, Cairo, California, and points in between. He and Malcolm played together often. “Malcolm was quite competitive by nature,” Ann said. “Steve gets it from his father.” As a freshman in high school, Steve attended Cairo American College, an outpost of liberal American education where expat kids mingled in a rarefied space of leafy tranquility within the sprawling metropolis. Steve played basketball there but yearned to return to California, to play at a higher level. His parents obliged him. “He was so eager to play that we decided we’ve got to let him go back home,” Ann told me. “He’s always been single-minded about basketball.” Steve wasn’t exactly a standout player at Pacific Palisades High School, in Los Angeles, but he shot the ball well enough to earn a scholarship from the University of Arizona, where he played under the coach Lute Olson, who was then in his first year at the school. Malcolm Kerr, the father of the Golden State Warriors' coach, Steve Kerr. Photograph by AP Steve started college in the fall of 1983, a few months before his father’s assassination. After Malcolm’s death, basketball became even more of a sanctuary. On YouTube, you can find grainy footage of an interview that Steve gave during his college days, just a few years after the assassination. “Playing basketball took my thoughts away from what was going on,” he says. “It helped me out. It gave me something to fall back into; it gave me some little time to relax.” More than three decades later, Ann reflected on her son’s career and success, and the international popularity of N.B.A. basketball. “People wake up in the middle of the night in Beirut to tune into his games,” she said. “They are proud because he was born there.” In the N.B.A. Finals, Kerr’s Warriors are currently up three games to two over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Before the series began, Ann and her grandchildren made plans to attend Game 5 together, and she’d teased her son, urging him to let his team lose at least one game so that she could go to Oakland to see him. The Cavaliers wound up winning the third game of the series, and on Monday, a few hours before Game 5, Ann e-mailed me, “Hello from Oakland, where we hope the Warriors will win tonight.” Before tipoff, Steve bowed his head during a moment of silence held in memory of the victims of Sunday’s mass shooting in Orlando. Ann and the rest of Steve’s family looked on from the stands. On Wednesday, I spoke briefly with Steve. He had just finished practice. Game 6 loomed on Thursday. He told me how much he had cherished his time growing up in Cairo, and how Beirut called up much more painful memories. I asked about the moment of silence on Monday. “It was very emotional,” he told me. “I was thinking of my dad.” He spoke with empathy about the victims and survivors in Orlando. “It’s very personal, because you’ve gone through it,” he said. “You understand how much they are suffering, just like how our family went through that suffering. When you think of it, all of these statistics have names and these names have faces. They are people who are now lost.” Farid Farid is a journalist based in Cairo and Berlin.

---split---2.0---split---https://nypost.com/2018/10/28/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-crushes-steve-kerr-were-broken/---split---Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Sports By Brian Lewis  October 28, 2018 | 6:57pm The day after a gunman walked into the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh with an AR-15-style assault weapon and three handguns and killed 11 people, Warriors coach Steve Kerr somberly called the country “broken” and again begged for stricter gun control. “It’s just devastating,” Kerr said before his Warriors faced the Nets on Sunday at Barclays Center. “I just expect it now, and that’s the sad thing. I remember watching an interview with a student after the Santa Fe shooting — a shooting at Texas Santa Fe high school — a 14-year-old girl. And she was asked does this shock you? And she said, ‘No, I kind of expected that this would happen to us at our school at some point.’ “And that’s where we’ve gotten as a country. We’re broken right now. So nothing surprises us anymore, nothing surprises me anymore, whether its shootings at schools, churches, synagogues, malls, movie theaters. We need our leaders to step up, unite the country with the appropriate words, the appropriate actions, and we’re not getting that right now. It’s frustrating, and I don’t know what else to say.” Kerr — whose father, Malcolm, was assassinated in Beirut by two gunmen in 1984 — has been one of the most outspoken coaches in sports. When asked why others haven’t been quite as vocal, he said some are, but urged others to make their voices heard in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. REUTERS REUTERS REUTERS REUTERS View Slideshow “I don’t know. I’m not sure. You have to feel comfortable talking about whatever issue you’re addressing. Not everybody feels comfortable in certain situations and circumstances,” Kerr said. “But more and more you’re seeing people in the sports world, athletes and coaches, speaking out because the times call for it. It’s easy to feel how broken we are right now, our country is.

(Istock) A Wisconsin man has been cited for violating a state statute after he shot an elk across a roadway during the state’s inaugural elk hunt. Joe Wiltzius, 73, of Franklin, was charged with illegally shooting the first bull elk of the season by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Journal Sentinel reports. AMERICAN EAGLE FLIGHT STRIKES, KILLS DEER DURING TAKEOFF AT PENNSYLVANIA AIRPORT The man was reportedly hunting with a guide and a friend on Oct. 15 when, around 3:30 pm, he fired across the street from 100 yards away. According to the Sentinel, the men dragged the elk into the woods to gut it and phoned a DNR biologist to verify the kill and take samples. Dave Zebro, DNR warden supervisor, told the Sentinel the men were interviewed and an investigation was opened into the hunt, which revealed Wiltzius had broken laws, including shooting across a roadway and hunting within 50 feet of the center line of a roadway. He may also face a $2,000 wild animal surcharge for the kill. SOUTH CAROLINA FAMILY ASKS HUNTERS NOT TO KILL PET DEER The hide and antlers of the elk were seized by the DNR. The venison will be held until the case is decided, and then will likely be donated to a food pantry, the Sentinel reports. The friend and guide have not been charged, but the guide may lose his license. Wiltzius was one of five non-tribal hunters in the state to receive tags through the DNR lottery for the first-ever regulated elk season. Five other tags were reserved for members of Wisconsin’s Native American tribes. HUNTER AND HOST OF 'LARYSA UNLEASHED' SLAMMED FOR POSING WITH DEAD GOAT IN SCOTLAND The state decided to open the hunt this year because the population of elk exceeded 200 — the state requirement for a limited bull hunt. The DNR received around 38,000 applications and $13,000 in donations for the hunt, the Sentinel reports. “Many partners and individuals contributed to this great conservation story in Wisconsin, which allowed us to hold this first hunt,” Schaller said to the Sentinel. “The state is dedicated to ensuring hunting laws are honored to make sure it is a fair and safe hunt, and this case is a reflection of that.” FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS The state’s elk season will through Nov. 11., and then from Dec. 13 to Dec. 21.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-sarah-scott-kip-pardue-20181028-story.html#nt=tertiarynavbar---split---Sarah Scott was lying under the covers wearing only nipple covers and boy shorts when, she says, her co-star Kip Pardue became aroused. She could tell because he took her hand and placed it on his groin just as they were about to film a post-coital scene for an independent television pilot, “Mogulettes.”  She was shocked by his behavior, particularly because it happened on May 16, mere months after hundreds of allegations of sexual misconduct had been made against powerful men in Hollywood.  Still, Scott shot the scene. When filming was done, she says Pardue called her into his dressing room, where he proceeded to masturbate in front of her.  “I literally froze,” Scott, 35, recalls. “I said, ‘What are you doing?’”  “This isn’t a #MeToo thing,” she alleges he responded. “I’m not your employer. It’s not like I can fire you.”  Scott says she ran out of the room. She had been a working actress for more than 14 years, appearing on episodes of popular television shows such as “True Blood” and “Castle,” but had never experienced a co-star doing something like this. Pardue, who is a series regular on Marvel’s Hulu series “The Runaways,” has appeared in films such as “Remember the Titans” and “The Rules of Attraction” over his two-decade career. The pilot they were filming did not yet have a network or streaming partner attached, but producers hoped to attract interest after it was completed.  As Scott encountered Pardue while preparing to leave the set of “Mogulettes,” she says she asked him why he had masturbated in front of her. She says he told her it was because she was “just so hot.”  When contacted by The Times, Pardue apologized for placing Scott’s hand on his penis during their scene together. But he denied everything the actress alleges that happened after the scene was completed.  "I clearly misread the situation during a sex scene on set and have apologized to Sarah,” Pardue, 43, said in a statement provided by his representative, David Shane. “I never intended to offend her in any way and deeply regret my actions and have learned from my behavior."  When Scott returned home from the set that day, she told her husband what had happened. It was the first of many times she would share her story.  From reaching out to the show’s producers, the Screen Actors Guild and the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund to filing a police report with the Hermosa Beach Police Department, Scott did everything she thought she was supposed to do — following all of the protocols that had been touted by the entertainment industry in the wake of last fall’s reckoning.  “How can I be part of the solution? How can I do right by my community?” she recalls thinking at the time. “What can I do that’s actually going to make a dent in preventing this guy from doing this again?”  But for five months, she was frustrated by what she saw as slow movement and conflicting advice from industry and production leaders. After nearly a year of industry hand-wringing and fundraising, of hotline and subcommittee creation, of vows by guilds and studios, she says she feels Hollywood remains a business with many temporary workplaces overseen by a wide variety of people with varying degrees of authority.  After sharing the story with her husband, Scott says the next people she reported the incident to were “Mogulettes” director Dave Fraunces and producer Mandy Henderson.  “Sarah asked to speak with [us] the moment she got on set,” Fraunces says. “I did not suspect anything like that had occurred until Sarah mentioned it to me. I was shocked.”  Pardue had completed his work on the set and the project’s executive producer, Bennett Talsky, says he reported the claims to a SAG-AFTRA business representative. Talsky, whose background is in construction consulting, was segueing into entertainment for the first time with "Mogulettes” and says he felt unsure of the protocol to follow. He called both actors to get their version of events, but Pardue “danced around the whole thing and never admitted to it,” Talsky says.  “He was trying to justify it, saying they had really good chemistry and he got carried away,” Talsky adds. “It didn’t get anywhere, and I didn’t really confront him — I was just trying to feel him out and see if he felt like he had screwed up.” What can I do that’s actually going to make a dent in preventing this guy from doing this again?  On May 21, Scott decided to personally follow up with SAG-AFTRA. She searched the union’s website and determined she should get in touch with the union’s Equal Employment Opportunities and Diversity Department. The man who answered the phone said he was new to the department but requested that Scott recount the entire on-set incident with Pardue, which she did. She was told that she would soon be contacted by Donna Reed, the department coordinator.  The following day, she connected with Reed, who presented her with a number of resources via email.  “While this is not intended to pass judgment on anyone involved, I am terribly sorry for what you experienced,” said Reed’s May 22 email, which Scott provided to The Times. “If anyone who believes they were subjected to unlawful harassment, the fact that they do not remain silent empowers us all to shine a light in the dark and take action against this behavior so that it is less likely to be repeated.”  Reed listed a number of options for Scott. She could make a member-to-member union complaint, which would be handled by SAG-AFTRA’s legal department. She could file a police report with the L.A. Police Department. She could contact a lawyer via the union’s free legal hotline or the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. She could seek therapeutic counseling through the Actors Fund or the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN.  Scott felt overwhelmed. She didn’t feel that she needed to call the crisis center. She was unsure if going to the police would make a difference. And she didn’t want to sue Pardue for any financial gain. She just wanted to help make the industry safer for women.  She thought her best move might be to file a member-to-member complaint with SAG-AFTRA. Per Reed’s suggestion, Scott reached out to the organization’s legal department and was connected with Delia Aparicio, senior counsel at SAG-AFTRA. Again, she was asked to recount the incident.  “I feel like her intentions were good, but it was clear that she was very inexperienced with this particular kind of process,” Scott recalls. “If I had a question about confidentiality — ‘Can I talk to the media? Can I talk to agents and managers about this?’ — she kept saying, ‘I’m going to have to check on that.’”  Scott also says she was told by Aparicio, who declined multiple requests to comment for this story, that if she pursued the member-to-member route, “you’re probably not gonna be satisfied.”  “The feeling I got was, ‘It’s really not worth your time,’” says Scott, who was told the process typically takes six to nine months. “And yet that was the only thing you could do through SAG.”  Although Aparicio did not speak with The Times about Scott’s description of their communication, Pamela Greenwalt, SAG-AFTRA’s chief communications and marketing officer, provided an overview of the member-to-member reporting process, referring to an article in the union’s constitution about “Discipline of Members.”  “Legal and disciplinary matters are strictly confidential and thus, as is customary, SAG-AFTRA declined to comment on your specific inquiry,” Greenwalt said on behalf of the guild.  After her conversation with Aparicio, Scott says she sought advice from a few trusted individuals. One of them was Kevin Kane, an actor and comedian who frequently collaborates with Amy Schumer. Because of Schumer’s involvement with Time’s Up, he thought the actress could help. With Scott’s permission, he told Schumer on May 24 about the situation and Schumer texted Kane with direct contact information for Time’s Up and SAG-AFTRA representatives.  The Emmy-winning comedian says she feels the union has a “long way to go” to ensure safety on set, in auditions and rehearsals. "Most actresses I know have experienced violations on set of a sexual nature, including myself,” Schumer told The Times. “You can be shooting a scene — or even auditioning a scene and your scene partner can take it too far. And if you speak up about it, you're made to feel difficult." Scott had filmed intimate moments in projects before “Mogulettes,” and says it’s rare for any production member to discuss the details of such a scene before shooting it. That was the case on “Mogulettes,” where she says she and Pardue never had a conversation about how to approach their scripted kissing scene. "It was just kind of, like, 'Go!'" she says. "It was pretty awkward." Last week, HBO announced that the network will hire "intimacy coordinators" to monitor any sexually intimate scenes filmed on the sets of its programs. Scott says that such an individual might have prevented the alleged misconduct that happened during "Mogulettes." "Walking through the intimacy of a scene could be super preventative," the actress says. "We have weapon masters. We have stunt choreographers. A designated position for this kind of work is encouraging to me." Sympathetic to Scott’s plight, Schumer, connected her with Rebecca Rottenberg Goldman, the chief operating officer of Time’s Up. Goldman sent Scott to Katherine Atkinson, a lawyer who had volunteered her services to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has received more than $20 million from Time’s Up to help women who could not afford legal counsel.  On May 25, when Scott told Atkinson that she did not want to file a civil suit, the lawyer advised her to speak with Kendra Barkoff, a public relations consultant with SKDKnickerbocker who represents Time’s Up.  Scott agreed to speak with Barkoff, again recounting her on-set allegations. Barkoff said that if Scott was interested in telling her story to a reporter, she could help connect her with different media outlets. Eventually, Barkoff referred Scott to The Times.  Meanwhile, Scott continued to discuss her legal options with Atkinson, but on their third phone call, the lawyer told Scott that she would need to pay Atkinson $2,500 to retain her services.  Scott had assumed Atkinson was working pro bono, but some lawyers working through the Legal Defense Fund ask to be paid. According to Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, not all of the attorneys affiliated with the organization charge a $2,500 retainer. “Some work pro bono, some work for less, and we’ve had cases where they applied for funding to cover the retainer for the client — ‘We’ll take this case if we get funding, and if we don’t, we won’t,’” she said.  Atkinson later said Scott could file for financial aid through the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, but told her “it wasn’t 100% certain they would reimburse” her.  Unwilling to take the financial risk, Scott set aside the idea of retaining an attorney and returned to SAG-AFTRA. Schumer had connected her with actress Frances Fisher, a member of SAG-AFTRA's National Board who told The Times she proposed Scott reach out directly to the union’s president, Gabrielle Carteris. Scott emailed her, relaying how she felt the union had let her down.  “Gabrielle got back to me that night thanking me for sharing this,” says Scott, who began to read aloud from Carteris’ email: “I am eager to hear how the Time’s Up will help on this issue. As for the union, I am making sure that this is reviewed as we continue developing best procedures and support systems.”  Through Greenwalt, Carteris declined to comment specifically on Scott’s case.  Bolstered by the quick response from Carteris, Scott decided to move forward with the member-to-member complaint, which she initiated on June 11. Two weeks later, she received a questionnaire in the mail asking her to recount her experience and share any witnesses and documentary evidence. She did that and sent the questionnaire back to the union the same day. Speaking out about this has been extraordinarily difficult for me, and now I understand why so many people don’t.  By the end of August, she had heard nothing — not even an acknowledgement that the paperwork was received. On Aug. 26, she filed a police report with Officer Brent Zuber at the Hermosa Beach Police Department.  "Since I wasn't interested in pursuing any kind of civil case, I felt it was one of my duties to go on record in this way,” Scott says. (The Hermosa Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.)  Hoping to receive an update from SAG-AFTRA, Scott messaged Carteris, who said she would check on the status of the complaint. The following day, Scott was informed that her case would be heard by the guild’s disciplinary committee on Oct. 26. (According to the guild, “hearings are not granted unless staff believes there is probable cause.”)  That committee would decide if Pardue should be expelled or suspended from the guild, which would mean loss of work and possibly health insurance, or sanctioned another way.  In mid-October, Barkoff, learning that Scott did not have a lawyer, secured Atkinson’s representation for her without the retainer. By that time, the SAG-AFTRA hearing was just days away, and Atkinson was unable to travel at the last-minute from her office in Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.  Both parties jointly agreed to enter mediation, which meant the hearing was postponed. If either side is dissatisfied with the mediation process, they can still proceed with the guild hearing.  Jonathan Steinsapir, Pardue's attorney, says his client "would welcome a SAG hearing or any other fair process to resolve this matter."  “I am disappointed that Kip has chosen to hide behind his actions,” Scott says. “Speaking out about this has been extraordinarily difficult for me, and now I understand why so many people don’t. My goal remains the same — my wish is for Kip to take full responsibility for all of his actions.”  Despite close to six months of regular phone calls with lawyers, SAG-AFTRA officials and other industry support staff, Scott says she remained hopeful that sharing her story might create change in the entertainment business.  “In Hollywood terms, I am not a name, but I am a working actress,” she says. “This is how I make my money, and help support my family. I’ve been out in Los Angeles pounding the pavement as a proud union member for 15 years. I was sexually violated while at work, and even though I had the courage to tell anyone and everyone who’d listen, as time went on it seemed like I had very little control in truly preventing this from happening to anyone else.”  ALSO:  Time's Up has kept #MeToo in the spotlight and raised $22 million.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gab-social-media-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting_us_5bd6c01de4b055bc948d9f04---split---Gab.com, the self-described “free speech social media platform” popular with alt-right activists and white nationalists, has gone offline after facing widespread backlash in the aftermath of Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Several companies that had provided Gab with crucial services to keep the site running ― including its domain provider ― have cut ties with the platform, forcing it to go temporarily offline. Gab, however, has vowed to get the site back up and running as soon as possible. The suspected gunman in the synagogue attack, Robert Bowers, had posted brazenly racist and anti-Semitic views on Gab prior to the rampage, thereby thrusting the site into the national spotlight. Gab is an online gathering place favored by far-right users whose offensive and bigoted comments would get them kicked off of other social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Bowers, who joined Gab in January, had posted messages on the site referring to Jews as an “infestation” and “the children of Satan.” On Saturday morning, just moments before 11 people were shot dead at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, Bowers had denounced the Jewish nonprofit group HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, in a Gab post. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” the post read. Since the shooting, several companies have distanced themselves from Gab. The platform’s domain provider, GoDaddy, said on Sunday that it had informed the site that it had “24 hours to move the domain to another registrar.” “They have violated our terms of service,” GoDaddy told Mashable in a statement. “In response to complaints received over the weekend, GoDaddy investigated and discovered numerous instances of content on the site that both promotes and encourages violence against people.” Payments websites PayPal and Stripe, as well as Gab’s hosting service Joyent, have also told the platform to take its business elsewhere, Reuters reported. pic.twitter.com/MR39HQflIE Gab said on Twitter that it was “under attack.” “We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the site said — adding that it was transitioning to a new hosting provider, though it did not say who the new web host was. Gab said it was “working around the clock” to get the platform back online. “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN,” the site declared in a Sunday tweet. New hosting provider secured. Working around the clock to see to it that https://t.co/J3Rfto6fi3 stays online. You can’t stop the power of The People in their fight for freedom and liberty against tyranny. FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN. pic.twitter.com/IFZbwqf5YZ Founded in 2016 by pro-Trump conservative Andrew Torba, Gab describes itself as a defender of “individual liberty and free expression online.” As NPR has noted, the site allows users to basically post “whatever they want, as long as it’s legal.” That’s led to message boards full of “anti-Semitism, racism, Nazism and sexism,” and a plethora of conspiracy theories. Several prominent figures on the far-right are users of the site, including right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos; Andrew Anglin, the founder of neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer; and radio show host Alex Jones.

The move comes after GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. “We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar,” a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that “promotes and encourages violence against people.” The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps Jewish refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill “my people.” “Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.

The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was taken into custody after surrendering to police. He was transported to a local hospital with unspecified injuries. FBI Special Agent Bob Jones said that Bowers was armed with an “AR-15 style” rifle in addition to three handguns. Bowers was not known to law enforcement before Saturday, Jones added. According to KDKA, Pittsburgh’s CBS affiliate, Bowers walked into the building and yelled “All Jews must die” before opening fire. Federal officials are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. Bowers was an active user of Gab, a Twitter alternative that promotes itself as supporting free speech. An account appearing to belong to Bowers — now deactivated — was littered with anti-Semitic messages. His bio on the site read “jews are the children of satan.” The most recent post, published shortly before the shooting, criticized the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) for its resettlement of refugees. “HIAS likes to bring in invaders that kill our people,” he wrote. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughters.” The post concluded with a chilling message: “Screw your optics, I’m going in.” In a post from two days ago, Bowers wrote that President Trump is “a globalist, not a nationalist.” It also referred to the so-called “QAnon” conspiracy. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he added. In another online post, Bowers showed off his collection of handguns, calling them “my glock family.” In a statement, Gab administrators said they suspended Bowers’s profile once they’d been alerted to a verified account matching the name of the suspected shooter. “We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served,” they wrote, and also declared, “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” Neighbors of the alleged gunman expressed disbelief. Danielle Manko, 32, who lives across the street from the alleged shooter’s most recent address, told Yahoo News that “he’s usually never there.” “I haven’t seen him in probably like three weeks,” she said, adding, “They always kept to themselves.” Another resident who lives near Bowers’s apartment complex, 63-year-old Terrence Holleran, said it was “as much of a surprise to us as it was to anyone else” that an alleged shooter lived there. “This is not an area that has a lot of problems,” Holleran said. “It’s just unfortunate that this asshole decided to live here.” With Yahoo News’ correspondent Matt Stroud reporting from Pittsburgh _____ Read more from Yahoo News:

One congregation leader said their training in active-shooter situations had helped save lives. When the suspect was detained after a shootout, he reportedly told Swat officers he wanted "all Jews to die". The 11 victims were named on Sunday and included a husband and wife, and a woman aged 97. Another six people were injured, including four policemen. Mayor Bill Peduto said that this was the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history". The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 criminal charges over what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. He is still in hospital being treated for multiple gunshot wounds but is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Three congregations were reportedly meeting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill district of Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Members of the New Light congregation were meeting in a basement area, Carl Solomon, 81, a congregation member who turned back from the synagogue but had spoken to survivors, told the New York Times. Richard Gottfried, 65, and Daniel Stein, 71, were in the kitchen and both were shot dead. Congregation co-president Stephen Cohen told the paper there was "no place to hide" there. He said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman had shepherded two other people into a storage room, although one, Melvin Wax, 88, chose to later open the door and was shot dead. Mr Cohen said "everyone froze but Rabbi Perlman". He told the Associated Press news agency that leaders had taken part in active-shooter drills "and I think that's what ultimately saved the people who were saved". Worshipper Joseph Charny, 90, said he saw a man appear at the door and heard shots. He told the Washington Post: "I looked up and there were all these dead bodies." He said he and two others hid in an upstairs storage room until it was safe to come out. They were named on Sunday as Joyce Fienberg, 75; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his brother David, 54; married couple Bernice Simon, 84, and Sylvan Simon, 86; and Irving Younger, 69. Tributes have been pouring in from those who knew the victims. Myron Snider described his friend Melvin Wax as a "sweet, sweet guy" and unfailingly generous. Ben Schmitt, a patient of Jerry Rabinowitz, said the family medical practitioner was "kind and funny... [he] completely personified the term 'bedside manner'". Cecil and David Rosenthal were described as "kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around". One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another was due to be released on Sunday, with the other two needing more treatment. By Hugo Bachega in Pittsburgh All day during a cold, grey Sunday, residents and others brought flowers and candles to the entrance of the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Jewish life in Pittsburgh. There were words of disbelief and a common determination that they would not allow this tragedy to change such a vibrant place. "You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole," said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. At an evening vigil at a local hall, hundreds gathered inside, dozens more outside in the light rain, to say this was an attack not only on one community but on their entire city. The message: "Love will defeat hatred, light will defeat darkness." He was armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He owned them legally, a law enforcement officer told the Associated Press. Officers arrived after receiving calls about an active shooter at 09:54 local time (13:54 GMT) on Saturday and encountered the suspect as he was trying to leave. The gunman fired at them and ran upstairs. As Swat officers searched for victims, the gunman opened fire on them and injured two. The suspect was detained after being wounded in an exchange of fire with officers. Officials said the gunman had made statements regarding genocide as well as a desire to kill Jewish people. There are few details about Robert Bowers but there is a trail of anti-Semitic comments on social media. His neighbour, Chris Hall, told AP: "The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed." Officials said there was nothing to indicate he had any accomplices. FBI special agent Robert Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. The 29 charges were announced in a statement issued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: He described the gunman as a "maniac" and suggested the US should "stiffen up our laws of the death penalty". "These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop," he said. Mr Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh soon and had ordered US flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast until 31 October. He added that the shooting had "little to do" with US gun laws. "If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation." But Mayor Peduto, a Democrat, said: "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder." The Boeing 737, carrying 189 people, vanished shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital. 15 sayings from around the world

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/for-once-robert-covington-steals-show---split---It’s usually easy to notice when Robert Covington doesn’t play well. Missed threes, getting torched by the opposing star, bad fouls — the signs are obvious. It’s not always as clear to recognize when Covington does play well, but everyone who watched the Sixers beat the Hornets on Saturday night, 105-103 (see observations), was reminded how important Covington is to this team. Head coach Brett Brown said postgame Covington was the Sixers’ bell ringer (the player Brown chooses to ring a miniature replica Liberty Bell in the locker room after a win), and that’s no surprise. Covington was excellent on both ends of the floor. Defensively, he was his usual, disruptive self with two steals and four blocks. Covington was tasked with guarding Kemba Walker, who entered averaging 30.8 points per game on 49.2 percent shooting. Walker scored 37 on Saturday, but he shot 11 for 31. Much of his success came when Covington was off the floor. Covington guarded Walker late in the fourth quarter, and he shut him down when it mattered. “Robert Covington played an amazing game on Kemba, made it tough for him to score,” Ben Simmons. “But also, you know, it’s Kemba, so he’s always going to score. But I thought he did a great job.” A lot of what Covington excels at doesn’t show up in the box score — another 20-point, 10-rebound night from Joel Embiid is often going to get more headlines than solid off-ball defense and deflections. Covington takes on the responsibility of guarding the opponent’s best player most nights. Through the first five games, he hadn’t played to the First Team All-Defense standard he set last year, and the Sixers' defense overall had't been very good. in fact, Covington's 112.7 defensive rating was actually second-worst on the team heading into the game vs. Charlotte. But against one of the better scorers in the NBA, Covington knew he needed to be at his best. “Short, quick, shifty, quick burst speed,” Covington said of Walker. “But I gotta guard some great superstars each and every night. So it was just another one of those tasks that I had to buckle down. We needed a win, so I had to do whatever it takes.” Offensively, Covington hit perhaps the biggest shot of the game for the Sixers, a three-pointer from the right wing with just under two minutes remaining to put the Sixers up, 105-101. His 18 points (4 for 7 from three-point range) were needed on a night in which Simmons made just 5 of 20 field-goal attempts. Covington knows his contributions tend to fly under the radar and he says that doesn’t bother him. “From the outside looking in, a lot of people don’t understand what all goes into it,” he said. “You can’t get caught up in that. The people who understand the way the game is and how everything goes can get a better feel for it, how everything happens. You just can’t get caught in what they’re saying, you just have to focus in.” There probably won’t be many more games this season where Covington’s value is so apparent to the casual observer. Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz are usually going to steal the show. But on Saturday night, Covington made it obvious how integral he is to the Sixers’ success.

Brett Brown wants Fultz to attack the rim ‘like you’re going to dunk everything’ Nothing questionable about that — Embiid comes up big again Saric 'absolutely' would be better NBA player if he didn't play for Croatia Sixers saw in Milwaukee how good Middleton could be for them Embiid receives warning for flopping Let me set the scene for you. It’s Friday night at Camden’s Mastery Charter School Cramer Hill in New Jersey and Sixers ENT is getting 20 middle school girls amped up for their basketball clinic. When I say amped up, picture girls dancing in their basketball shorts, laughing and singing while music is blaring and the Dunk Squad is doing flips throughout the gym. It’s impossible not to smile, especially if you’re Mike Muscala, who’s waiting to get introduced before he hosts a youth basketball clinic as part of “Her Time to Play,” a new NBA initiative helping inspire young girls to learn and play basketball in a positive and healthy way. After Muscala stops dancing himself, he picks up the mic. “What you just showed is something that is contagious, and that is being fun and being positive," Muscala said. "That’s what basketball should be all about and that’s what I want today to be about.” For Muscala, having strong women around was something that influenced him when he was growing up. His aunt played college basketball and her presence and support was definitely something that stood out to him. “As a younger kid, she would come support me at my games," Muscala said, "and my cousin was a really good college player, too, so I think being around her at a young age was really cool and inspiring for me, because she was the best athlete in our family, so to be able to see that as a woman was pretty cool.” The girls are a mix of mostly seventh and eighth graders from the basketball teams at Cramer Hill and H.B. Wilson Family School in Camden. As the principal of Cramer Hill, Jessie Gismondi, proudly tells me, all of the girls participating have to be doing well and trouble-free in school. “This is the coolest. I am so proud,” Gismondi said. “The Sixers are the coolest partner ever. The kids have been looking forward to this all week.” For Muscala, there’s a special girl in the audience. Her name is Gianni, and she has been chosen as his mentee as part of the Sixers Youth Foundation’s "Walk In My Shoes" program. Muscala first met Gianni on Sep. 28 at the Sixers' preseason game against Melbourne United. “She’s super bright,” Muscala says of Gianni. “When I read about her they were saying what a team player she is and she’s just an attentive person. She has so many interests for her age.” Gianni (who also plays multiple instruments) has been playing basketball since she was 4 years old. She’s a speedy small forward and she plans to play in high school and in college and "make it to the leagues someday soon." As far as what she wants to do for a career when she grows up, although she’s still deciding, it’s easy to tell she’s already wise beyond her years. “I’m not entirely sure,” Gianni said. “But I don’t want to work a job where I have to do one thing constantly over and over again. I want to be able to do something where I can do multiple things every day, and I just want it to be fun.” The plan is for Gianni and Muscala to check in with each other frequently throughout the season, and Muscala is looking forward to the day where Gianni feels comfortable asking him any question. “I’m looking forward to it because it’s my first time getting to continually work with someone throughout the year," Muscala said, "as opposed to a one day thing where they might be nervous. But I hope we get to a point where she can ask me questions.” Gianni hasn’t felt comfortable enough yet to ask Muscala a ton of questions, but when she does, she’s got one ready. “How tall is he? Because, he is very tall.” I thought I’d tell her he’s listed at 6-foot-11, but I didn’t want to ruin her first question. Click here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Sixers weekly observations: Embiid workload, low turnover numbers, more For once, Robert Covington steals the show Fultz needs to attack the rim ‘like you’re going to dunk everything’ Nothing questionable about that — Embiid comes up big again Saric 'absolutely' would be better NBA player if he didn't play for Croatia Every Sunday this season, we’ll have a few observations on the week that was for the Sixers. The Sixers are 3-3, and there’s a good excuse for every loss. The Celtics are a better team. Ben Simmons was out against Detroit, and Blake Griffin scored 50 points. Milwaukee is a tough place to play the second game of a back-to-back. Still, it’s clear the Sixers aren’t playing near their pear level. With the team adjusting to new, switch-heavy defensive concepts and transitioning from the most effective starting lineup in the league last season to one with Markelle Fultz trying to find his way, that’s not a great surprise. • If the Sixers were 2-4, it would be in large part because of the worst shooting night of Simmons’ NBA career. Simmons’ 5 for 20 performance was the second-lowest field goal percentage of his career. His previous low was a 1 for 6 effort in the regular-season finale last year vs. the Bucks. He gave himself a “D” for his play against the Hornets, and you can see why — it’s very rare for him to miss that many easy shots around the rim. • After Saturday night’s win over the Hornets, Brett Brown said Joel Embid’s 37 minutes were “too many.” However, Embiid’s heavy load (even after rolling his ankle in Friday’s practice) hasn’t been an outlier early in the season. He’s averaging 35.8 minutes, tied for ninth in the league. Brown said in training camp that there’d be no restrictions on Embiid this season, but it makes sense that he’d want to manage the load of his star, who is playing like the MVP candidate he said he wanted to be, averaging 29.2 points, 12.7 rebounds and 3.8 assists. For Embiid’s minutes to go down, Amir Johnson and Mike Muscala would likely have to see the court more. Johnson’s 11.1 minutes per game would be the lowest of his career. His 114.1 defensive rating is worst on the team. • Though Wilson Chandler won’t solve all the Sixers’ problems once he returns to the court, he can help fill a couple serious holes. Chandler has yet to make his regular season Sixers debut; he’s been sidelined since suffering a hamstring strain in the first preseason game on Sep. 28. He was a partial participant in Friday’s practice. Against opponents like the Bucks, Chandler’s defense on the wing would have been a substantial upgrade over that of Landry Shamet and Furkan Korkmaz. His ability to create his own offense would also be welcome on a second unit that has lacked scoring options outside of “sixth man” JJ Redick, who is averaging 31.4 minutes, fourth-most on the team. • The Sixers have turned the ball over just 12.8 times per game, fourth-fewest in the NBA. While the Sixers’ coaching staff believes low turnover numbers don’t guarantee success (and the Sixers’ .500 record supports that philosophy), it’s still an encouraging stat. Embiid’s drop from 3.7 turnovers per game last season to 2.2 turnovers per contest in the first six games is an especially positive sign. • We’ll take a close look at Markelle Fultz’s past few games in our weekly Fultz stock watch, but here’s one note before then: Fultz is spending a lot of time standing either in the corner or in the short corner “dunker spot.” Along with having the confidence to take open jumpers, Fultz’s off-ball movement outside of the structure of the offense is key when he plays as a two-guard.

It was all just the “libs’ empty threat” . . . until it happened. Gab is expendable. A forum of 400k is easy as hell to squash. Those deplorables are a drop in the cyber bucket.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/right-wing-platforms-provide-refuge-digital-outcasts-alex-jones-n899161---split---When YouTube banned the channels of Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Monday, Mike Adams was ready and waiting. Adams is the founder of Real.Video, a platform he launched in March after he, too, was kicked off YouTube for what it called violations of community guidelines. His website markets itself as the “solution to YouTube censorship and anti-liberty authoritarianism.” His is one of a small group of tech startups that have emerged catering to users increasingly deemed too extreme or controversial for Facebook, Google and Apple, all of which removed Jones’ content from its platforms this week. And with Jones looking for new platforms, these small operations are beginning to see an uptick in users. By Tuesday, Jones announced that he would be posting 1,000 of his most-viewed anti-government and conspiracy videos to Adams’ site. According to Adams’ latest video, Jones’ move to the Real.Video platform has caused a surge in new users and the creation of over 350 new channels on the site in the last day, an uptick from the “dozens” that he noted in a video three weeks ago. The need for these kinds of platforms is a recent development. Just a few years ago, most major tech companies balked at calls to limit trolling, hate speech and even harassment, with many citing free speech principles and the challenges of moderating millions of users. Growing criticism over the role these companies have played in spreading inflammatory content — magnified by Russia’s use of tech platforms to spread misinformation, particularly in the 2016 U.S. presidential election — has slowly pushed tech giants to take a more hands-on role in policing their networks. The widespread removal of Jones was the biggest single crackdown by platforms on a bad actor, but it was also just the latest in a long series of bans that have pushed extremists into lesser-traveled corners of the internet. For years, often with scant evidence, users on the right have complained that tech companies punish and silence the expression of conservative thought. Now, the deplatforming of Jones is offering companies that cater to those self-described victims of Silicon Valley their first real, if far-fetched, hope of a rules-free experience. Andrew Torba, who appeared on Infowars on Tuesday along with Adams to talk with Jones about “the globalist tech gatekeepers,” founded Gab.ai shortly after Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, the conservative provocateur. While the social network promotes a hard-line view in support of free speech, critics often refer to it as “Twitter for racists.” Researchers who have studied Gab found that it acts as a meeting place and an echo chamber for white, male extremists, and the company’s app has already been banned from the Apple and Google app stores. “You are just the start,” Torba told Jones on his program. “They tried to malign us and call us a Nazi social network.” Gab is not the first company to try to find success as a right-wing niche. Codias launched as an alternative for conservatives fed up with Facebook. Conservapedia offers a right-leaning version of Wikipedia. Hatreon provides a crowdfunding service to replace Patreon. And there’s even TrumpSingles for those who lean too far right for Tinder. None have managed to approach their rivals’ popularity, though victimhood has proven a powerful fundraising tool. Torba did not reply to a request for comment, but in May, Gab’s then-chief operating officer Utsav Sanduja told NBC News the platform had 466,000 users, with 1,000 concurrent users on the platform at any given time. As for funding, Gab crowdsourced $1.1 million in 2017 and Sanduja claimed in May that the platform was bringing in more than $20,000 a month in both memberships and donations from users. While it’s still dwarfed by Twitter’s 335 million active users, Gab claims it has been growing, and Jones’ backing can only help. Notably, Twitter was one of the few platforms that declined to remove Jones. Its CEO Jack Dorsey explained in a series of tweets that Jones — currently being sued by several families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting for spreading a conspiracy theory that the shooting had been staged — had not violated Twitter’s rules. Ezra Levant, founder of the far-right Canadian media outlet Rebel Media, found similar success in raising money for a YouTube alternative. In August 2017, YouTube announced it would be placing tighter controls on content — removing videos containing “hate speech and violent extremism,” while preventing ads from appearing alongside “controversial religious or supremacist content.” In response to the tougher standard, which he called a threat to the Rebel channel, Levant launched a crowdfunded effort to build “a conservative alternative” to YouTube. Originally planned as an “in-house system” for conservative video content, Levant was able to raise almost $200,000, about two-thirds of its goal, according to the still-live crowdfunding site. The app has been live for months now, Levant said. Levant told NBC News that the new Jones ban has caused him to again question whether he will be able to continue to operate on YouTube. “At the Rebel, we are one standard deviation closer to the center than Infowars,” Levant said. “Being conservative in Canada is pretty much being in the center in the U.S. But we do not have the First Amendment here, so we are at the mercy of political inquisitions.” While these platforms may hope to create free-speech utopias, they can run into similar problems as other platforms. Sanduja quietly moved on from Gab in July, amid reports of infighting between alt-right users who sent Sanduja death threats and Gab management, who later alleged that the increase in Nazi activity was a result of a campaign by social justice warriors to infiltrate their service and cause discord. Sanduja told NBC News he left Gab “to move onto better things,” and had “reached all my goals.” Gab is still operating, of course, and hoping to succeed where past efforts have not. For years, as tech companies have grappled with whether and how to curtail extremism and disinformation on their platforms, voices on the right have criticized their efforts as censorship, and vowed to create platforms where they can operate without worrying about getting banned. While unlikely to put Twitter or YouTube out of business, sites like Gab and Real.Video seem poised to fulfill that promise and profit from that sentiment — helped by the purge of Jones. “Gab, I’m new to this platform because of the Alex Jones banning,” read one of dozens of messages from new users this week. “I’m a huge trump supporter and love my country, the USA.” © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/gab-com-fights-stay-online-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-035522714--finance.html---split---By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc, Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. "We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar," a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that "promotes and encourages violence against people." The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps Jewish refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill "my people." "Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors," the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, "FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN." Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the "free speech" alternative to Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab's former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive "guilt by association" and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. "We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention," he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of "direct collusion between big tech giants." It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when "a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance." Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. "The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place," he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab's forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, "You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue." Another posted, "I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING." Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab's accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple Inc's mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook's archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc as of Saturday, according to those companies' ad transparency databases. Gab's account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab's presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-respond-hate-love-apos-211605359.html---split---As Pittsburgh continues to reel from a tragic weekend, a Muslim-led effort has begun a crowdfunded campaign to raise money for the victims of Saturday’s synagogue shooting. Posted on LaunchGood, a Muslim-focused crowdfunding site, the effort aims to help support the short-term needs of victims and their families by raising money for medical bills, funeral costs and other expenses after a gunman stormed services at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, killing 11 and wounding 6 before being captured by police. The charity drive has already been a success, with organizers claiming to have raised an average of $2,000 per hour since launching the effort on Saturday. Within six hours, the campaign had already reached its initial goal of $25,000. In less than 24 hours, it had broken $50,000. Two Muslim-led nonprofits, CelebrateMercy and MPower Change, organized the fundraising drive in partnership with the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh and the Tree of Life Synagogue, which will work together to distribute the funds to victims and their families. Tarek El-Messidi, the founding director of CelebrateMercy, says the effort is part of his group’s larger belief in responding to hatred with acts of goodness. “We recognize that the money can’t bring back loved ones that [families] have lost so tragically, nor can it physically heal any of the wounds,” El-Messidi told TIME. “But we do hope the money can in some way lift their spirits, lift the burdens of funeral expenses and medical costs.” For those Pittsburgh Muslims closer to the tragedy, the effort is also simply about helping neighbors and rebuilding their community. “Those who were stolen from us by this hateful person were like family,” says Wasi Mohamed, the Executive Director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh and Emgage Pennsylvania, a nonprofit Muslim advocacy organization. “We feel obligated to follow this Prophetic tradition on standing up for the Jewish community.” “The Pittsburgh Muslim Community extends our deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and all of our Jewish brothers and sisters,” the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh said in a statement. “We condemn this hate crime unequivocally, and denounce all forms of hatred and bigotry. The Pittsburgh community is our family; what happens to one of us, is felt by us all.” Mohamed added that local Muslims have also pledged to support the Jewish community in non-monetary ways during this difficult period, offering trips to the grocery store, protection during services or help with other needs. For El-Messidi, the past few years have not been an easy time to be an American Muslim, which is all the more reason to reach out to others in their times of need. “For one community that’s feeling threatened to reach out to another community that’s also feeling threatened… hopefully it will inspire other people around the country and around the world to engage in similar action,” he said. This latest fundraiser is only the latest of CelebrateMercy’s outreach efforts, which they say are inspired by the teachings and life of the Prophet Mohamed. Following the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, the group organized a campaign for Muslims from around the world to write condolence letters to the family of slain Ambassador Chris Stevens. In the end, they helped send 7,700 letters from Muslims in 115 countries. The group has also raised hundred of thousands of dollars to benefit the San Bernardino shooting victims in 2015, and to repair vandalized Jewish cemeteries in St. Louis and Philadelphia in 2017. “If there’s a silver lining related to this tragedy, it’s that [the Muslim and Jewish] communities that have not worked that closely together are starting a dialogue,” says El-Messidi. “For the first time they’re able to put aside… geopolitics or international politics and really work together for a human cause.”

---split---2.0---split---https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kentucky-shooting/kentucky-supermarket-shooting-investigated-as-hate-crime-idUSKCN1N02W2---split---3 Min Read (Reuters) - The shooting of a black man and woman at a Kentucky supermarket was being investigated as a possible hate crime, a federal prosecutor said on Friday. Gregory Bush, 51, a white man, has been charged with shooting Maurice Stallard, 69, in front of his grandson as they shopped in a Kroger Inc grocery store in Jeffersontown, some 15 miles (24 km) from downtown Louisville. According to an arrest citation, he then went to the parking lot and shot Vickie Jones, 67. Bush has been charged with murder and 10 counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. “Federal investigators are supporting local law enforcement and examining this matter from the perspective of federal criminal law, which includes potential civil rights violations such as hate crimes,” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman said in a statement on Friday. An armed bystander with a carry permit for a concealed weapon exchanged gunfire with Bush in the parking lot before the suspect fled in his car. He was apprehended shortly afterwards, police said. Ed Harrell told the Louisville Courier Journal that he pulled out his pistol as Bush approached him in the parking lot and Bush told him not to shoot as “whites don’t kill whites.” It was not immediately clear if Bush had legal representation. If investigators suspect the killings were racially motivated, Bush could also be charged for a hate crime. Both Stallard and Jones were shot from behind multiple times, Jeffersontown Police Chief Sam Rogers told reporters on Thursday. Rogers said Bush suffered from mental illness and court records showed he had a history of violence and at least one instance when he used a racial slur. About 15 minutes before walking into the Kroger supermarket Bush tried to get into a predominantly black Baptist church, police said, citing surveillance video. First Baptist Church administrator Billy Williams told local CBS affiliate WLKY there were eight to 10 people in the church at the time. In 2015, self-described white supremacist Dylann Roof, then 21, shot and killed nine black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

---split---2.0---split---http://time.com/4143416/san-bernardino-shooting-muslims-donald-trump-fundraising/---split---Hundreds of Muslim-Americans have raised more than $150,000 for the families of the victims killed in the San Bernardino shooting, hoping to respond to “evil with good.” Donations have been pouring in to an online fundraising page called “Muslims United for San Bernardino,” organizers said. The LaunchGood page was created Dec. 3 to ease the financial burden on grieving families after a married Muslim couple gunned down 14 people and injured 21 others in California last week. “It’s literally been collecting over $1,000 per hour since it became a national campaign,” Tarek El-Messidi, the fundraiser’s director, told TIME on Wednesday. El-Messidi is also the founder of CelebrateMercy, a nonprofit that teaches about Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. “This is exactly what we need,” he added. “This channels all of our frustration, all of our anxiety, all of our fear into a constructive act of kindness.”  El-Messidi, 35, said many Muslims felt helpless after the deadly Paris attacks in November and again as the California shooting unfolded. El-Messidi braced himself for the anti-Muslim backlash that he knew would follow. “When Paris happened, I said, ‘God, what if this happens on American soil?’ And then it happened,” he said. “The first thought in every Muslim’s head was, ‘God, please don’t let this be a Muslim.’” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sparked outrage this week when he called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. until officials “can figure out what the hell is going on.” While some world leaders condemned the real estate mogul for the idea, the proposed ban had support from some of Trump’s followers. “I felt like this is the perfect storm,” El-Messidi. “With all the anti-Muslim rhetoric in this election year, and with the Paris attacks, and then this California one, Muslims are just being punched left and right. Your every day Muslim feels like a punching bag.” The fundraising page had collected more than $152,000 as of Wednesday afternoon., with nearly all donations coming from American Muslims, El-Messidi said. “We’re tired of being grouped together with extremists and people who commit these monstrous acts,” said El-Messidi, a former logistics manager in Tennessee. “We wanted to show that American-Muslims are active contributors to society and that we want to build what the extremists are trying to destroy,” he added. The donation page exceeded its $140,000 goal Wednesday, thanks to a $15,000 gift from Meraj Mohiuddin, a 38-year-old trauma anesthesiologist in Phoenix, Arizona. “I saw that they hadn’t met their goal yet. This is too important,” said Mohiuddin. “It’s really all about helping your neighbors here. What we can do as Muslims is be that much more graceful and better versions of ourselves.”

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pittsburgh-rabbi-20181028-story.html#nt=related-content---split---The rabbi didn’t quite know how he was going to do it — though he knew he would have to find a way. Funerals for seven people he knew and loved. Tuesday would be the first: two brothers. He didn’t yet know when the last service would be. “I’ve never had this happen, so ...” his voice trailed off. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers stood on the wet path outside the Soldiers and Sailors Hall Sunday night in Pittsburgh. It had just finished raining. The awfulness of what had happened at his synagogue had sunk in again. His spoke softly. “This is a sort of different experience for any kind of clergy person to have to do something like this,” Myers said. Cecil and David Rosenthal’s funeral would be first. The two brothers, 59 and 54 years old, were among the 11 shooting victims killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday. The youngest victim was David Rosenthal. The oldest was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. “They were good, sweet people,” Myers said. “Not a bad bone in their bodies.” Myers had just spoken at a vigil so large, hundreds of people stood outside in the rain to honor the dead. Afterward, the rabbi was being tugged in several different directions. A television news reporter had him recount the moments during the shooting. He did. “This is just another example of hate in our country,” he told the reporter. A woman, crying, got a hug from him. There were handshakes. Lots of handshakes. He told a person he’d just met that he would be up early Monday morning — like always. He had a lot of work to do. But for a few moments, he stood alone out in the dark awaiting another television interview. It wasn’t his first time in the news. In July, he had lamented the “dizzying pace” of the nation’s 24-hour news cycle that included a heavy dose of violence in a blog post titled “We Deserve Better.” The post got plenty of attention. “Despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that it would fade away in time,” Myers wrote. “Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the midterm elections, I fear that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume. I shouldn’t have to include in my daily morning prayers that God should watch over my wife and daughter, both teachers, and keep them safe. Where are our leaders?” Myers came to Pittsburgh last year to lead the Tree of Life congregation, which is the Conservative synagogue in Squirrel Hill. The Rutgers University graduate holds a master’s degree in Jewish education from the Jewish Theological Seminary, according to his bio on the synagogue’s website. Rodef Shalom Synagogue Rabbi Aaron Bisno remembered meeting him for the first time. They became friends easily. “He’s a really good soul and I think he feels things deeply,” Bisno said. “He’s also burying people that regularly attended Shabbat. These are people who are friends and the loss is deep and painful.” The loss hurt, Myers said. It was personally painful. Myers said the two brothers were “the unofficial welcomers” at the synagogue. His eyes got moist as he talked about them outside the Soldiers and Sailors Hall. He managed a small smile when it was asked if the brothers had similar personalities, noting, “They were brothers, so they were different too.” His voice cracked a little. “They loved everybody and everybody loved them,” Myers said. Bisno said he’d never faced a challenge like the one Myers had in front of him. The services for the brothers were going to be held at Rodef Shalom and were scheduled for noon. Bisno cited a Hebrew idiom to make the point: “It asks, ‘Mah la’sot?’ And the answer is ‘La'asot.’ The translation is, ‘‘What are you going to do?’ The answer is to do it. There is no other option. And he will.” Myers said he will rely on his faith. “How do you prepare?” he asked. “I hope that God gives me divine inspiration to figure that answer out. There is no written process — there can’t be — because this isn’t supposed to happen.”
---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-rio-brazil-olympics_us_5786f996e4b08608d332f81f---split---As protests continue throughout the country over the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, the latest African-American men to die at the hands of police, a coalition of Black Lives Matter activists will take their movement to a new place next week: Rio de Janeiro. It’s the latest effort to expand the Black Lives Matter message across the globe, and it comes at an important time. With less than a month to go before Rio hosts the 2016 Olympic Games, the activists hope they can take advantage of the spectacle to highlight the city’s rising levels of police violence and connect with Brazilian activists who are fighting a similar struggle. “Police brutality is global. And Brazil has its own form of ruthlessness,” Daunasia Yancey, the founder of Black Lives Matter’s Boston chapter, told The Huffington Post. “The movement that came before and during and after Ferguson has been really intentional about a global struggle and understanding that our freedoms are all tied to each other.” Yancey, one of the organizers who met with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in October, is part of a coalition of activists that plans to meet with organizations fighting police violence in Rio. The group will also include Rev. John L. Selders Jr. and Pamela Selders, who together led Moral Monday protests against police violence in Connecticut, and other activists who have worked with the Black Lives Matter movement. Their trip to Rio is the work of Elizabeth Martin, the founder of Brazil Police Watch, a Boston-based organization that has sought to draw American attention to police brutality issues in Brazil. Martin formed the organization after Rio police shot and killed her nephew in 2007. She has since organized petition drives that call on the International Olympic Committee and soccer governing body FIFA to work with the Brazilian government to reduce the number of police killings in the country. Last week, Sterling and Castile became the 122nd and 123rd African-American men shot and killed by police officers in the U.S. this year, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. Police also shot and killed 258 black men in 2015, the Post found. A similar survey from The Guardian found that African-American men are nine times more likely to die at the hands of police than members of any other demographic group. But the Black Lives Matter activists who travel to Brazil this month will encounter a comparable and perhaps even more widespread problem in Rio. Brazil is home to some of the world’s deadliest police forces, and escalating violence in the years before the Olympics has only worsened the situation. Police in Rio de Janeiro state have killed more than 2,500 people since the International Olympic Committee chose Rio as the 2016 host in 2009, according to Amnesty International. Police-related shooting deaths increased 40 percent in the state from 2013 to 2014, the year Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup, according to Amnesty’s numbers. They rose yet again in 2015, when police in the state killed 645 people. Seventy-nine percent of the victims of police killings in Rio state between 2010 and 2014 were black men, and 75 percent were between the ages of 15 and 30, according to Amnesty’s figures. More than half of Brazilians claim African heritage, with 7.6 identifying as black and 43.1 as mixed race. “We’re about all black lives,” Yancey said. “For no police violence, for no state murders, of anyone under any circumstance.” ‘They’re killing for you.’ Violence in Rio has recently escalated amid government efforts to regain control of many of the city’s favelas ― the low-income and long-neglected neighborhoods that dot Rio’s landscape and are sometimes controlled by drug gangs. The program, launched just before Rio learned it would become the host of the 2016 Olympics, established Pacifying Police Units ― or UPPs, their acronym in Portuguese ― in neighborhoods like Rocinha, the city’s largest favela. The takeovers often led to violent military and police occupations of many favelas. And though the “pacification” process was initially supposed to include programs that brought basic social services to neighborhoods that had long lacked them, Brazil’s ongoing economic crisis and other factors have gutted the social elements of the UPP program, often leaving occupation and violent interactions with police as their most visible legacy. “The youth don’t walk around here anymore because they know they will be harassed [by the police] anywhere they go,” said Monique Cruz, a resident of Manguinhos favela, where a UPP was installed in 2013, according to news site RioOnWatch.org. “If there are boys who, by some chance, have a police record, they are already stalked by the police and are always accused of committing crimes, besides being black and young.” Black children have overwhelmingly been the victims of the escalation of violence between police and local gangs. A black Brazilian child is the victim of homicide every 23 minutes, according to figures commonly cited by activists, and the number of children and adolescents murdered in Brazil ― the majority of them black ― has doubled in the last 20 years, UNICEF reported last summer. Those deaths are not all the result of police killings. But police were responsible for 1 in 5 homicides in the city of Rio in 2015, according to Human Rights Watch. In October, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child directly linked Rio’s military police to an “elevated number of summary executions of children.” The motivation, the UN body alleged, was an effort to “clean the streets” of street children in order to “present a problem-free city to the world” during the Olympics. Local organizations and activists held protests in Rio last week to remember and draw attention to some of the children who were recently killed. One demonstration dramatically re-enacted the 2015 deaths of five black and mixed-race youths, all between the ages of 16 and 25, who were driving home from a party in Rio’s Morro da Lagartixa neighborhood when police sprayed their car with up to 30 shots (four police officers were arrested, three of them charged with murder). Protestors stage a performance to demonstrate how the five Costa Barros youth were executed, spraying fake blood. pic.twitter.com/zUQ1iIfp5v Another recalled the shooting of Eduardo de Jesus, a 10-year-old boy killed by police while he sat on his front stoop in the Complexo do Alemão favela in April 2015. Mother of Eduardo de Jesus, 10, shot in the head sitting at the doorstep of his house in Complexo do Alemão in 2015 pic.twitter.com/RJ5UtMZVBF But those demonstrations were overshadowed by a group of Rio police officers who staged their own protest in the city’s main airport. The officers, angry that Rio state’s crunched budget has left them unpaid for weeks, stood behind a sign that welcomed incoming travelers with the message, “Welcome to hell!” Another noted that 52 police officers had died in shootouts this year. The message was clear. A month before hundreds of thousands of international tourists would swarm Rio, police officers in one of the world’s most violent cities were warning them: “Whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe.” The security concerns are real. Olympic athletes have been assaulted. Attacks on public buses have increased. In Rio’s North Zone last weekend, angry crowds stormed the streets and stole cars. But activists, human rights groups and security experts worry that the segment of Rio’s population most vulnerable to police crackdowns has been left out of the “security for all” mantra that once defined the city’s regeneration efforts. "The police have confused everything - cellphones and popcorn for guns. They haven't confused one thing: black is black and white is white." Activists like Martin and Yancey see similarities in the attitudes that underlie police brutality in Brazil and the United States. In the name of overall public safety, police in both countries have disproportionately targeted a group of people that they, and society as whole, have deemed undesirable and a threat to that security. And those people ― primarily black, many of them poor and thus easily written off as gangsters, thugs, “bandidos” ― in turn become less safe. “The notion is that the police are keeping people safe,” Martin said. “Well, which people? And safe from who?” Martin wants Rio’s Olympic tourists, especially those from a nation in the midst of its own conversations about police killings, to understand that Rio’s desire to ensure their security has an ugly cost. “If the police are cleaning up ― if they’re killing people ― so that you can go to the Olympics, they’re killing on your behalf,” Martin said. “They’re killing for you, so you can be a spectator at the Olympics.” ‘Everywhere the Olympics goes, state terror follows.’ Facing protests from community organizations and scrutiny from human rights groups, Brazil’s federal and state governments have instituted some reforms to reduce the number of police killings and tackle what human rights groups have called a “culture of impunity” for law enforcement officers who use lethal force. Brazil has increased community policing training, installed cameras on law enforcement vehicles and reduced the use of rifles. Sao Paulo state, which will host Olympic soccer matches, passed laws prohibiting police from driving injured individuals to the hospital so officers would not interfere with a crime scene or even murder the person in transit to cover up a crime. Rio state officials say the number of police-related killings has declined over the last decade, though many admit that there is still work to do. “We need much more training to prepare the police for territories where we still have a lot of difficulty working,” Col. Robson Rodrigues, a retired member of the Rio state police, told The New York Times last year. “Policing activities still need some correcting.” But if the number of police killings in Rio and across Brazil are any indication, reform efforts thus far have fallen short. “This is not a problem that is ignored in Brazil,” said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “It’s just very, very hard to tackle, as the recent and recurring experience in the United States is highlighting.” The Olympics may only make it harder, leaving behind a legacy of violent “pacification” efforts once the three-week party ends and tourists go home. In Rio, 85,000 members of the police and military will be tasked with securing the city during the Olympic Games, and the government has invested heavily in new surveillance and security infrastructure to help. This could all be useful for protecting tourists and athletes. But it might also have demonstrably negative effects on Rio’s poorest residents, who already endure the most scrutiny from law enforcement, especially because that infrastructure tends to remain in place once the Olympics end. “I come to ask that the Olympics do not leave a legacy of tears and blood. But rights and a dignified life,” said Rio resident Ana Paula Oliveira, whose 19-year-old son was killed by police in 2014. Oliveira spoke at an event organized by Amnesty and other human rights organizations to denounce the violence, according to Brazilian news outlet Estadão. “The middle-class and upper-middle-class people will continue to live behind security enclaves that they can afford,” said Kim Schimmel, a Kent State University professor and expert in the security legacies of major sporting events. “The poorer people will be even more at risk.” Yancey shares these worries. She and Boston’s Black Lives Matter chapter organized their own Olympic protests in 2015, when Boston launched a bid to host the 2024 Games. The Olympics could only worsen the problems the city’s black residents are facing, they argued, particularly their relationship with law enforcement. “Everywhere the Olympics goes, state terror follows,” Yancey told HuffPost. It is possible, too, that the Olympics could further limit Brazilians’ ability to demonstrate against such violence. Law enforcement officials violently cracked down on protests across Brazil before the 2014 World Cup, including demonstrations over the disappearance of Amarildo de Souza, a Rio man whose death at the hands of police later led to the arrest of 10 officers. But police could have even more power during the Olympics, thanks to new laws passed by Brazil’s federal legislature in 2015: an “anti-terrorism” bill that activists believe could be used to criminalize public gatherings, and a “General Law of the Olympics” ― essentially required by the IOC ― that Amnesty says puts rights of public assembly and expression even further at risk. Human rights groups’ fears about a lasting reduction of basic rights “are pretty well-founded,” said Pete Fussey, a criminologist at London’s University of Essex who has closely examined the security legacies of that city’s 2012 Olympics. “If you look at the history of Olympic security, that’s pretty much exactly what happens.” “It’s difficult to know what [policies] will remain in place,” Fussey said, “but I think it will increase impunity, reduce accountability and foster an acceptability of an exceptional level of security.” ”There isn’t much one can say right now that’s positive, other than, like in the United States, you have people confronting the issue,” Sotero said. “I hope people use the opportunity of the Olympics to highlight the problem.” That is exactly what the group of activists heading to Rio next week plan to do. Their trip will end on July 23, the 24th anniversary of the Candelaria massacre ― a mass execution of Rio street children that is one of the worst incidents of police violence in Brazilian history. The Olympics will begin in Rio just 13 days later. “This is about the globalization of police brutality,” Martin said. “There’s a job we have as citizens of the world to pay attention to this.” For more Olympic coverage: Meet The Badass 16-Year-Old Boricua Repping The U.S. At The Olympics Here Are The 5 Superhumans Who Just Made The U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Team Meet Simone Biles, America’s New Gymspiration

The streets were empty, as usual, but inside the nicely kept brick houses of this well-to-do neighbourhood, the centre of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, residents faced the inevitable question - do I know anyone? Many probably did, or at least knew someone who did. "You wouldn't expect it," said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lives just a few houses from the Tree of Life Congregation, where the deadly shooting took place. "It's very shocking because the neighbourhood is so loving and calm." More than a quarter of Pittsburgh's 50,000 Jewish adults and children live in Squirrel Hill, according to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania. Several temples from different Jewish denominations, kosher restaurants and local shops form what has been called a "vibrant oasis" of Judaism in the city. And so, when a gunman opened fire at a local synagogue, many felt that not only their religion was being attacked, but their own little haven. "It's a tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone," said Adam Hertzman, the federation's marketing director. "The whole Jewish community is shocked, [but] Jewish Pittsburgh is so close together, like a family, it will not change that." The attack - the darkest day of Pittsburgh's history, according to Mayor Bill Peduto - happened as worshippers gathered in a drizzly morning in different rooms at the congregation, home to three different synagogues. The larger one, Tree of Life, was set up in 1864. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, stormed the building and shot indiscriminately. During the attack, he reportedly shouted "All Jews must die". "I always knew there were people who hated Jewish people," said 16-year-old student Spencer Lieberman, who avoids wearing Jewish symbols in public, including his necklace with the Star of David. "But I never imagined anyone would do something like this." Eleven people, whose ages ranged from 54 to 97, were killed in the attack, including a couple and two brothers. Six others were injured, including four police officers who engaged in a gun battle with the suspect, and two members of the congregation. But for many in Squirrel Hill, and probably across the country, this is more than just tragedy coming to a small, close community. The attack happened amid a perceived rise in hate-related crimes nationwide and at the end of a particularly tense week in which more than a dozen explosive devices were sent to critics of President Donald Trump. Some have blamed the president himself for stirring divisions, claims he denies. He called the attack a "wicked act of mass murder". Mr Hertzman, who used to worship at the synagogue attacked and knew two of the dead, said: "We've certainly seen that anti-Semitism is on the rise across the US. I don't know if it's increased in Pittsburgh or we're just more aware of that." The gunman had posted anti-Semitic content on social network Gab under the username "onedingo", and the bio on his account, now suspended, read: "Jews are the children of Satan". Hours before attacking the synagogue on International Religious Freedom Day, he criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and said he could not "sit by and watch my people get slaughtered". "This shouldn't be happening," said 54-year-old resident Dan Berger. "Divisions have been big in the country. We should all be Americans and all these differences are dividing our country." Mr Bowers faces 29 criminal charges, including obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs, a hate crime, and using a firearm to commit murder. All of these can carry the death penalty. Throughout Sunday, dozens of residents and others brought flowers and candles to Tree of Life's entrance. They were adamant that the attack would not change this place. "[The attacker] was an anti-Semitic man but he seemed to be a hateful man," said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. "Hate is hate, is terrible and it doesn't have any place in our country, city or Squirrel Hill." Ms Butler's family of Orthodox Jews only found out about the shooting in the evening, as they do not use any electronic device, she said. They carried placards thanking the police for keeping "the Jews in [their] neighbourhood safe". "You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole," she said. "This has touched all of us." The Boeing 737, carrying 189 people, vanished shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital. 15 sayings from around the world

Brady says he has begun the process to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ approval as required by law to pursue a capital case against Bowers. Brady says multiple search warrants have been issued in the investigation of Bowers, a long-haul trucker who worked as an independent contractor. Police responding to the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue wounded Bowers and arrested him. Eight men and three women were killed when Bowers opened fire. The FBI said he was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns. Bowers is scheduled to appear in court early Monday afternoon for a hearing.

Officials said they believed the suspected shooter, Robert Bowers, 46, who has been indicted with dozens of charges including 11 counts of murder, was working alone when he allegedly entered the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday morning, armed with three hand guns and a semi-automatic rifle. Eight men and three women were killed in the deadliest ever attack on the Jewish community in the US, before police officers shot the suspect and took him into custody. The FBI said they were treating the 20-minute incident as “a hate crime”, while Mayor Bill Peduto called it the “darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history”. “We should be working to eliminate irrational behaviour and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing,” he said. But less than two weeks before the midterm elections, and with the country already on edge after more than a dozen suspected pipe bombs were sent to senior Democrats and critics of Mr Trump, the president was accused of failing to try and unite the nation at such an unsettling time. Rather, he was charged with making things worse. Following Saturday morning’s shooting at the synagogue, Mr Trump condemned the act of violence as an “antisemitic act” and “pure evil”. “There must be no tolerance for antisemitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice,” he added. Critics said the president’s language, frequently aggressive and mocking of people who disagreed with him, was helping to create an environment in which such acts were more likely. “This president’s modus operandi is to divide us,” Democratic congressman Adam Schiff told CNN. “It’s not enough that a day on a tragedy he says the right words, if every other day of the year he’s saying things to bring us into conflict with one another.” Supporters of the president, who on Friday had denied his words or actions had inspired accused mail bomber Cesar Sayoc, were quick to dismiss any link between Mr Trump’s language and the gun attack in Pittsburgh, whose alleged perpetrator reportedly wrote disparaging comments about the president on social media and said he was a “globalist, not a nationalist”. The word globalist is often used as a slur by antisemites. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, told Fox News the president “has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow political violence to take root in this country”. Meanwhile, the vice president Mike Pence rejected the notion that confrontational rhetoric by Mr Trump other leaders had created a spike in political violence. “People on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences, but I just don’t think you can connect it to threats or acts of violence,” he told NBC. In Pittsburgh, officials revealed several new details about the attack said to have been carried out by Mr Bowers, saying he was armed with three hand guns and a semi-automatic rifle. Victims were found in three different locations inside the synagogue in the Squirrel Hill area of the city. In addition to the 11 fatalities, six other people were injured, including four police officers. Dr Karl Williams, the chief medical examiner of Allegheny County, which includes the Pennsylvania city of Pittsburgh, revealed that the victims included a husband and wife, and two brothers. He said four rabbis from the synagogue had been working with his team, as they informed the victims’ families before they were named publicly. Mr Williams named the victims as Joyce Fienberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, Cecil Rosenthal, 59, David Rosenthal, 54, Bernice Simon, 84, Sylvan Simon, 87, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and 69-year-old Irving Younger. All lived close to the synagogue. During a press conference on Sunday morning, FBI agent Robert Jones praised the police officers who responded to the incident and engaged in a shoot out to stop the gunman, who was shot and injured and taken into custody. “Had he made it out of that facility, there is a strong possibility that additional violence would have occurred,” he said. When pressed on that issue, Mr Jones said there was no evidence that the alleged shooter planned to attack another location, but that there would have likely been more shooting as he left the synagogue, had he been able to. The US attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady said there was no indication yet why the gunman had selected that particular facility. It was also not clear which of the three congregations that were using the synagogue for services on Saturday was the intended target – if indeed any specific group was. While officials said they were still investigating the specific motivations for the attack, charge sheets made public on Sunday alleged Mr Bower expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and told officers afterwards that Jews were committing genocide and he wanted them all to die. Mr Williams, the medical examiner, said: “Lots of shots were fired. There were casings everywhere.” The authorities said they found victims at three different locations in the building. Mr Bowers was found by police on the third floor. Mayor Bill Peduto called it the “darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history”. Asked if it was time for politicians in the US to finally do something to better regulate access to firearms, Mr Peduto said: “We’re dealing with irrational behaviour. There is no way that you can rationalise a person walking into a synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people. “We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimise the dangers that occur from irrational behaviour. We should be working to eliminate irrational behaviour and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing.” Mr Brady, the prosecutor, explained why the incident was being handled as a hate crime rather than domestic terrorism. “The distinction between a hate crime and domestic terrorism is a hate crime is where an individual is animated by a hatred or certain animus towards a person of a certain ethnicity or religious faith,” he said. “It becomes domestic terrorism where there’s an ideology that that person is then also trying to propagate through violence. We continue to see where that line is. But for now, at this place in our investigation, we’re treating it as a hate crime and charging it as such.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/twitter-melts-down-trump-says-040537829.html---split---Gun control “had little to do” with the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday that killed 11 people, President Donald Trump insisted. But the death toll would have been much lower had the synagogue hired an armed guard, he claimed. Twitter imploded. If the Tree of Life synagogue had an “armed guard inside ... they would have been able to stop them,” Trump told reporters. “Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him,” he added, referring to suspected gunman Robert Bowers. The gunman was armed with an assault rifle and handguns, according to police. Twitter responses slammed Trump for blaming the synagogue for failing to have a guard, and pointed out that four of the six people wounded in the attack were police officers, all armed. They scorched him for his outright refusal to consider how gun laws affect gun violence in America, and for his apparent aim to put even more firearms in people’s hands. But what drove Twitter users particularly bonkers was the idea of armed guards in places of worship. Trump says Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh has “little to do with” gun laws, says the synagogue should have “had some kind of a protection” inside the temple, and later blames synagogue for not having armed guards. pic.twitter.com/AWg5AwkEKp And he never mentioned the victims... Yeah, I'm sure that's the message the churches want to communicate.. pic.twitter.com/8noo57AQAA Yes...bc you of course want guns at a bris. Rabbis with rifles. That's the answer And why stop there. Pastors with pistols. Kids with carbines. Oldies with oozies I would rather place restrictions on who can buy the weapons of war than live in a country where we have to arm teachers and rabbis. Oh yes. So it's the victims' fault yet again. Armed trained police were shot. I’m sure guards would have done so much better. @POTUS@RealDonaldTrump The police were located right around the corner, arrived in one minute, and three of them were shot. The problem is that the killer had an #AssaultWeapon. That's why he killed 11 people before armed police could stop him. #BanAssaultWeapons! Be #ProLife Somebody needs to tell our NRA-bought president that there were armed guards at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Pulse, the high schools in Parkland and Santa Fe, etc. A deranged civilian w/an AR-15 and a death wish will always overpower security guards. What we need is #GunControlNow. @POTUS Really? The guy had an AR-15 style war weapon. What good would a guard at the door done? This is most assuredly a gun issue. How did the guy get a weapon of war? That’s what he wants America to become. Everywhere you go, schools, work, grocery store, place of worship will have armed guards. #NotInMyAmerica Dystopia. I want less guns. I blame the shooter and anyone who defends having more guns. ANOTHER mass murder event with an AR-15 used. This weapon could be moved to Class 3 weapon status TODAY and would be off store shelves TOMORROW. It could be done with a simple written directive to BATFE to classify the AR-15 as a "Destructive Device" which it obviously is. After getting $30 million from the NRA, Trump will advocate more guns for everyone, probably schoolkids too. My sister lives near there. She had to abandon her car when this happened. She was impressed by the quick action of the police & others. She was horrified by the words of @realDonaldTrump . She says the area is “ a war zone.”

This is the Indian limited overs vice-captain’s second century of the series and second against the West Indies. He continues to be fourth on... It was once again a masterclass from Rohit Sharma as he scored a brilliant century to guide India to a big total in the fourth ODI encounter against West Indies in Mumbai on Monday. The India opener looked quite comfortable against the West Indies bowlers as he slammed 162 off just 137 balls with the help of 20 fours and four sixes. When it comes to the Indian batsmen with most sixes in ODIs, Rohit surpassed Sachin Tendulkar to clinch the second spot with 198 sixes. Former skipper MS Dhoni is only batsman ahead of Rohit in the list with 211 sixes. This was also the seventh 150+ score for Ro... Indonesia’s disaster agency says a Lion Air passenger jet crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta and was carrying 188 passengers and crew. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the aircraft, on a 1 hour and 10 minute flight to Pangkal Pinang on an island chain off Sumatra, was carrying 189 passengers, including one child and two babies, and eight crew members.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Japan to attend the 13th India-Japan annual summit. On Sunday, Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe held informal talks at a resort near Mount Fuji and visited a factory of industrial robot manufacturer on Sunday as they spent about eight hours together on the first day of a two-day summit. PM Modi has said the partnership between the two countries has been fundamentally transformed and it has been strengthened as a ‘special strategic and global partnership’. Here are the live updates: All 189 passenger and crew aboard a crashed Indonesian jet were “likely” killed in the accident, Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said Monday, as it announced it had found human remains. “My prediction is that nobody survived because the victims that we found, their bodies were no longer intact and it’s been hours so it is likely 189 people have died,” agency operational director Bambang Suryo Aji told reporters.

As Bihar’s new chief minister in 2005, Nitish Kumar was like a breath of fresh air in the state’s rambunctious politics. He promised to go beyond the politics of identity by making the discourse more inclusive. He was all about good governance, and, within a short span of time, he did bring about a keen sense of real governance to a state which, for all practical purposes, had seen little of that since the 1990s. But that promise of better things to come lies in tatters today. The Supreme Court’s (SC) Thursday order to move the main accused in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case outside the s...

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/while-hateful-online-neighbors-say-synagogue-attack-suspect-showed-no-n925281---split---The gunman who allegedly opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue where Sabbath services were taking place on Saturday morning, killing 11 people, left a trail of anti-Semitic posts online, but neighbors said he gave no outward indication of his deadly plans. The attack at the Tree of Life synagogue began sometime before 9:54 a.m., when police were called about an active shooter inside the house of worship in the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which is considered to be a historic Jewish enclave and center for Jewish life in Pittsburgh. Officials said the suspect, identified by authorities and law enforcement sources as Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin, Pennsylvania, was armed with an assault rifle and at least three handguns. The FBI said it appears he entered the house of worship and opened fire and then was confronted by police as he tried to leave. He allegedly shot at police officers in two confrontations as he was exiting the building and then inside and was himself shot multiple times, officials said. Four officers were injured. One officer and another person who was shot were described as being in critical condition. Neighbors said Bowers lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment in a complex called McAnulty Acres, and there was nothing particularly unusual about him. "He was always very quiet. I would very seldom see him," said one 59-year-old neighbor who asked that her name not be used. "He would come and throw the trash away and I would just say hello and that was it." "It's just insane. Who knows what else he was planning?" she added. "I'm in a fog." But online, social media accounts that appear to belong to Bowers contained posts with anti-Semitic messages and hate speech. He apparently made repeated threats to Jews, posted conspiracy theories and made a specific threat against Jews hours before allegedly conducting the attack. Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said that while the investigation is still in its early stages, Bowers did not appear to be known to law enforcement before the shooting. "Certainly, the actions this person took today were hateful," Jones said. "We are in the early stages of this investigation, and over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in this suspect’s life — his home, his vehicle, his social media and his movements over the last several days," Jones said. "I want the people of Pittsburgh to know that the FBI will work around the clock to get them the answers as to why and how this happened," he said. Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the shooting, "and without their courage, this tragedy would have been far worse," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said at a news conference. Scott W. Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, called the attack a “terrible and unspeakable act of hate.” He said it is being investigated as a federal hate crime. Bowers was charged Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, Brady announced. He is also charged with 11 counts of obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and other counts. "The actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity," Brady said Saturday afternoon. "Justice in this case will be swift, and it will be severe," he said. In Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday evening, a crowd estimated to be in the hundreds attended a vigil for the victims amid rainy weather, some holding candles. One person held a sign aloft that read "hate & violence are not the answer." The vigil was organized by students at Taylor Allderdice High School. One of the organizers, senior Cody Murphy, told NBC affiliate WPXI of Pittsburgh that "no one in the community should have to be alone right now" and that "the act of one hateful guy is not going to stop us from spreading love and caring." "It shows that we’re not going to let hate drive us apart," Cody said. "... we’re going to stay together and we’re going to remain the strong Pittsburgh community that I know we’ve always been. And we’re going to continue to love each other."

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-promises-drive-anti-004846868.html---split---The mayor of Pittsburgh summoned all the city’s famous industrial grit on Sunday evening as he promised to drive anti-Semites out of the open and back to their basements, following the gun attack that killed 11 Jewish people. Thousands of mourners packed into the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum for an eclectic service that featured gospel songs, psalms, the words of Mr Rogers – the puppeteer and TV star who lived locally – and a speech by Naftali Bennett, the nationalist Israeli government minister. Some in the crowd came to express their grief while others said they had come to show their solidarity. But it was Bill Peduto, the city’s mayor, who captured the defiant mood of thousands more who braved an autumn downpour to stand outside and listen to the service via loudspeakers. “Let me tell you something about Pittsburgh: We’re tough. We are proud of our blue collar roots and we are not the type of people that react to threats or actions in a way that takes back from us,” he said, in an address that referenced how the steel city had bounced back from previous hardships. “We will drive antisemitism and the hate of any people back to the basement, on to computers, and away from open discussion and dialogue around the city, around the state and around this country.” His words triggered a standing ovation and deafening applause. Robert Bowers is due to appear in court on Monday charged with the 11 murders. Police say they are poring over his social media accounts where he is accused of sharing anti-Semitic memes and conspiracy theories. Jeff Finkelstein, chief executive of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, channelled Mr Rogers, the beloved children’s performer who once lived in Squirrel Hill, scene of the shooting. “When you see scary things, look for the helpers,” he said, repeating the entertainer’s gentle catchphrase. “You will always find people who are helping.” Outside, Cindy Bryce huddled beneath an umbrella with her teenaged daughter. The steady rain was not going to put them off, even if there was no more room inside the memorial and museum. “This is what Pittsburgh is about,” she said, gesturing at the crowds crammed on the steps beneath the building’s neo-classical facade. Red Cross volunteer criss-crossed the crowd giving out water or offering counselling services. Inside, the rabbi of the New Light congregation, and the man credited with shepherding some of the congregants behind a door and saving their lives during Saturday's shooting, described losing pillars of the community who would volunteer not just at the synagogue but in the wider society. His voice cracking with emotion, Jonathan Perlman said: “What happened yesterday will not break us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together.” Yet for all the talk of rebuilding and of resisting a lone gunman intent on destroying the American commitment to freedom and diversity, there were plenty in the crowd worrying quietly about what the future might bring. America is heading into midterm elections next week during a particularly febrile part of the electoral cycle. Civility is in short supply among politicians and on Friday a suspect was arrested and charged with sending homemade bombs to prominent liberal figures. Carri Golden, who lives a couple of blocks from Squirrel hill, said Sunday felt like the day after 9/11: The enormity of it all made it difficult to process. For her part as a Jew, she wondered if the events at the Tree of Life synagogue were a timely reminder that anti-Semitism remained at large in the world. “I was too comfortable, too secure,” she said, adding that her husband had been verbally abused on his way to and from synagogue. “We have to get good out of the pain, we have to honour the victims by making the world a better place.”

Some analysts characterized the campaign as a battle for the future of democracy in Latin America’s largest economy. Bolsonaro, a combative, far-right populist who praised Brazil’s decades-long military dictatorship, advocated for state-sponsored torture, joked about rape, and proudly showed off his homophobia and sexism, won the election with more than 55% of the vote. Global markets are cheering his victory, with Brazil-tracking funds and trusts in Asia and Europe rising sharpl... Women who need IVF in order to conceive a child are being denied it from as young as 34 in some areas of the UK because of their age, even though government guidelines stipulate that it be available free up until the age of 42. In the UK, fertility treatments including IVF have been available since 2004 through the National Health Service (NHS), a tax-funded institution which ensures critical UK healthcare is free at the point of delivery. But the NHS is massively under-funded, meaning local authorities have had to decide which non life-saving treatments to cut. Guidelines say that women un... It’s too early to speculate what caused Lion Air flight JT610 to crash this morning, shortly after departing from Jakarta, with 189 people on board. But one thing we know is that the aircraft that went down has a lot of the industry’s hopes pinned to it. This Boeing 737 Max 8 had only been in operation for two months, but today marks the first time this relatively new aircraft type has been involved in a crash. The Indonesian domestic low-cost carrier Lion Air has been one of the aircraft’s biggest customers, while Boeing has taken 4,783 orders for the aircraft across the world. Of those or... Snacks and beverages giant PepsiCo has time and again been accused of over-exploiting water resources in India. Bottling plants of the fizzy-drink maker are said to be water guzzlers. Last year, the company, along with rival Coca-Cola, faced public protests in the southern state of Tamil Nadu over the issue. But as consumers across the world become increasingly concerned about what happens from farm to fork, food and beverage (F&B) companies are compelled to enable sustainable agricultural methods. At PepsiCo, Christine Daugherty heads a team tasked with ensuring responsible agriculture sou... It was just in June that Indonesia finally got the all-clear from the European Union, which removed all of the country’s airlines from its safety blacklist. That was supposed to mark a major moment for the country’s booming aviation industry, which had for years suffered from a poor safety record with the EU blacklisting all Indonesian airlines in 2007. The US also barred flights from the country’s airlines that year, but raised Indonesia’s safety rating in 2016. But the crash of a Lion Air flight today (Oct. 29) with 189 people on board has raised the alarm once again over the safety of th... Narendra Modi can certainly be described as Napoleonic in his single-minded pursuit of power and his belief in his own destiny from a very young age. Many of his admirers point to his visionary speeches, his soaring ambition, and his unshakeable faith in his own and India’s destiny as evidence that he has the special qualities that the iconic French leader possessed. However, while Napoleon is remembered, despite all his shortcomings, for his brilliant foresight and his belief in, and implementation of, many of the ideas that are fundamental to the world today—among them religious tolerance... Spin the globe to India and you’ll see it’s lit up like Diwali: the #MeToo movement is rising, and—like its US predecessor—is largely being played out on social media, with very real consequences for well-known public figures. The campaign is not confined to large cities; among the top areas searching the term are small towns across India. This moment has been a long time coming. The public accounts of violence shared by women using the #MeToo hashtag stretch back to memories of growing up, entering the workforce, walking on the streets, using public transport and other settings typically e... India’s young, unmarried, and mobile professionals have long been viewed with suspicion by landlords for their perceived exuberance and brashness. However, this housing nightmares may not last long, given the slew of startups betting on co-living as a solution to young urban Indians’ home rental woes. On Oct. 22, Softbank-funded hospitality startup OYO announced the launch of OYO Living, its new co-living vertical that targets young professionals in four Indian cities. The Gurugram-based company is the newest addition to a growing list of firms joining the co-living segment. Co-living, or c... Indian lawmakers simply don’t want the country’s citizens to watch adult content online. But, well, there’s not much they can do to effectively implement their wishes. On Oct. 27, the Indian government’s telecom department told internet service providers (ISPs) to ban 827 websites for hosting pornographic content. This is at least the second attempt in recent times by India, among the most prolific consumers of porn, to shut it out. In August 2015, following a supreme court verdict, the government had unsuccessfully tried to block some 857 websites on the grounds that such content promotes ... Indonesian authorities confirmed today (Oct. 29) that a Lion Air plane carrying 189 people traveling from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, near the island of Sumatra, has crashed. It is unclear whether there are any survivors on flight JT610. “We hope, we pray, but we cannot confirm,” said Muhmmad Syaugi, head of Indonesia’s search-and-rescue agency at a press conference.

China’s private space industry saw a setback in its development over the weekend after a Chinese rocket firm failed to send a satellite into orbit. The three-stage solid-fueled rocket, developed by Beijing-based private firm LandSpace, took off from the national launching site in Jiuquan in north-central China on Saturday (Oct. 27) around 4pm local time. But “something abnormal happened during the third stage,” according to a post by the firm on social media Weibo (link in Chinese). That happened around seven minutes (link in Chinese) after the rocket took off from the ground. As a result, ... Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing candidate who once said in a newspaper interview that a fellow lawmaker was “too ugly” to rape, has won Brazil’s second-round presidential election. The run-off election on Sunday (Oct. 28) took place after Bolsonaro failed to win an outright majority in polls three weeks ago, leading to the face-off against his closest rival, Fernando Haddad, of the left-wing Workers’ Party. Bolsonaro, a former army captain of the conservative Social Liberal Party, has expressed admiration for Brazil’s past military dictatorship, and says the country needs tough leadership to... If you could only celebrate one holiday, Halloween or Thanksgiving, which would you choose? A new survey finds it depends a lot on your age. The survey firm YouGov recently asked the question of nearly 3,000 people in the US: 76% of Americans chose Thanksgiving, 19% Halloween, and 5% were not sure. But the differences across age groups were stark. While only 9% of people 55 or older chose Halloween, 33% of 35-44 year-olds like the spookier holiday more, the most of any age group. The survey didn’t ask why these younger adults chose Halloween. Perhaps it is the fun of dressing up kids, or fo... For the past six years, as a brutal civil war has reduced swathes of Syria to rubble, no visitors have set foot in the National Museum of Damascus.

The move is a sign that “Damascus has recovered,” Syrian minister of culture Mohamed al-Ahmad told reporters and visitors, according to Associated Press. “The opening of the museum is a genuine message that Syria is still here and her heritage would not be affected by terrorism.” Much of Syria’s rich cultural history has been destroyed during its civil war.

Sometimes it seems like people really suck, to put it bluntly. We struggle with ourselves and others. We don’t handle difficult situations graciously. We’re deceptive, trying to appear generous, nice, and polite to hide mean-spiritedness. And when we aim to please, it’s often out of greed or weakness. But do not despair. There’s a way to discern your own flaws and what makes others monstrous, learn through observation, and turn it all around so that you’re neither awful nor miserable—and neither a pawn in other people’s schemes nor subject to their weaknesses. With this discernment, argues ... One of my favorite anecdotes from a few years back is of the Nairobi Uber driver who asked this New Yorker, “Do they have Uber in the US?” Since then, I’ve encountered many drivers from Lagos to Cape Town and noted how quickly ride-sharing has spread in some of the big African cities, although not without its challenges. It’s also been interesting to see the rapid rise of Airbnb as a much-needed alternative in some of Africa’s largest cities which have a shortage of affordable international standard hotels. Again, what seemed unlikely just a few years earlier has made a notable impact. Uber...

Their refusal comes after the death of the Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey.

US president Donald Trump claims to be surprised that anti-Semitism still exists. “This was an anti-Semitic act,” he said after the shooting that killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age.” Such disbelief, from a man who has long usedanti-Semitic code words to fire up his base, defies credibility. It also reflects a widespread tendency to minimize the hatred that Jewish people face. After neo-Nazis marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, shouting, “Jews will not replace us,” there was an unnerving lac... This week Chinese president Xi Jinping ordered the Southern Theatre Command, responsible for monitoring the South China Sea and Taiwan, to boost its military capabilities to prepare for a possible conflict, according to a Hong Kong newspaper.

Social isolation takes a heavy toll on those who suffer from it, both in health and overall well-being. An effort to quantify the cost of loneliness in the US also found that among Americans aged 65 or older, social isolation costs the US government nearly $7 billion in additional health care costs per year. People of any age can be socially isolated, of course, but the risk of losing contact with friends, family, and community members becomes greater as a person ages. For some in later life, social networks can shrink after losses and life changes: retirement, the death of friends and love... On Oct. 26, US authorities charged Florida resident Cesar Sayoc with sending 13 explosive devices to prominent public figures, including former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. The internet immediately uncovered Sayoc’s social media accounts, which were promptly suspended. Sayoc’s tweets were a hodgepodge of anti-Democrat memes, and included attacks on many of the folks he targeted: Obama, Clinton, billionaire philanthropist George Soros, representativeDebbie Wasserman Schultz, as well as Oprah Winfrey, former NFL starColin Kaepernick, and Parkland shoot...
---split---2.0---split---https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/28/darkest-day-pittsburghs-history-unfolded/---split---The killing took little more than 20 minutes. Eleven people lay dead or dying inside the synagogue as the gunman switched between assault rifle and his three handguns, descending into the basement and back to the first floor. But as he made his way out of the door to leave he was confronted by two armed police officers. He ran back inside and climbed two flights of stairs as the officers gave chase, according to new details of the deadly attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh released by prosecutors on Sunday. Scott Brady, US attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said the death toll could have been much worse if the suspect had left before police arrived. “Without hesitation, without concern for their safety they ran toward gunfire to protect innocent victims,” he said. Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of storming the building during a Sabbath morning service. He is due to appear in court on Monday to face 29 charges – including 11 of counts of murder, which police are treating as a hate crime. Authorities said he wore tactical gear and carried an AR-15 rifle and three Glock 357 handguns into the building at about 9.50am – and used all three, leaving shell casings scattered on the floor. Officials told the AP that Bowers had a licence to carry firearms and legally owned his guns. He was cornered by a Swat team on the third floor after a firefight that wounded four officers and the gunman. Police chatter picked up by a local scanner revealed details of a tense standoff as officers feared he may be wearing an explosive vest. But within minutes the wounded suspect crawled towards police officers to give himself up. “They’re committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews,” he repeatedly told arresting officers, according to the complaint. Bob Jones, the special agent leading the FBI investigation, said he left behind the “the most horrific crime scene” he had seen in 22 years of service. The result is a community in mourning and a city in shock. Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said the Jewish community was the “backbone” of the neighbourhood and the “fabric” of the city. “We will get through this darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history by working together,” he said. The neighbourhood of Squirrel Hill took on an air of quiet mourning on Sunday. Its streets stayed empty apart from dog walkers and the handful of people leaving flowers at a makeshift shrine outside the synagogue. “What’s my country coming to,” asked one local, who asked to remain anonymous so she could speak more freely. “There’s something about the climate now. “Maybe there were always people like this but there’s something allowing them to act out.” The attack came one day after a man was arrested on suspicion of sending bombs in the mail to mostly prominent political figures, mostly Democrats including former President Barack Obama and George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist, ahead of next week’s divisive congressional elections. Cesar Sayoc has been charged with five federal crimes. Video showed his van covered in stickers professing his support for Donald Trump and featured a CNN presenter caught in crosshairs. Investigators told a news conference on Sunday that they would be poring through Bowers’ online life as they build a case against him. He used an account on Gab, a social medial platform popular with white supremacists, to share antisemitic comments and memes. “Jews are the children of Satan,” read his biography. He also spread content about “migrant caravans” moving through Central America, sharing unfounded conspiracy theories that suggested Jews were helping immigrants reach the US. Similar theories are widely shared among Rightwing websites and sometimes name Mr Soros as a key donor. “I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders',” read one post, less than a week before the shooting. “I like this.” The US has seen a sharp upturn in antisemitic attacks during the past two years. Mr Peduto, the mayor, said he had heard President Donald Trump’s comments that the attack might not have happened if the synagogue had armed guards but said it was difficult to protect against irrational behaviour. “I think the approach we need to be looking at how we take the guns – which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America – out of the hands that are looking to express hatred through murder,” he said. He added that he was heartened by the deluge of support he had received from across America and around the world. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh in St Peter's Square. "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence," he said as he prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values."  © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

But as the nation comes to grips with yet another mass murder carried out by an angry man with a deadly weapon, it is perhaps time to review how often Americans turn to guns to express discontent, hate and prejudice against their compatriots. In 2018 alone, including the most recent carnage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, there have been 47,220 gun-related incidents resulting in 11,984 deaths in the United States, according to data compiled by Gun Violence Archive, an independent data-collection and research group. That breaks down to 157 incidents and 40 deaths a day and does not include 22,000 suicides. Of the total fatalities, 548 were children, while 2,321 were teenagers. GVA defines gun incidents as all types of shootings, including officer involved, accidental, children shooting themselves, murders, armed robberies, mass shootings, home Invasions and drivebys. “Only by being totally inclusionary in our definitions is our data accurate, allowing the researcher to decide which parts of the complete dataset they need for their work. Our goal is to provide a complete picture of impact,” said the group in a statement on its website. There are, of course, arguments from staunch gun-rights supporters that an armed citizenry is a safer citizenry. Nothing stops a bad guy with a gun like a good guy with a gun, is a popular National Rifle Association talking point. And President Donald Trump pondered aloud on Saturday whether guns inside the synagogue might have led to a less tragic outcome. President Trump, asked about gun laws, says the Pittsburgh synagogue should have had armed security at the bris and the gunman wouldn’t be able to do what he did pic.twitter.com/y9Cq59wPM5 But among the 2018 shooting incidents, only 1,478 cases, or 3.1% of the total, involved the defensive use of weapons. In Pittsburgh, at least 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue by a suspect shouting, “All Jews must die,” according to KDKA. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/28/gab-social-media-site-used-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-suspect/---split---The mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue has drawn scrutiny on the Gab social media site after the suspect was found to have used it to express anti-Semitic views. The website, Gab.com, said it suspended his account and contacted the authorities after the arrest but it was not enough to stop internet services from cutting ties with it. The website, which is popular with white nationalists and members of the so-called alt-right, said on Saturday night it was being forced offline following the attack that left 11 people dead. It said its hosting provider Joyent would be suspending its services as of Monday morning, while PayPal has also reportedly banned the site. "Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this," the site said on its Twitter account. "We will continue to fight for free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Big tech can not stop us. The mainstream media can not stop us. The People will defend freedom against tyranny as they always have and always will," it tweeted. The website went offline temporarily on Saturday night, after which it tweeted: "We spent the past hour backing up everything in light of our hosting provider pulling service on Monday." Shortly before bursting into the Tree of Life Congregation yeling "all Jews must die", the suspect Robert Bowers posted his final message on Gab. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he said. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital after being shot several times by police, was charged late on Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offences. The 46-year-old appeared to be the author of a recent rash of violently anti-Semitic posts on the controversial social networking website, where conspiracy theories are common. Gab had earlier released a statement saying it had "zero tolerance" for violence or terrorism and was "saddened and disgusted by the news" from Pittsburgh. It said in a post that after learning of the attack, it had matched the name of the alleged shooter to one of its account holders. It then took down the Bowers account and immediately contacted the FBI, adding: "We will do everything in our power to work with law enforcement to see that justice is served." Gab launched in 2016 as a "free-speech" alternative to Twitter. Its founder, Andrew Torba, said existing sites like Twitter and Facebook have a left-leaning monopoly on social media. It allows users to read and write unfiltered messages of up to 300 characters, called "gabs". The home page describes the platform as "a social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online. All are welcome." Gab is a popular gathering place for alt-right activists and white nationalists whose views are unwelcome or banned on other social media platforms. Early members included the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website. Other well known users have included controversial media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. Apple blocked the app from its App store in 2016, citing pornographic content, and later, hate speech. Google blocked the app from its Google Play store for hate speech, which brought a law suit from Gab that was eventually dropped. An investigation by The Telegraph in August found dozens of pages of racist and anti-Semitic material on the website, which was being hosted by Microsoft at the time. “Microsoft terminated its Azure agreement with Gab last month. The Gab.com and Gab.ai websites are no longer hosted on Azure,” a Microsoft spokesperson told the Telegraph after the shooting. One post, in Gab’s “Brexit” group, displays a rifle with the caption “wh--- and ni---- repellent". Another, which was posted repeatedly over the course of several days, claims that Jewish people were responsible for “all labour and sex slavery” and is illustrated by a cartoon of an old man with a large nose. When approached by the Telegraph at the time, a Gab spokesman said: “We don’t do interviews with fake news outlets that employ sophist political activists pretending to be journalists. Figure it out for yourself.” Moments later the official Gab account posted a picture of a Gladiator’s arena on Twitter, writing: “Back in the day they would have just thrown dishonest journalists in here with the gladiators. "They would have lasted all of four seconds.” © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/28/victims-pittsburgh-shooting-identified/---split---A 97-year-old woman who attended synagogue with her daughter; a married couple in their eighties; a pair of fifty-something brothers. Authorities in Pittsburgh on Sunday named the 11 victims of the worst ever gun attack on America’s Jewish community, sending a fresh wave of questions through a tight-knit suburban neighbourhood still trying to understand what could motivate someone to open fire on such an elderly congregation. Two brothers, David and Cecil Rosenthal, were the youngest at 54 and 59. The eldest was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. The dead also included Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Jerry Rabinowitz, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, Irving Younger and husband and wife Bernice and Sylvan Simon. The Rosenthal brothers lived at a home for people with learning disabilities. “Cecil’s laugh was infectious," said Chris Schopf, of Achieva, which manages the home. "David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. “Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable. Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around.” The synagogue is set in the quiet, tree-lined streets of Squirrel Hill, one of Pittsburgh’s older neighbourhoods and the sort of place that looks like it sounds. Bakeries and kosher restaurants are dotted among the detached homes. Locals said the Jewish community was the sort of place where families would raise their children and never move away, making it more stable than other places where different ethnic or religious groups moved in and out. But like many places of worship the synagogue had struggled to keep up attendances, and eventually became the meeting point for three congregations. Older worshippers were the mainstay. Even at 88, Mr Wax was always the first to arrive and the last to leave the New Light Congregation, which met in the basement, according to his friend Myron Snider, who described how the accountant would help his daughters do their taxes without asking for payment. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." Law Claus, former Allegheny County deputy district attorney, paid tribute to Dr Rabinowitz, who he said was much more than his personal physician of three decades. “Dr Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humour," he wrote in an email to former colleagues. “He had a truly uplifting demeanour, and as a practising physician he was among the very best.” This is 66 year-old Jerry Rabinowitz, he was a doctor in Pittsburgh. His nephew said that he would miss “his laughter, with his chest heaving up & down, with a huge smile on his face, that was uncle Jerry. And that bowtie.” He was murdered yesterday in an attack fueled by hate. pic.twitter.com/QXH3Ny5O0p Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbour Jo Stepaniak says, and "they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness." "Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team," she said. The Simons were fixtures in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She'd served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighbourhood, with the couple's dog in years past. In the crowd at Chicago's Federal Plaza, people hold signs bearing the names of those who perished at #TreeOfLifeSynagogue. Bernice Simon died along with her husband, Sylvan. May their memory be for a blessing. And may we find the strength to work to end antisemitism + hate. pic.twitter.com/koQQf9wQnJ Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humour - the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi emeritus, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. Mrs Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. The 74-year-old spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Centre, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Joyce Fienberg, 75 May her memory be a blessing pic.twitter.com/RCU4tXx00z Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, said she was devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being," she said. The research centre's current director, Charles Perfetti, said Mrs Fienberg earned her bachelor's degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and "a certain elegance and dignity" to the center, Perfetti said. "One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting," even if they were brief, he said. "I was always impressed with her." A visible member of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, Mr Stein was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area's Hadassah chapter. "Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him," said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." #Pittsburgh synagogue victim: Friends describe Daniel Stein as a family man. New grandfather. Condolences to his family and friends @KDKA pic.twitter.com/Nm1lkcqsuh The 71-year-old was president of the Men's Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Mr Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up "the religious heart" of the congregation, said Stephen Cohen, the congregation co-president. Mr Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, "he was somebody that everybody liked," Mr Halle said. Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. "I feel a part of me died in that building," Diamond said. Rose Mallinger, 97 May her memory be a blessing pic.twitter.com/F7d0AGtAU8 The oldest of those killed in Saturday's shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he regularly saw her at services. "Rose was really a fixture of the congregation," Mr Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Centre of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Mr Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret "Peg" Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Mr Gottfried, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. Dr. Richard Gottfried May his memory be a blessing pic.twitter.com/PWbFo2sZFz He, along with Mr Wax and Mr Stein, "led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Mr Cohen said. "He died doing what he liked to do most," said Don Salvin, Gottfried's brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. A neighbour in Pittsburgh's Mount Washington neighbourhood remembered Mr Younger as "a really nice guy." Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. "I'm scared for my kids' future," Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. "How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbour?" Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she's lived next door to Mr Younger for several years, said he was a "wonderful" father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner "talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,' Ms Prizner told the Tribune-Review. © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

The only effective protection against poliomyelitis, or polio for short, is vaccination. It is also the only way to eradicate the virus. But it's not that simple. "The original goal was to eradicate poliomyelitis by the year 2000," says Sabine Diedrich of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin. "Then it shifted further and further away." Next, there was a five-year plan. The plan ran from 2013 to 2018, and according to the virologist, "During this period we were supposed to manage finally to eradicate polio." But, Diedrich says, even that is still a very last, small step in the future. R... From Donald Trump in the US to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil — populist politicians are on the rise in many countries around the world. But although they may be separated by distance and culture, these populist movements have one key thing in common: their ability to understand the power of a strong narrative in order to connect with the people. DW spoke with a professor of storytelling and scriptwriter, Jorn Precht, about how populists use classic elements of storytelling to appeal to voters and the dangers of spreading false information via social media. DW: From the perspective of a professio... Police have arrested at least 3,347 people since Friday for protesting the entry of women into a Kerala Hindu temple.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-wizards-20181028-story.html#nt=oft13a-4gp1---split---Chants of “air ball” rang through Staples Center’s lower bowl after a three-pointer by Washington center Thomas Bryant missed the rim late in the Clippers’ blowout victory Sunday. Sitting on the Clippers bench, guard Patrick Beverley held his nose, pretending to sniff something foul. In doing so, he summed up the game. The Clippers never trailed and the Wizards stunk in a 136-104 rout in which nine Clippers scored in double figures, tied for the most in the NBA this season, led by the 22 Tobias Harris scored in 29 minutes. It marked the 11th consecutive home victory over Washington (1-5) and the second straight season-best offensive performance for the Clippers (4-2), who leave for a three-game trip to Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Orlando feeling good about their offense, defense and chemistry, even if, as some in the locker room believe, not everyone in the league sees it. “Other teams look at us as underdogs because you [media] put so much pressure on other teams, so it kind of works in our favor,” said Beverley, who finished with 11 points, four rebounds, four assists and stayed out of foul trouble for the first time this season. “We appreciate it and like to come in under the radar and beat teams.” Wizards guard John Wall scored 18 first-half points but was held scoreless in the second half as the Clippers pulled away. After their lead was trimmed from 18 to 10 midway through the third quarter, the Clippers responded with an 11-0 run that included three-pointers on three consecutive possessions, including two by Beverley. Washington coach Scott Brooks called a timeout to ostensibly insert adjustments, only to watch the Clippers score the next five points after the break. It included another three by Beverley when his defender went under a screen, for a 95-71 lead. “We’ve got to be able to take some pride on the defensive end of the court,” Brooks said. There was good reason for the Wizards to defend Beverley that way: He entered Sunday shooting 17.6% from behind the arc. That he drilled three in a row during the decisive stretch was illustrative of how easily things have come of late for the Clippers, who made 16 of their 29 three-pointers Sunday and shot 54.4% overall with 35 assists. “Unselfishness,” coach Doc Rivers said. “They don’t care. No one’s hunting points, you know, they’re hunting the open guy and that’s a good way to play; it’s the only way we can play, it’s the only way we’ll be good. “There were so many plays where a guy could’ve shot the ball, but his shot was a good shot, he passed it to a great shot.” Avery Bradley, mired in the worst season-opening shooting slump of his career until Friday’s victory at Houston, scored 11 of his 15 points in the first quarter. “I’m starting to pick my spots and try to find out how to play off Tobias, [Danilo Galliniari], Pat; we’re trying to learn how to play with each other,” Bradley said. “We knew it would take time but it’s good it’s flowing a little better now.” Every Clipper with the exception of the injured Luc Mbah a Moute played as Rivers emptied the bench. Reserves accounted for 85 points in the Clippers’ 133-113 victory in Houston and scored 73 more Sunday, led by 17 points in 15 minutes by Lou Williams, who left after the game to attend his 32nd birthday party. His celebration began early as he scored 14 of his team’s 17 points in one stretch of the fourth quarter. When Williams wasn’t hitting shots, center Boban Marjanovic was backing down the Wizards’ Bryant deep in the lane for easy buckets. Marjanovic, whom Bradley dubbed “instant offense,” scored 13 points and grabbed nine rebounds in nearly 12 minutes. The Wizards never found a second-half rhythm. They shot 39.2% against the Clippers, who are holding teams to the second-lowest field-goal percentage. “Everybody’s excited about the offense. But the defense does all the dirty work and that allows the offense to score, you know?” Rivers said. “That’s the real hero in the game is our defense.”

KUALA LUMPUR: Former Utusan Malaysia journalist Amran Ahmad failed in his bid to challenge the decision of the Industrial Court concerning his wrongful dismissal for issuing a slanderous statement against the management of the publishing company. This follows the High Court’s decision dismissing Amran’s judicial review application today.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-permanently-bans-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-website-infowars-n907261---split---Twitter announced Thursday that it had banned the accounts of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his far-right media company Infowars because of "abusive behavior" on the platform. "Today, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope," the company tweeted on Thursday. "We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts' past violations." Infowars did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jones had approximately 900,000 followers on Twitter, while Infowars had around 430,000. Jones was reportedly banned for posting a video in which he confronted CNN reporter Oliver Darcy, an exchange in which he insulted Darcy's appearance. In a video posted to the Infowars website, Jones claimed he was banned for being willing to "speak the truth." "I was taken down not because we lie but because we tell the truth and because we were popular," Jones said. "And then when we ran into Oliver Darcy, who is the secret police captain, who admits he goes around and gets people like Infowars taken off other platforms, because we confronted that monster that has abused us and lied about us, attacked our speech, because of that they took us down." This latest ban comes only a few weeks after Jones was similarly kicked off Facebook and YouTube. Apple also removed Jones and Infowars' podcasts from its platform. Twitter, meanwhile, only put Jones and Infowars in a "time out" for a week. Twitter slapped Jones with the temporary suspension in mid-August, preventing him from using his personal account after he encouraged his followers via a video embedded in a tweet to get their "battle rifles" ready against members of the media and other groups. With the ban from Twitter, Jones has now effectively been "deplatformed" by all major social media companies. While Jones is still active on some far-right websites, the bans had already taken their toll before Twitter acted. An analysis of data by The New York Times found that Jones' audience had roughly been cut in half by the bans from Facebook and YouTube. Twitter said that it typically does not comment on enforcement actions, such as bans and suspensions, but it decided to comment on Jones' case because "we wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case." The social media company said they would continue to monitor reports of abuse from other accounts associated with Jones and Infowars. We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban. Jones made a surprise appearance in Washington on Wednesday, and sat only a few feet behind Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Dorsey also testified before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Twitter faced mounting pressure as critics believed that the platform allowed Jones to spread misinformation, most famously the falsehood that the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School had been staged. Jones is facing multiple defamation suits from parents of the murdered children. Families like Nelba Marquez-Greene's have faced persistent harassment by internet trolls in the years since Jones pushed the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Marquez-Greene's 6-year-old daughter Ana was shot and killed in the shooting. While Marquez-Greene applauded Twitter's suspension of Jones, she said she still finds enforcement of those behind dangerous harassment campaigns on social networks to be inconsistent. "What's disconcerting, although the victory is great, is the randomness of the application of rules," Marquez-Greene told NBC News. "I hope that we can get to a place in society where it doesn't have to happen to you in order for it to be meaningful. Many people who are subject to these violations have much less power than heads of companies and reporters." Outside the hearing on Wednesday, Jones told reporters that the Democratic Party, multinational corporations and the tech industry were conspiring to silence "conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election." "I'm here to be able to face my accusers," Jones declared. "This is the 11th hearing they've had where they make up all these incredible lies about me and others to sell the end of the First Amendment." Dorsey has consistently championed free speech principles, however, and Twitter had previously been hesitant to ban accounts for even extreme hate speech — something that has changed in recent years. In October 2017, Dorsey promised new rules on Twitter in an effort to crack down on hate speech and threats. Dorsey, apparently nonplussed by Jones' presence, addressed these concerns of censorship on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. "Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules," he said in prepared remarks. When Dorsey departed the building, Jones followed him outside to his car and began to yell at him — though it is unclear what Jones said. Jones also confronted Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., outside of the intelligence committee meeting, as Rubio was talking to reporters. The senator eventually gave up on answering questions and told reporters, "you guys can talk to this clown." Meanwhile, mothers like Marquez-Greene just hope that Jones' ban will prevent similar hoaxes and harassment campaigns from popping up in the future. "My hope is that in the next incidents of mass violence, fewer families will have to deal with this on top of burying a loved one," she said. "This isn't, for me, about Alex Jones. This is, for me, about trying to lift up families." © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---2.0---split---https://www.adl.org/blog/white-supremacists-anti-semitic-and-anti-immigrant-sentiments-often-intersect---split---The last post made to the social networking account believed to belong to Robert Bowers, the suspect in Saturday’s deadly shooting spree at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, claimed that “HIAS [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” The post, made just a short time before the attack on the synagogue began, seemed to be an explanation or rationale for the attack.  An examination of what is believed to be Bowers’ account on Gab, a social networking site favored by white supremacists, reveals a deep-seated hatred of Jews. A month ago, the account referred to Jews as “all the vile degenerate oven dodgers,” saying it was time for them to “convert your stuff to shekels and flee. Time is critical.”  The account’s owner appears to have hated Jews for a variety of reasons, but one anti-Semitic trope in particular seems to have motivated him in the days prior to the shooting, and may have even played a role in his decision to unleash his hateful attack: the common white supremacist conspiracy theory that Jews are behind efforts to impose mass immigration on the United States, with the goal of harming or destroying the white race.  The account repeatedly shared others’ Gab posts and images amplifying the anti-Semitic theme of Jews driving immigration. One representative share was a post by user “Black Pilled” intimating that Jews are behind the controversial caravan of asylum seekers making its way from Central America to the United States. The post asks, “Why are Jewish groups using their trucks to transport invaders to our border?” Another comment, originally posted by Johnny Benitez, suggested the same thing and declared, “We are being destroyed, not by a superior army or an act of God, but by our fear of being called anti-[S]emites.”  Unfortunately, these opinions are very common among white supremacists. Modern white supremacy is centered on the notion that whites must fight against the imminent extinction of the white race at the hands of growing numbers of non-whites, who are in turn controlled and manipulated by the Jews. Part of this anti-Semitic conspiracy alleges that Jews are orchestrating the mass immigration of non-whites into North America, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. Below are two of the alleged shooter's apparent Gab posts that include references to ADL and a belief that the organization is one of the Jewish institutions promoting mass immigration. American anti-Semites believe that Jews were responsible for post-World War II immigration reforms that opened up immigration to the United States for non-Europeans. A 2017 essay posted on an anti-Semitic website by “Quintus Sertorious” titled “The Jews and Weaponized Immigration,” claimed that one of the worst defeats whites had suffered “in the war to prevent White genocide” was the “expurgation of all sanity from our immigration policies.” Today, the author alleged, Jews were focused on “important the most disparate, incompatible, and mutually hostile identity groups from around the globe.” The United States was being “cowed into miscegenated Talmudic submission.”  Such opinions are common on white supremacist websites such as Stormfront. Jews, one Stormfront poster wrote in 2011, were largely responsible for bringing third-world immigrants to white countries, where they “eagerly mix with the White inhabitants to produce mud-colored offspring to be raised as the next generation of racially inferior serfs whose lives and labor will be owned by the Jewish aristocracy of their Zionist New World Order.” European Stormfronters believe the same thing; as one member put it in 2015, “We know that the Jew is behind the promotion of mass immigration of just about anyone into Europe as part of their plan to dilute the white race.”  Andrew Anglin, who runs The Daily Stormer, one of the most popular white supremacist websites, has spread recordings on Jews and immigration by noted far right figures such as anti-Semitic propagandist Kevin MacDonald and deceased neo-Nazi leader William Pierce. The white supremacist Creativity Alliance claims that Jews have “allowed illegal dark race aliens to invade our White borders by the millions” to act as “shock troops” for the Jewish plan to “mongrelize the superior White Race, and exterminate those that will not mongrelize.”  Such sentiments are so common that they have even made their way into the entry on “Immigration” on Rightpedia, the far-right version of Wikipedia. “Most people do not realize,” states the site, “that Jews are the driving force behind mass immigration and demographic genocide.”  In 2018, anti-Semitic candidates such as Patrick Little and John Fitzgerald have promoted similar ideas about immigration. Fitzgerald even published an essay on his campaign website titled “Why Are Powerful Jews Pushing Mass-Immigration And Forced-Multiculturalism Throughout The U.S. And Europe?” The answer, according to the essay? Because of a premeditated agenda “to eventually destroy all ethnic groups with the exception of the most powerful and wealthy of Jews.”  With such vehemently anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant opinions routinely promoted by white supremacists, coupled with demagogic anti-immigrant rhetoric from many ostensibly mainstream media sources and public figures, it is not hard to imagine that such hateful rhetoric may have played a role in tipping Bowers, who appears to be an angry anti-Semite and white supremacist, into allegedly committing a violent and hateful act.  © 2018 Anti-Defamation League.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/eric-trump-says-harsh-political-053102730.html---split---Eric Trump conceded to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on Saturday that harsh political rhetoric “might” be linked to recent violence, including the shooting death of 11 people in an apparent anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier — or it “might not.” “Listen,” he also said of the massacre, “America mourns, right?” Pirro quizzed President Donald Trump’s second son on both the synagogue shooting and the pipe bombs mailed earlier in the week to Democratic political figures and others who his father has targeted for harsh and criticism and nasty comments. The man arrested for the pipe bombs, Cesar Sayoc, was living in a van plastered with photos of the president and images of some of the Trump targets with gunsight crosshairs over their faces. Pirro, referring to the weeks’, asked Eric Trump “is this a sign of the rhetoric and the outrage people are hearing? Is there any correlation between the two?” “Listen, there might be, and there might not be,” he responded. “At the end of the day, this is a very sick, sick, deranged human ... subhuman,” he said, referring to suspected synagogue shooter Robert Bowers. Trump also complained that “it seems like we’ve gotten to a place in life and society where everything has to be kind of politicized ... Somebody has to point a political finger at absolutely everything. At the end of the day, this is a sick, sick, sick person.” Check it out in the interview above.
---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/business/false-flag-theory-bombs-conservative-media.html---split---Advertisement Supported by The Shift By Kevin Roose Just hours after the news broke this week that explosive devices had been sent to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, a conspiracy theory began to take shape in certain corners of conservative media. The bombs, this theory went, were not actually part of a plot to harm Democrats, but were a “false flag” operation concocted by leftists in order to paint conservatives as violent radicals ahead of the elections next month. “These ‘Suspicious Package’ stories are false flags, carefully planned for the midterms,” tweeted Jacob Wohl, a pro-Trump internet troll who writes for Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. By nightfall, as more explosives were discovered addressed to Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, and Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under Mr. Obama, the fact-free explanation had gelled: The bombs were props, planted by Democratic operatives and amplified by a biased liberal media. A woman arrived at a debate between the two candidates for Florida governor, Ron DeSantis and Andrew Gillum, with a sign that read “Democrats Fake News Fake Bombs.” Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business host and confidant of President Trump, echoed that line in a tweet that he later deleted. Conspiratorial thinking has always been with us — the grassy knoll, the moon landing, the Freemasons. But it has been turbocharged in the Trump era, as cable news networks and pliant social media networks allow hastily assembled theories to spread to millions in an instant. Often, by the time the official, evidence-based explanation has taken shape, it has already been drowned out by a megaphonic chorus of cranks and attention-hungry partisans. “The process by which something gets called a false flag has accelerated,” said Anna Merlan, the author of “Republic of Lies,” a coming book about conspiracy theories. “People who make a living conspiracy-peddling are in an arms race with each other, so there’s a rush to stake out that territory and start spinning their narratives about what happened.” [READ MORE: Two more bombs have been found, authorities said on Friday.] Within hours of the first bomb’s discovery, conservative media figures were openly speculating about the true motives behind the campaign. Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage and other high-profile commentators flocked to an alternative narrative that could explain the targeted threats to top Democrats without blaming those Democrats’ political opponents. “Republicans just don’t do this kind of thing,” Mr. Limbaugh said on his radio show. (Critics quickly provided Mr. Limbaugh with plenty of counterexamples, including abortion clinic bombings committed by right-wing extremists.) As prominent conservatives tiptoed around the conspiracy theory swamps, the right-wing internet dove in headfirst. Users on a pro-Trump Reddit forum called r/the_donald frantically assembled evidence to buttress the unfounded theory that the bombs were a left-wing setup. Conservatives on Facebook and Twitter distilled the theory into memes and talking points that were shared thousands of times. Groups originally formed to promote QAnon, a sprawling pro-Trump conspiracy theory, latched on and turned up the volume even higher. Historically, “false flag” conspiracy theories — named for a naval maneuver in which a ship flies a different country’s flag in order to trick enemies into retreating or to facilitate an escape — have remained on the edges of American discourse. Alex Jones, the conspiracy-theory-loving Infowars founder, was labeled a crank and worse for theorizing that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were an “inside job,” and suggesting that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was an elaborate hoax concocted in order to promote gun control. Mr. Jones has been largely pushed to the fringes of the internet — kicked off Twitter, Facebook and a dozen other services — and his cries for attention now seem mostly pitiful. (This week, he was filmed yelling at a pile of manure outside a rally for President Trump in Texas.) But his spirit lives on in the larger universe of pro-Trump media, which has fused the conspiratorial grandeur of Infowars with an unshakable faith in Mr. Trump’s righteousness. Conspiracy theorists who might once have resorted to handing out subway pamphlets and shouting from street corners have found hungry, durable audiences on cable news shows and social networks. And false flag philosophy — the idea that powerful groups stage threats and tragic events to advance their agendas — is now a bizarrely common element of national news stories. “The reason we’re seeing more false flag narratives is not that there are necessarily more of them, but that they’re more visible,” Ms. Merlan said. “It’s much easier for a casual news consumer to see them on Twitter.” Conspiracy theories most often rise around fast-moving news events, like mass shootings and bomb threats, in which fuzzy initial reports often give way to more accurate explanations later on. And sometimes, those questioning the most apparent motives turn out to be justified. Last year, a string of bomb threats against Jewish institutions in the United States was thought to be an act of anti-Semitic intimidation until police apprehended a Jewish teenager in Israel, whom they suspected of making the threats. The 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando was thought to be an anti-L.G.B.T. hate crime until further evidence suggested the shooter had no idea it was a gay club. One appeal of heat-of-the-moment conspiracy theories is that they allow for blame-shifting. Candace Owens, a right-wing activist and media personality who has been invited to the White House, earlier this week responded to the bombs by tweeting that “these leftists are going ALL OUT for midterms.” (Ms. Owens, who is now the communications director for the conservative student group Turning Point USA, appeared on Infowars with Mr. Jones as recently as last year.) She later deleted the tweet, but wrote another one in which she said that she still believed that “when it comes to political violence, the left is the likely culprit.” There are structural reasons for the conspiracy theory boom. Social media platforms like YouTube, Reddit and Facebook have allowed fringe thinkers to bypass traditional gatekeepers and reach millions of people directly. In addition, the dominance of Fox News and other partisan media outlets has created a flourishing market for conspiracy-driven outrage. And a polarized electorate has eagerly lapped up explanations for major news events that conform to their views. The desire for politically convenient explanations is not contained to the right. Soon after the bombs were reported, and before key facts about them were known, liberals on Twitter adopted the term “MAGAbomb” to describe the campaign, referring both to the explosive devices and to Mr. Trump’s signature rallying cry. It is Mr. Trump, of course, who has done more than any other prominent figure to promote (or in the case of the racist conspiracy theory about Mr. Obama’s birth certificate, to popularize) a number of conspiracy theories. Other theories have taken root among his followers — like Pizzagate, QAnon and the baseless, sensational claims made about Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault — often without official censure. “We have a president who pushes these ideas because he built a coalition that believes in conspiracy theories,” said Joseph Uscinski, an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. “He has to continue pushing these ideas to keep his people motivated.” Conspiracy theories play especially well on social media, which amplifies provocative and engaging content by design and often rewards misinformation with increased distribution. One study published this year, led by M.I.T. researchers, found that on Twitter, falsehoods were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than accurate news. Conspiracy theories are not false news, exactly. They often rely on a speck of doubt, or a gap in the evidentiary trail, to make a bold claim, even if they ignore some of the other available proof. But they do travel over the same networks, and stand out from more accurate — if predictable — stories in much the same way. [What we know — and don’t know — about the bombs] Fact-checking, long offered as a possible antidote to misinformation, is not likely to solve the problem. The available data on the effectiveness of fact-checking, especially on social media, is mixed. Facebook halted a program last year that labeled false news stories with red flags, after finding that the labels actually induced more people to click. The company’s current approach is to decrease the visibility of stories labeled false by third-party fact-checkers, in hopes of starving them of oxygen. The real solution, of course, is likely to be cultural, rather than technological. A White House occupied by a conspiracist-in-chief is not likely to do much to quell the spread of implausible narratives, nor is a conservative media apparatus that profits from the popularity of these theories. As long as Mr. Trump is in office, conspiracy theorists will continue to raise the specter of false flags, and some in power will feel empowered to take them seriously. “If we had President Jeb Bush, we wouldn’t be wondering if he believed these theories,” Mr. Uscinski said.

The man arrested for the pipe bombs, Cesar Sayoc, was living in a van plastered with photos of the president and images of some of the Trump targets with gunsight crosshairs over their faces. Pirro, referring to the weeks’, asked Eric Trump “is this a sign of the rhetoric and the outrage people are hearing? Is there any correlation between the two?” “Listen, there might be, and there might not be,” he responded. “At the end of the day, this is a very sick, sick, deranged human ... subhuman,” he said, referring to suspected synagogue shooter Robert Bowers. Trump also complained that “it seems like we’ve gotten to a place in life and society where everything has to be kind of politicized ... Somebody has to point a political finger at absolutely everything. At the end of the day, this is a sick, sick, sick person.” Check it out in the interview above.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-duwe-rocque-mass-shootings-mental-illness-20180223-story.html#nt=barker---split---"Repeat after me: Mass shooters are not disproportionately mentally ill." This is the opening line of a meme that's been circulating in the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, Fla. But this and other efforts to downplay the role of mental illness in mass shootings are simply misleading. There is a clear relationship between mental illness and mass public shootings. At the broadest level, peer-reviewed research has shown that individuals with major mental disorders (those that substantially interfere with life activities) are more likely to commit violent acts, especially if they abuse drugs. When we focus more narrowly on mass public shootings — an extreme and, fortunately, rare form of violence — we see a relatively high rate of mental illness. According to our research, at least 59% of the 185 public mass shootings that took place in the United States from 1900 through 2017 were carried out by people who had either been diagnosed with a mental disorder or demonstrated signs of serious mental illness prior to the attack. (We define a mass public shooting as any incident in which four or more victims are killed with a gun within a 24-hour period at a public location in the absence of military conflict, collective violence or other criminal activity, such as robberies, drug deals or gang turf wars.) Mother Jones found a similarly high rate of potential mental health problems among perpetrators of mass shootings — 61% — when the magazine examined 62 cases in 2012. Both rates are considerably higher than those found in the general population — more than three times higher than the rate of mental illness found among American adults, and about 15 times higher than the rate of serious mental illness found among American adults. It’s possible for mass public shootings to be both a gun problem and a mental health problem. And yet this nuance often gets lost in mainstream news reports. In a story that largely suggested mass murderers are not "insane," the New York Times cited research showing that, in fact, mass murderers are nearly 20 times more likely to have a "severe" mental illness than the general population. According to our research, only one-third of the people who have committed mass shootings in the U.S. since 1900 had sought or received mental health care prior to their attacks, which suggests that most shooters did not seek or receive care they may have needed. This treatment gap is underscored by evidence showing that the U.S. has higher rates of untreated serious mental illness than most other Western countries. Additional research shows that the gap is even larger for males, who have committed 99% of the country's mass public shootings. Although the link between mass shootings and mental illness has only recently gained widespread recognition, the correlation itself is longstanding. Indeed, we see it in some of the earliest such shootings in the U.S. Gilbert Twigg, who opened fire on a concert crowd in Winfield, Kan., in 1903, killing nine, had displayed signs of paranoia beforehand. Howard Unruh, who shot and killed 13 people in Camden, N.J., in 1949, was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. (Both were also Army veterans who had seen combat.) One of the primary reasons some are reluctant to establish the link between mass shootings and mental illness is a fear that it will lead to the stigmatization of such disorders. This concern is valid. The vast majority of people with mental disorders are not violent, after all. Conversely, some have insisted — wrongly, in our opinion — that mass public shootings are strictly a mental health problem rather than a gun problem. They, too, are on the wrong side of the evidence. It's possible for mass public shootings to be both a gun problem and a mental health problem. Increasing access to mental health care may reduce mass public shootings. But while such events are more commonplace than they should be, the reality may be that they're still too rare to develop and implement policies that reduce their incidence or severity specifically. Policymakers should therefore focus on strategies that have shown promise in reducing gun violence in general, like a federal universal background check. Because there's still a lot we don't understand about mass shootings, we need to invest in research to develop evidence-based solutions. In the meantime, the media should stop glorifying this violence. In the midst of our tribal hyperpartisanship, the debate over mass shootings is doomed to continue ignoring facts. We won't make any progress until those on the mental health side and those on the gun side find common ground that's rooted in empirical reality.

Mr Das petitioned that the high court should rule that the temple should be open to only devotees. The court refused to accept this. The bench, however, asked the Kerala government and the Travancore Devasom Board to file the... Sri Lankan police on Monday arrested deposed oil minister Arjuna Ranatunga over a shooting that killed one person on the weekend, police spokesman said. "Colombo Crime division arrested Ranatunga over the shooting incident and he will be produced to the court shortly," police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera told Reuters. President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday declared that the cabinet had been dissolved with the appointment of a new prime minister a day earlier. Since then, members of trade unions linked to the new prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, have blocked ministers from the old cabine... Bajaj Auto is building a new factory in Lerma, State of Mexico, with a capacity of 50,000 units a year. Bajaj, India's largest motorcycle exporter, has recently signed an agreement with the Surman Group to build the factory in Mexico. The Surman Group will be Bajaj Auto's official distributors, and the production from the new factory will be exclusively for the Mexican market. Over the past few months, since August 2018, the Surman Group has reportedly sold 1,500 Bajaj motorcycles in Mexico, and the company estimates that next year, sales will reach 36,000 units. "We haven't determined the ... The Ayodhya temple-mosque dispute will be taken up not now but in January, the Supreme Court said in a four-minute hearing today that could mean greater pressure on the ruling BJP from its hardline Hindu affiliates, ahead of the 2019 national polls, for an ordinance or special order to facilitate a Ram temple at the site. "We have other priorities," said Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, when the Uttar Pradesh government argued that it was a 100-year-old issue that should be taken up on priority by the government. The Chief Justice also said that an "appropriate bench" would decide when to take u... India opener Rohit Sharma scored his 21st One-day International (ODI) century during the fourth ODI against the Windies at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai on Monday. Rohit reached the coveted three-figure mark off 98 balls in the 33rd over. En route his century, Rohit hit 13 boundaries and one six. With the five-match series tied at 1-1, India captain Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bat. Indian openers Rohit and Shikhar Dhawan provided a solid start to the hosts by building a 71-run partnership. However, Windies pacers Keemo Paul gave his team a much-needed breakthrough by dismissin... Reliance Industries, currently country's second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance's refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when country's oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world's third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country's retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations. This push into the domestic f... In a proud moment for police constable Janardhan Singh, his son Anoop Singh has been posted as the Superintendent of Police (North) in Lucknow, a city where he himself is posted.

An Indonesian man has described how Jakarta's notorious traffic inadvertently saved his life on Monday after he arrived too late to catch the doomed Lion Air plane which plunged into the sea minutes after taking off. Sony Setiawan, an official in Indonesia's finance ministry, had meant to be on board the ill-fated flight JT610, a journey he and his colleagues caught on a weekly basis. But while his friends battled their way through Jakarta's daily congestion to make the flight, Sony found himself stuck on a toll road for hours. "I usually take (flight) JT610 -- my friends and I always take ... During the fourth One-day International at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, Windies all-rounder Keemo Paul dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and then followed it up with a celebration you usually associate with the southpaw Indian opener. After Dhawan got caught out after trying to pull a slightly short of length delivery towards the deep mid-wicket boundary, Paul imitated Dhawan's trademark 'thigh five' celebration, leaving most people in splits. Dhawan's struggle with converting his starts into big scores continues as he was again dismissed for 38. Watch this video, which is doing the rounds on so... Actress Shveta Salve was on a vacation in Goa with her family and friends when she was rudely interrupted by social media trolls for posting a picture, in which she can be seen smoking a cigarette with a glass of wine in her hand. The Hip Hip Hurray actress had first posted the pictures on her Instagram story, however, after receiving direct messages from some Instagram users, who shamed her apparently for "setting a bad example" for her daughter, Shveta added the pictures to her Instagram page with a note for the trolls. "Yes I drink and smoke... I am real, honest and basic like that. It h... Princess Ayako married commoner Kei Moriya on Monday at a traditional ceremony at Tokyo's Meiji Shrine, to become the latest female royal to leave Japan's imperial family. The 28-year-old princess, the third daughter of Emperor Akihito's late cousin Prince Takamado, tied the knot with Kei Moriya, a 32-year-old employee of shipping company Nippon Yusen. The princess wore a many-layered court kimono and molded hairdo typical of the imperial aristocracy, while the groom wore a black tuxedo with grey trousers for the ceremony at the shrine dedicated to the spirit of her great-grandfather, Emper... Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have not confirmed their wedding date to their fans and the media yet, however, it appears that the couple will soon exchange their wedding vows. In New York, Priyanka's team hosted a bridal shower for her, in which she looked absolutely stunning in a white Marchesa feathered dress paired with nude Christian Louboutin pumps. She accessorised her look with a diamonds string necklace from Tiffany (from where Nick Jonas bought her engagement ring too). Priyanka's stylist Mimi Cuttrell shared a photo of the actress all set for the party. In the photo, Priyanka pos... Pakistan completely outplayed Australia in the Test and T20 series. They convincingly beat Australia 1-0 in the 2-match Test series and completed a 3-0 T20 series rout of Australia. Pakistan beat Australia by 33 runs in the third and final T20I to complete the series triumph. Former Pakistan captain and all-rounder Shoaib Malik scored 18 and became the second-highest run-scorer in T20 international history, passing New Zealand's Brendon McCullum. Pakistan has been facing brickbats for quite some time but their performances in this series showed why they remain one of the top teams. Taking n... In a touching gesture, thousands on Twitter came together to wish the daughter of Major Akshay Girish on her birthday. A moving post on Twitter, shared on Sunday, urged netizens to wish Naina on her fifth birthday. Naina is the daughter of Major Akshay Girish, who died in the line of duty during a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Nagrota almost two years ago. Naina was just three when her father and six other soldiers died as they defended the army base camp when heavily-armed terrorists entered the premises before dawn, leading to a five-hour gun battle.

Born in 1959, Justice Bopanna enrolled as an advocate in November 1984 and practised in civil, constitutional, company, service and labour matters in the Karnataka High Court as well as in the civil and labour courts, according to his profile details on the website of the Karnataka... Mohammad Amir was once again ignored by the Pakistan selectors, who on Monday named an unchanged side for the three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series against New Zealand. The selectors put faith in the winning combination that whitewashed Australia 3-0 in the recently-concluded T20I series in United Arab Emirates. The same 15-member squad means experienced pacers Amir and Wahab Riaz continue to be left out of the team. On Sunday, opener Babar Azam struck a half-century and leg-spinner Shadab Khan claimed three wickets as Pakistan beat Australia by 33 runs in the final T20I in Dubai... Delhi's air quality continued to remain in the "very poor" category today as a thick haze engulfed the city which is battling alarming levels of pollution. An overall Air Quality Index of 348 was recorded, according to data of the Central Pollution Control Board.

A kangaroo that hopped into the sea for a dip at a Melbourne beach had to be rescued by Australian police and brought back to life with CPR, officers said Sunday. Officers said they were called to Safety Beach in Melbourne on Saturday afternoon amid reports the native animal was struggling in the water. When they arrived, the roo had already made its way back onto dry land and was on the sand covered with a blanket by a beachgoer. But as they approached, it suddenly turned around and bounded back into the waves. "It began to swim but got into difficulty in the swell and breaking waves and w... Vivo has launched a new Vivo V9 Pro variant in India. The Chinese mobile maker had first unveiled the Vivo V9 Pro in the country last month, but it came with 6GB of RAM, and was exclusive to Amazon India and the Vivo Store. However, a new 4GB RAM model of the handset has been listed on Flipkart ahead of the e-commerce giant's Big Diwali Sale. While Vivo has not revealed any availability details of the Vivo V9 Pro, the Flipkart listing suggests that the smartphone will go on sale on November 1, which is when the Flipkart sale will start.

Bigg Boss 12 wild card entrant Rohit Suchanti is facing resistance from several housemates, especially Sreesanth, who often mocks the 22-year-old actor's achievements, wondering aloud if he has the "kabiliyat" to participate in the reality show. On Monday, Rohit's mother Rajini Suchanti shared a note via her son's Instagram account, in which she listed Rohit's achievements - he has starred as lead in three television soaps including Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya - and said: "Rohit has achieved so much at such a young age and he has lead by example, for which his family and friends love him.

Green vegetables are essential components of a well-balanced diet and are said to be beneficial for overall health. They supply us with numerous vitamins, minerals, carotenoids and phytochemicals. In fact, the antioxidants present in dark green leafy vegetables can inhibit certain health conditions by removing free radicals from the body. Apart from being the superfoods that they are, green vegetables are said to help lose weight. Winters are here and if you are looking to cut the bulge, you could try adding more greens to your plate. These fibre-, protein- and iron-rich veggies can help yo... The oceans are loud and getting louder all the time. And marine mammals must live in the din. These animals take different approaches to the noise: Dolphins perform the equivalent of shouting. Humpback whales, when competing with a nearby boat, go silent. "A lot of people imagine that underwater is this really quiet place, but it isn't," said biologist Helen Bailey, who studies marine mammals and sea turtles at the University of Maryland. Ocean sounds are more than just crashing waves. Sharp noises, like sonar used in oil exploration or explosive Navy war games, can damage whale ears. Busy ... Students of a cooking and confectionery school in Fukuoka made a mosaic depicting Leonardo Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" with about 2,200 slices of bread. The artwork will be shown to the public at the annual festival of the school, Nakamura Culinary School, on Saturday and Sunday. A group of about 30 students spent about two months completing the work, which is 2.4 meters (about 7.8 feet) tall and 1.5 meters wide. They started by baking loaves of bread, some white and some black, with the latter containing cocoa powder. The loaves were sliced, the crusts were trimmed off, and the bread was dried.... A man in China was recently left shocked on realising the animal blocking the road he was driving down was not just any other wild beast but a Siberian tiger. The incident took place in Fuyuan City, Heilongjiang Province, on Thursday. According to news.sina.com, Park Yajun was driving farm machinery in a rice field when he saw the tiger sitting by the road. Scared, Mr Yajun hid inside his car and filmed a video of the tiger. He then went home and shared the video with his friends, who called the police. However, by the time the police arrived at the scene, the tiger had already left. The vi... Former army captain Jair Bolsonaro was elected president of Brazil on Sunday, promising a fundamental change in direction for the giant Latin American country, the latest to take a turn to the right. Despite repulsing many with his open support of the torture used by Brazil's former military regime, as well as remarks deemed misogynist, racist and homophobic, Bolsonaro managed to tap voters' deep anger with corruption, crime and economic malaise. Official results gave the controversial president-elect 55.13 percent of the vote to 44.87 for leftist opponent Fernando Haddad, with 99.99 percen... Sushmita Sen recently treated her Instafam to a video of her elder daughter Renee practicing singing with Rohman Shawl, whom the actress is reportedly dating.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-rockets-20181026-story.html#nt=related-content---split---Outside the double doors leading to the visitors’ locker room inside Toyota Center, a horde of Clippers coaches and staffers stood Friday night staring at sheets of paper still warm from the printer. They were studying the box score from a 133-113 victory over the Houston Rockets with eyes wide, as if to confirm that what they had just witnessed had, in fact, taken place. Against Houston’s cheesecloth defense, the Clippers produced by far their best offensive performance. The team that entered the night among the league’s bottom third in offensive efficiency ended it by shooting season highs of 54.4% and 52.2% from three-point range. The Clippers’ bench, led by Montrezl Harrell’s career-high 30 points and Lou Williams’ 23, combined for 85 points, the most by the club since at least 1984-85 and the most by any NBA team’s reserves since Dec. 26, 2012. “It was great,” coach Doc Rivers said. Said Houston coach Mike D’Antoni: “Our defense was just awful.” Despite the return of Chris Paul from a two-game suspension for fighting, Houston sputtered without injured star James Harden by shooting 38.8% and had no answer for the run that turned a tight game into a rout. The Clippers, who beat Houston last week while Paul was out, outscored the Rockets 17-0 during a 5-minute 4-second stretch spanning the third and fourth quarters to take a 24-point lead. The rout was so one-sided it hardly mattered the Clippers (3-2) turned the ball over 15 times. They matched their season average for points with nine minutes to play and led by 28 by exploiting a defense that switched constantly and had “no continuity,” D’Antoni said. “You can point at so many different guys,” Rivers said. “Tobias [Harris] in that stretch in the third quarter when they were making their run, makes two big threes. [Harrell] was phenomenal. Milos [Teodosic] was phenomenal. Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] came in and played well. Pat [Beverley], the whole team. “It’s just who we are. We don’t have that one-guy team. We have a team and it’s fun to coach.” L.A. shot a season-high 56.8% in the first half to lead by nine and Williams feasted against his old team one day before his 32nd birthday. After practicing three-pointers from 25 feet or longer during warmups, he sunk two from that range in the first half while scoring 19 points in 13 minutes. That tied for the most by any NBA reserve in a half this season. “We were joking with Lou this morning at shootaround like, ‘Hey, Lou, we haven’t seen Lou yet,’” Rivers said. “I think maybe he took it personal or whatever but he was phenomenal. The whole team.” The bench continued its tear after halftime. Teodosic scored eight points with seven rebounds and five assists in his season debut, including a football-style pass the length of the court that led to a transition layup. On the bench with foul trouble yet again, Beverley raised his arms to signal a touchdown. Harrell collected offensive rebounds and turned them into second-chance dunks, but also went to the free-throw line 15 times and made all but one. Rivers had all but dared his team to be more aggressive after playing passively Tuesday in New Orleans and the Clippers finished with a season-high 38 free-throw attempts. When Harrell checked out for good with 4:15 to play, the entire Clippers bench stood to bump fists and congratulate the former Rocket, who was traded with Williams and Beverley a year ago in the deal that sent Paul to Houston. “Obviously Trez was drafted here and traded,” Williams said. “That creates confidence and I’m sure he wanted to come put on a show. He happened to have a huge night.” At the court’s other end, Harden stared dead ahead on the Houston bench. The team that earned last year’s top seed in the Western Conference and took Golden State to seven games in the conference finals is 1-4. “There’s no need for panic,” said Paul, who scored 12 points with eight assists and six rebounds, but the Rockets were outscored by 26 with him on the floor. “I don’t even think that word should be even be trying to creep in here.” Many Rockets fans had long since left by the final buzzer, but one of the last to stick it out was former Houston great Tracy McGrady, who left looking dour.

Yahoo Japan user Kuriaisu1122 recently sold a prototype Wii remote that bears only superficial similarity to the one that shipped in 2006. The button layout is the same, but this two-piece controller had a wired GameCube connection and even required plugging the sensor bar into a GameCube memory card slot. The main remote and nunchuck control joined together through Ethernet rather than the finished proprietary link, and the primary controls (including the D-pad and main buttons) came from the Game Boy Advance... The iPhone XR can take some quality portrait mode photos with its single camera, but there's a catch: for now, its reliance on software-based object detection limits it to photos of people. You might have more flexibility before long. The developers of the camera app Halide have found enough available depth data to snap portrait shots of non-human objects, starting with pets. The depth map is crude and could lead to more "temperamental" photography than with the iPhone XS' dual cameras, particularly in situations where there's not enough difference between the foreground and background. How... China's young private spaceflight industry has enjoyed some success, but it's still facing setbacks. The first private attempt at a satellite launch failed on October 27th when the third stage of LandSpace's Zhuque-1 rocket didn't reach orbit. It's not certain what led to the failure. However, the vehicle was carrying a commercial satellite for the state-owned network CCTV. Landspace spun the mishap by claiming that that Zhuque-1 had "already completed" the mission before it even left the launchpad, but didn't explain why. It's also not clear what steps the company will take next. China has... Many people aren't that fond of paying for mobile apps, but Google might have a simple solution: bundle it all in a subscription. XDA and Kieron Quinn have discovered both code references and a Google Opinion Rewards survey hinting at a "Play Pass" app subscription service. According to the survey, it might offer "hundreds of dollars" worth of apps and games for an unspecified monthly rate. There's no indication if or when Play Pass would go live, so don't count on giving it a spin just yet. This isn't the first Android app subscription service, but it could be the most influential. Studies... Bethesda has made a habit of releasing Switch versions of high-profile games (with the help of Panic Button) despite technological limits, but it won't be pulling a rabbit out of a hat with Fallout 76. Marketing exec Pete Hines told guests at PAX Australia that it wouldn't bring the apocalyptic shared-world game to the Switch because it "wasn't doable." The developer has asked about the possibility of supporting Nintendo's system with every game it's working on, Hines said -- it just wasn't an option here. The decision isn't completely surprising. Doom, Skyrim and Wolfenstein II were focuse... There are many, many games that recreate the look of 8-bit and 16-bit games, but there isn't a lot for people who grew up with the first generation of 3D-oriented consoles. Where's their nostalgia hit? Playtonic Games is taking care of it. The studio is releasing a "64-bit Tonic" for Yooka-Laylee that gives the game a very appropriate Nintendo 64 flair. Yes, you too can revisit the heady days of the mid-'90s with tube TV fuzziness, muddy textures, crude lighting effects and even choppy frame rates. The 64-bit mode is coming "soon" to PC, PS4, Switch and Xbox One players as a free update. Yo... You don't have to rely on tiny icons or word-of-mouth leaks to know what the next iPad Pro will look like -- Apple has provided a good clue all on its own. The 9to5Mac team has discovered an iOS icon that shows the 2018 iPad Pro in much clearer detail, including the absence of a home button (and thus the presence of Face ID) and a not-quite-edge-to-edge display. It's unclear if everything is to scale, since Apple occasionally exaggerates icon details for the sake of clarity, but there's little doubt as to what the tablet will look like. You may see plenty of iPhone carrier news surrounding ... IBM isn't a stranger to Linux by any stretch, but it might just become one of the platform's strongest supporters in the near future -- and shake up the cloud landscape, for that matter. IBM has announced a deal to buy Linux giant and open source enterprise software developer Red Hat for the equivalent value of $34 billion. Provided it clears regulatory hurdles, the acquisition should close in the second half of 2019. If you ask IBM, the deal is all about the cloud. It expects to become the world's leading "hybrid cloud provider" (that is, a mix of local and outside cloud services) and will... Gab continues to lose support from internet services following the anti-Semitic mass shooting in Pittsburgh. Hosting provider Joyent is suspending service for Gab as of the morning of October 29th, likely leaving the social network "down for weeks," according to a tweet. Joyent only said there had been a "notice of a breach of our Terms of Service," but it was likely a response to Gab's inaction against the shooter's numerous racist conspiracy posts ahead of the attack, including one that same morning. It might lose another payment provider, too. Stripe has warned Gab that it's violating po... ByNick Guy and Sarah Witman This post was done in partnership with Wirecutter.

When Apple introduced the 12-inch MacBook in early 2015, USB-C was merely a curiosity for most people, but now that many new laptops have dropped legacy ports, USB-C has gone from interesting to important. The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, as well as Windows laptops from HP, Asus, Acer, and more, offer only USB-C p... Between the political theater and unreal earnings reports, this has been a surreal week for the ages. But while you were glued to the news feeds, an AI-generated art piece sold for silly money, NASA fixed the Hubble by jiggling its handle and a band of clever thieves perpetrated a multimillion-download ad scam that would put the Ocean's crew to shame. 300,000 animations amidst 100 hour weeks: Red Dead Redemption is one of the most anticipated games of the year but ran afoul of fans even before its release over accusations that Rockstar Games had been working its developers like rented mules... After a few weeks of waiting, Roku's promised Google Assistant control is here. If you're using a TV or player running at least Roku OS 8.1, you can link the Google Home app to your Roku account and control core functions using only voice and an "on Roku" suffix. You can launch channels, search for shows and control playback on most devices, while TV owners can turn on the set, adjust volume or switch inputs. The phrasing can occasionally get awkward -- it's not intuitive to say "hey Google, pause on Roku" when you have to answer the door. This won't do anything if you prefer Alexa and othe... Internet giants are continuing their crackdown on hate speech following the anti-Semitic mass shooting in Pittsburgh. PayPal has banned the social network Gab, a known haven for hate speech, after reports revealed that the shooter was a frequent poster and had signaled his intentions shortly before the attack. While PayPal didn't provide an immediate reason for the ban in its message to Gab, the payment platform told The Verge in a statement that it didn't accept a site that was "explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance." It characterized the resp... The military is authorized to shoot down drones flying over bases, but at least two naval bases are still struggling to get operators to stop getting too close. Now, the FAA has issued a stricter warning against flying drones too near Naval Base Kitsap (Washington) and Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay (Georgia) in order "to address concerns about potentially malicious drone operations over certain, high-priority maritime operations." More specifically, the FAA is restricting drone flights near the US Navy and US Coast Guard vessels operating in those bases. Kitsap is one of Navy's strategic n... An important part of the Xbox One's mouse and keyboard support is now in place for some players -- namely, the mouse part. Members of the Alpha Skip Ahead and Beta programs can try mouse support through a Quest in the Xbox Insider Hub. You'll be limited to Warframe, but this gives you a chance to see how the full mouse-plus-keyboard combo works in practice ahead of the finished release. The feature doesn't require any specific hardware. Like before, Microsoft is also promising optional, game-by-game compatibility rather than universal support. It's trying to walk a fine line where it offers... Antivirus programs, by their nature, introduce a degree of risk. Since they have to scan malicious data to stop attacks (and thus need extensive permissions), a piece of malware that exploits antivirus flaws can typically run with impunity. That could be much more difficult if you're using Windows 10's built-in safeguards, though. Microsoft is gradually rolling out a Windows Insider preview where Defender Antivirus has the option of running in a sandbox -- the first "complete" solution to do this, the company said. Should the worst happen and malware targets Defender Antivirus, any hostile ... Swiss robotics company ABB has revealed that it's spending $150 million to build an advanced robotics factory in Shanghai -- one that will use robots to build robots. The company will rely on its YuMi single-arm robots, which it once used to conduct an orchestra, for small parts assembly. It also plans to make extensive use"of its SafeMove2 software in the facility, which it says will allow its YuMi models and other automated machines to safely work in close proximity with human employees. ABB says its goal is to make the Shanghai facility the most advanced robotics factory in the world. It... Don't be surprised if the Google homepage looks a little different on your phone. As promised back in September, Google is rolling out its reworked Discover feed on google.com (so far, only for the US) for both Android and iOS devices. If you're in, you'll see a stream of cards below the search box that typically revolve around your interests, whether it's hot-button political issues, hobbies or a favorite team. You'll also find sports scores, YouTube carousels and similar cards to pique your interest. Unlike the old Feed, you can fine-tune Discover to show you more or less of a given topic... Logitech is giving select webcams the capabilities they need to be able to keep up with the times. The accessories-maker has released its new webcam software called Logitech Capture as a public beta for customers using its C920, C922 and BRIO 4K Pro Webcam models. While Logitech's current webcam software is good enough for video chats, its streaming capabilities are pretty basic. Capture was specifically designed for creators like vloggers who need access to more advanced features. The software gives those devices the ability to record from multiple sources, and it can act as a virtual came... BlizzCon is right around the corner, which means big tournaments are imminent -- and Blizzard unsurprisingly wants to be sure you can follow along. It just launched a Blizzard Esports app for Android and iOS that provides news, schedules, score and live viewing (including alerts) for competitive events in the developer's various franchises, such as the impending finale for the Overwatch World Cup. If you're stuck at work when the US team is taking on South Korea, you won't have to dig through news sites to get scores or tune in. The app is clearly meant to reel you in to Blizzard's game uni...

In 1787 Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni was premiered in Prague; in 1863 the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded (later to be called the Red Cross) was founded; in 1901 the Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom, the national co-ordinating body for air sport, was formed; in 1929 a selling panic started on the New York Stock Exchange, precipitating the Depression; in 1960, in his first professional fight, 18-year-old Cassius Clay, later to be known as Muhammad Ali, defeated his 30-year-old opponent, Tunney Hunsaker, on points; in 1964 the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar was renamed the United Republic of Tanzania. As winter starts to strike, badgers are preparing to keep themselves warm. They are dragging fresh material into their labyrinthine burrows, or setts, for bedding down in. They take in the dying bracken fronds and any straw they can find, and also plenty of autumn leaves that ferment and create a moist warmth in the burrow. Badgers come out to hunt at night all through the year, and rarely fall into a hibernatory sleep, but if it becomes very cold they may stay indoors for a while. They eat anything from earthworms to rabbits. There are usually five to ten badgers living in a sett, but a pair in which the female is pregnant will have a chamber of their own, and here she will give birth to two or three cubs in February or March. The cubs have silvery fur at first, but as they turn greyer they acquire the characteristic black and white head bands of adult badgers.

For the fans that came to see him, not the match or the teams, but him, the disappointment will be harder to shake. This will be the first Clasico without either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo since December 2007, when Julio Baptista's winner was the difference in a 1-0 win for Real Madrid.

The best way for Republicans to earn the votes of undecided voters is to clearly articulate how they would fix our broken health- care system. ObamaCare didn’t work. Republicans led boldly on tax reform, and they should do the same with health care reform. Americans deserve better protection than we are getting – and Congress must catch up fast. As we see record early voting across the country we are seeing numerous efforts in the last few weeks to make it more difficult for people to vote. A more ferociously partisan and dishonest leadership group is hard to imagine, all clinging to their life-raft of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Predictably, the establishment is blaming President Trump and his supporters for a climate of rage and hate. But let's be honest, a lot of Americans have had a lot to be angry about for an awfully long time. Elite bubble dwellers continue to fall hard for the illusion that the public trusts them to decide what matters most. Politicians in both parties need to clean up their own side of the street. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. David Lee Miller has the latest on the suspect who shot up a Pittsburgh synagogue. Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the man accused of opening fire Saturday inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 worshipers during the anti-Semitic rampage. Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania “has initiated the approval process” to seek the death penalty for 46-year-old Robert Bowers. “The ultimate decision regarding capital charges rests with the U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” Maimondi told Fox News in a statement. Bowers allegedly entered the Squirrel Hill area house of worship armed with an AR-15 rifle and three Glock handguns on Saturday morning, targeting three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Shabbat services. THE VICTIMS OF THE SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE During the deadly assault – that killed eight men and three women before a tactical police team tracked Bowers down and shot him – Bowers reportedly made several statements about his desire to kill Jews. Holding candles, a group of girls wait for the start of a memorial vigil at the intersection of Murray Ave. and Forbes Ave. in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh, for the victims of the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue where a shooter opened fire, killing multiple people and wounding others, including sevearl police officers. (AP) After his arrest, Bowers told one police officer: “They’re committing genocide against my people. I just want to kill Jews,” the criminal affidavit said. Six other people were injured in the attack, including four police officers. A law enforcement official said Bowers purchased all the weapons legally and had a license to carry. Officials released the names the 11 killed, all of them middle-aged or elderly. The victims included intellectually disabled brothers and a husband and wife. The youngest person was 54, and the oldest was 97 -- a Holocaust survivor. "The loss is incalculable," said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. Bowers faces 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in addition to 29 federal counts that include weapons offenses and hate crime charges. OPINION: I PRAYED AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE After the shooting, President Trump called for Bowers to get the death penalty. “People who do this should get the death penalty,” Trump said. “I think they should stiffen up laws and I think they should very much bring the death penalty to anybody who does a thing like this to innocent people.” He added: “They should really suffer the ultimate price — pay the ultimate price. I’ve felt this way for a very long time. People disagree with me, and I can’t imagine why.” Later Saturday, the president ordered flags be flown at half-staff at federal buildings in "solemn respect" for the synagogue shooting victims. The death penalty is legal in Pennsylvania, though current Gov. Tom Wolf halted the process when he took office in 2015. The last person executed under the death penalty in Pennsylvania was in 1999 -- which was the first execution in the state since 1962. Chris Hall, who lives next door to Bowers, described the suspected shooter as bland and “forgettable.” “I really wish there was some type of clue,” Hall told Fox News, adding his neighbor “felt more comfortable expressing his views online rather than in person. If I were to wave to him and he said, ‘All Jews must die’ or there was an SS sticker on his car, I would have f---ing reported him…but he didn’t do any of those things.” Hall said Bowers “felt more comfortable expressing his views online rather than in person. If I were to wave to him and he said, ‘All Jews must die’ or there was an SS sticker on his car, I would have f---ing reported him... but he didn’t do any of those things.” PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE SUSPECT BOWERS DESCRIBED AS BLAND BY UNSUSPECTING NEIGHBORS U.S. Attorney Scott Brady in Pittsburgh said Bowers was a long-haul trucker who worked for himself, and said little else is known at the time. It appears, however, that Bowers’ anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic views were front and center in his social media posts. Bowers used Gab -- a social media network billing itself as an alternative to Twitter that defends “liberty and free expression online” – to express himself. The network said it was cooperating with law enforcement after the Pittsburgh attack and "unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” Bowers, who underwent surgery and remained hospitalized, is scheduled to appear in court Monday. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf. Hall said he hasn’t slept since the massacre and worries there might be others who subscribe to the same hateful ideas and “hide in plain sight.” “I didn’t think anyone could be capable of something like this,” he said. “I’m still grappling with it. What if I had been more neighborly? But I don’t know. [The gunman] could have just as easily started [shooting] here. It’s a diverse neighborhood. It could have been target practice.” Fox News' Brooke Singman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

President Trump had strong words on the subject of religious persecution following Saturday’s deadly shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling the attack an “assault on humanity.” Speaking at a campaign rally for Illinois Rep. Mike Bost, Trump initially addressed the shooting inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania’s predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood. At least 11 people were killed when a gunman entered and opened fire. “This evil, anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It is an assault on humanity,” the president said, reiterating remarks he'd made about the episode earlier in the day. “It must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its ugly head. We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate.” “Those seeking their destruction, we will seek their destruction.” PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE PROVOKES OUTRAGE, ANGER AND CALLS TO ACTION Trump also doubled down on earlier calls to invoke the death penalty. “We must draw a line in the sand and say very strongly, never again.” Trump said he'd weighed the idea of canceling the rally and an earlier event in Indiana in light of the “horrible” shooting. “We can’t allow people like this to become important,” he said. Just before taking the stage, Trump again shared his condolences for what he called “the mass murder of Jewish Americans.” “We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries...,” his tweet read. Four officers were among the injured. Trump is on a rally blitz, hoping to bolster Republicans in Nov. 6 midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress.

People mourn in Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum during a community gathering held in the aftermath of Saturday's deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH – A survivor of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre described Sunday how he and other terrorized worshippers concealed themselves in a supply closet as the gunman stepped over the body of a man he had just shot and killed, entered their darkened hiding spot and looked around. "I can't say anything, and I'm barely breathing," recalled Barry Werber, 76, in an interview with The Associated Press. "He didn't see us, thank God." The gunman, Robert Gregory Bowers, opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons during worship services inside Tree of Life Synagogue, killing eight men and three women before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him, according to state and federal affidavits made public on Sunday. He expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and later told police that "all these Jews need to die," authorities said. Six people were injured in the attack, including four officers. Bowers targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of the city's Jewish community. As authorities worked to piece together Bowers' background and movements, harrowing accounts from the survivors began to emerge. Speaking at a vigil in Pittsburgh on Sunday night, Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said about a dozen people had gathered in the synagogue's main sanctuary when Bowers walked in and began shooting. He said seven of his congregants were killed. "My holy place has been defiled," he said. Officials released the names of all 11 of the dead, all of them middle-aged or elderly. The victims included intellectually disabled brothers and a husband and wife. The youngest was 54, and the oldest was 97. "The loss is incalculable," said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. Mayor Bill Peduto called it the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." Bowers shot his victims with an AR-15 — the weapon used in many of the nation's mass shootings — and three handguns, all of which he owned legally and had a license to carry, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation, and who spoke on Sunday on condition of anonymity. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady in Pittsburgh said Sunday night that federal prosecutors intend to pursue the death penalty against Bowers. Bowers was a long-haul trucker who worked for himself, Brady said. Little else was known about the suspect, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. It appears Bowers acted alone, authorities said. The victims included Melvin Wax, a retired accountant in his late 80s who was always one of the first to arrive at synagogue and among the last to leave. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other," said Myron Snider, a fellow member of New Light Congregation. "Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." The toll also included professors, dentists and physicians. Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his younger brother David Rosenthal, 54, were intellectually disabled and lived together in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, near the synagogue where they were killed. "Cecil's laugh was infectious. David was so kind and had such a gentle spirit. Together, they looked out for one another. They were inseparable," said Chris Schopf, vice president of residential supports for ACHIEVA, which helped the brothers live independently. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Bowers apparently posted an anti-Semitic message on a social media account linked to him just a few minutes before he opened fire during Sabbath services on Saturday morning. After the attack, he told an officer, "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit . In the basement, four members of New Light Congregation were just starting to pray — with two others in the kitchen — when they heard crashing sounds coming from upstairs, looked out the door and saw a body on the staircase, Werber, the survivor, recalled Sunday in an interview at his home. He said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman closed the door and pushed them into a large supply closet. As gunshots echoed upstairs, Werber called 911 but was afraid to say anything, for fear of making any noise. When the shots subsided, he said, Melvin Wax opened the door, only to be shot and fall back inside. "There were three shots, and he falls back into the room where we were," he said. "The gunman walks in." Apparently unable to see Werber and the other congregants in the darkness, Bowers walked back out. A day later, Werber called the gunman "a maniac" and "a person who has no control of his baser instincts." "I don't know why he thinks the Jews are responsible for all the ills in the world, but he's not the first and he won't be the last. Unfortunately, that's our burden to bear," Werber said. "It breaks my heart." The massacre came at a time of increasing anti-Semitism in the U.S. Earlier this year, the Anti-Defamation League reported a nearly 60 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 — the largest single-year increase since the ADL began its tracking nearly three decades ago. Perlman, who also spoke at the vigil Sunday night, said New Light lost three congregants. "These three men, they cannot be replaced," said Perlman, his voice breaking. "But we will not be broken. We will not be ruined." Bowers was charged with 11 state counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in what the leader of the Anti-Defamation League called the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. He was also charged in a 29-count federal criminal complaint that included counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death — a federal hate crime — and using a firearm to commit murder. Bowers, who underwent surgery and remained hospitalized, is scheduled to appear in court Monday. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf. A message left with the federal public defender's office in Pittsburgh wasn't immediately returned. Of the six survivors, four remained in the hospital Sunday night, and two — including a 40-year-old officer — were listed in critical condition. The nation's latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh in St. Peter's Square. "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence," he said. He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, and Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Robert Bowers allegedly shot and killed at least 10 people and wounded others at the Tree of Life Congregation, which was full of people at the time. Police said he entered the building, made the anti-Semitic declaration, opened fire, and then barricaded himself inside before he was taken into custody. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice plans to file federal hate crime charges against Bowers, as well as “other criminal charges.” “The Department of Justice will continue to support our state and local partners and we will continue to bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people,” Sessions said in a Saturday afternoon statement. While a motive hasn’t been made official, it’s clear from Bowers’ online persona that he was a racist who held a deep hatred for Jewish people. He was active on Gab, a social media platform popular among neo-Nazis, and regularly posted racist and anti-Jewish sentiments. His biography on the site said: “jews are the children of satan.” Less than two hours before the shooting, he railed against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in increasingly desperate posts, saying that he’d had enough of the “hostile invaders” and was “going in.” “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he wrote. His profile was taken down shortly after 11:30 a.m. But archives of his activity on the platform showed that he was an anti-Semite who was critical of President Trump for not being a true “nationalist,” and openly discussed the QAnon conspiracy theory, a dangerous, all-encompassing conspiracy web that started online and has since wormed its way into real life. He regularly reposted neo-Nazi content and openly lambasted diversity. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he wrote on Thursday. “#Qanon is here to get patriots that were against martial law in the 90′s to be the ones begging for it now to drain muh swamp.” He had also commented on the capture of Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested in Florida on Friday after allegedly sending more than a dozen explosive devices to various high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros. He poked fun at Sayoc’s garish van, which was covered in pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers, as well as conspiracy theories and memes. Gab released a statement after the shooting, saying that the site doesn’t allow for calls to violence: “Gab.com’s policy on terrorism and violence have always been very clear: we a have zero tolerance policy for it. Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. This has always been our policy. We are saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh and are keeping the families and friends of all victims in our thoughts and prayers.” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said authorities were still trying to learn the “extent of this anti-Semitic attack.” “We are devastated,” he wrote on Twitter. “Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community.” This story has been updated with a statement from Jeff Sessions.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims_us_5bd4bb77e4b0a8f17ef85213---split---Eight men and three women, ranging in age from 97 to 54, were killed at a crowded Pittsburgh synagogue when a gunman opened fire on the congregation during Saturday services, officials announced. Allegheny County medical examiner Karl Williams named the victims at a news conference Sunday: Fienberg, a mother of two sons, leaves behind several grandchildren, reported The Associated Press. Before she retired in 2008, she was a longtime researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center. “Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being,” Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, Fienberg’s former research partner, told the AP. “She was the gentlest of people,” according to Dodie Roskies, one of her best friends. Gottfried, a dentist was remembered by many for his devotion to his wider community. He spent years performing dental work on people who were uninsured at the Squirrel Hill Health Center. “He was very devoted to community and to service,” said Susan Kalson, the center’s chief executive. “He loved working with our patients, underserved patients, including a lot of refugees and immigrants.” Mallinger was a mainstay at the synagogue for decades. “She was a synagogue-goer, and not everybody is. She’s gone to the synagogue for a lifetime, no matter how many people are there,” Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at the synagogue, told The Washington Post. Rabinowitz was a doctor, cat lover and “the kindest person you could dream of meeting,” his friend, Anna Boswell-Levy, said in a Facebook post. “He was such a good and caring man,” added Lisa Wesson-Richardson, one of his employees at UPMC Shadyside, where he was a family practitioner. “This is such huge loss to his family, his staff and his patients!” “The UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss,” the hospital said in a statement. Several people recalled the role Rabinowitz played in saving the lives of loved ones. Former patient Michael Kerr, who Rabinowitz treated for HIV until 2004, said he would be remembered in the community for “keeping us alive the longest.” He was never seen without a bowtie, which his nephew Avishal Ostrin said he wore to “make people smile:” Tree of Life was an integral part of these brothers’ lives, friends said. They lived apart, but were “inseparable” and both sought care for their developmental disabilities from the same organization, Achieva. “You can feel what is good in the world when you talk to them, because they only talk to you about good things,” Jeffrey Solomon, a fellow Tree of Life congregant, told The New York Times. “To say that everyone in the Pittsburgh Jewish community knows them is not even a remote exaggeration. They were both active participants in so much of life.” Their sister, Diane Rosenthal, praised her brothers and their fellow congregants as “the ones who kept this community going, who made things happen.” They probably even greeted the suspect on the morning of the shooting, she added. “They held hands and they always smiled, and he would open the door for her, all those things that you want from another person,” recalled Heather Graham, the couple’s neighbor. “They were really generous and nice to everybody.” Graham used to shovel snow for the Simons, and in return Bernice Simon would bake cranberry orange bread for Graham and write a thank-you note. Stein, a retired plumbing salesman and substitute teacher, as well as a husband, father of two and grandfather of one, attended Shabbat services every Saturday morning, his nephew, Steven Halle, told WPXI News on Saturday. “Everybody loved him, there wasn’t one person that didn’t like him in the community,” Halle said. Wax, a retired accountant, was “such a kind, kind person,” Myron Snider, chairman of the congregation’s cemetery committee, told the AP. “When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them,” Snider said. He was so active within the synagogue that a friend jokingly described his role to The New York Times as “everything but the cantor.” Younger’s two greatest loves were his faith and his family, according to his next-door neighbor Tina Prizner. The former small business owner and baseball coach attended services every day, volunteering as an usher. “He was the most wonderful dad and grandpa,” Prizner added. “He talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody.” Williams said that the victims’ families had been notified and are “in shock and grieving.” Their bodies are undergoing autopsies, and authorities are “doing everything in our power that honors both civil and religious law,” he said. It could take up to a week to finish processing the crime scene, given that bodies were found in three different locations, Williams said. “There are shell casings everywhere,” he said. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die,” before carrying out the attack, according to police sources. Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges against him on Saturday evening, 22 of which could result in him being sentenced to death. Bowers brought three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault-style rifle into the synagogue, all of which he used in the massacre, Williams said. He’s expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. A Torah study and Shabbat services were scheduled at the synagogue on Saturday. During the shooting, a bris ― a Jewish circumcision ceremony for an infant boy ― was reportedly taking place at the synagogue. Six people, including four police officers, were injured. One officer has been released from hospitalization and officials said a second was to be released sometime on Sunday. The Anti-Defamation League called the shooting “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” Hayley Miller contributed reporting. This article has been updated with additional details on victims.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Former FBI special agent Maureen O’Connell weighs in. Like millions of people around the world, I was horrified when I first heard about the mass shooting Saturday at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that resulted in the deaths of 11 people and left six wounded. Officials said Robert Bowers was arrested and charged with 29 criminal counts in connection with the mass killing. The attack on the synagogue came a day after authorities arrested Cesar Sayoc in connection with the mailing of pipe bombs to former and current Democratic officials – including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Eric Holder and two U.S. senators – along with other prominent critics of President Trump, plus CNN. Thankfully, the bombs did not go off and no one was hurt. The arguments today we now hear from both the right and the left are the same ones we hear after every mass shooting. Many people on the left call for stricter gun control, including banning weapons such as the AR-15-style assault rifle used in the Pittsburgh shooting. (As an aside, I agree with banning the AR-15, but that is for a different column). Many people on the right support the position of President Trump, who said Saturday: "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him,” referring to the gunman. Our minds are filled with hatred – whether it be from what we watch on television, listen to on radio and in podcasts, or read in news stories and opinion pieces. Many conservatives also want teachers to carry firearms and see more armed people in places of worship and elsewhere to defend against criminals. But the arguments about guns don’t address what is behind all of these attacks: hate. Sayoc, the alleged pipe bomber, reportedly hated people who spoke out against President Trump. His lawyer said that Sayoc looked to the president as a father figure. His van was plastered with pictures of targets on faces of people who have criticized the president. The social media accounts of Bowers reportedly suggested he hated Jews, immigrants, refugees, politicians and “invaders.” In the past, when we have suffered attacks, or feel like we are in danger of being attacked, President Trump and many of his supporters have sought to impose bans on people entering the U.S. Ban all Muslims, ban Syrian refugees, ban people coming from Central America in the caravan. The list goes on. We talk a lot about banning and I believe it stems not only from fear, but from our hatred of those we perceive to be different from ourselves, or even as evil. There are Americans who even attend rallies where hate of certain groups is applauded. Our minds are filled with hatred – whether it be from what we watch on television, listen to on radio and in podcasts, or read in news stories and opinion pieces. Our talking heads, journalists, talk show hosts, politicians and even our president spew hate. This constant rhetoric of hatred, of exclusion and of banning is circulated in our minds. So we can ban guns, we can ban people who are a certain religion or come from a certain country. But if we don’t address the root of the anger, I fear the attacks will continue – whether with a knife, a gun or a bomb. We need to take a deep look in the mirror, America. We need to stop screaming about bans, which alone will not fix this problem we have as a very angry and divided and, dare I say, hateful nation. We need to change. The change begins within each of us. We need to stop hating each other. If only we could ban that. We need to ban hate.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mocks-crazed-stumbling-lunatic-tom-steyer-after-billionaire-rips-presidents-rhetoric---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Insight from Ned Ryun, former writer for President George W. Bush. President Trump derided rival billionaire Tom Steyer as a "wacky" and "crazed & stumbling lunatic" on Sunday, after Steyer -- who was one of the prominent liberals to receive a threatening suspicious package last week -- said he "absolutely was blaming" Trump for creating an atmosphere in which "anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up." Steyer fired back quickly, writing that Trump's comment was "unthinkable ... in the midst of the horrible political violence." The Twitter conflagration erupted after Steyer's wide-ranging interview with CNN's "State of the Union," in which the hedge fund manager called Trump "corrupt," and accused him of "the most abject dereliction of duty in the history of the country" by "willingly putting Americans in harm's way" because he has dismissed a major United Nations report on global climate change. Tom Steyer, seen here, said: "If you look across the political scene, what you see is routine, systematic lawlessness. ... We see it in a president who has been breaking the law systematically." (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Steyer not only appeared to implicate the president's rhetoric in the suspected explosive devices allegedly mailed by Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc to top liberal figures, including Steyer, but also in the deadly mass shooting by gunman Robert Gregory Bowers at a synagogue on Saturday. Bowers regularly posted anti-Trump and anti-Semitic comments on social media. "I think his response to the tragedy [Saturday] was appropriate, but there's something much bigger than that going on here, which is the atmosphere that he's created -- and that the Republican Party has created -- in terms of political violence," Steyer said. "If you look across the political scene, what you see is routine, systematic lawlessness. ... We see it in a president who has been breaking the law systematically, as a candidate, as a businessman, and as a president." Steyer charged that Trump wants to undermine "the laws of the United States" and conduct an "attack on the rule of law," although he stopped short of saying Trump was directly responsible for any physical acts of violence. ETHICS COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST DEMOCRATIC REP. MAXINE WATERS AFTER SHE ENCOURAGES SUPPORTERS TO 'PUSH' ON REPUBLICANS IN PUBLIC Tapper pointed out that last year, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was nearly killed when a left-wing gunman shot him and two others with a rifle at a GOP congressional baseball practice. And earlier this month, a Utah man was arrested and accused of attempting to send a crude form of the poison ricin to Trump and to the Pentagon. "I would say there has been bad behavior on both sides," Steyer conceded, although he went on to characterize Tapper's remarks as a "false equivalence" because, he said, Republicans behaved significantly worse. "You can't find prominent Democrats who are leading chants with violent overtones. ... all the kinds of attempts to play to people's strongest emotions." TOP DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SLAMS CLINTON'S CALL TO ABANDON CIVILITY WITH GOP: 'RIDICULOUS' Steyer also told host Jake Tapper it was a "straight-up anti-Semitic move" for Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to post a since-deleted warning that prominent liberal donors, including Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, and George Soros, were attempting to "buy" the 2018 elections. (Bloomberg and Soros are Jewish, and Steyer's late father was Jewish.) McCarthy deleted the tweet before Saturday's shooting, and his spokesman has said the congressman "has and will always condemn in the strongest possible way violence or any acts of attempted violence." The tweet initially attracted criticism because it was posted after an apparent explosive device was found at Soros' suburban New York compound. But Steyer said the post was a "classic attempt to separate Americans" and constitutes "political violence," even though Steyer added it would be inappropriate to speculate on what was going through McCarthy's mind. RAND PAUL WARNS OF ASSASSINATION PERIL IN DC: 'I WORRY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED' The wealthy philanthropist has spent tens of millions of dollars on advertisements calling for Trump's impeachment and removal. Hours after the shooting on Saturday, he wrote on Twitter, "Innocent people are dead and the atmosphere is poisonous. We need a change from the top down." Trump unloaded on Steyer after the interview aired, offering not only a nickname for him, but also a quick assessment of his prospective chances in the upcoming Democratic presidential primary. "Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper," Trump wrote on Twitter. "He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!" DEMS POISED TO MAKE HISTORIC IMPEACHMENT PUSH AFTER MIDTERMS Steyer concluded his interview with Tapper by promising to "keep going" in his effort to impeach and remove Trump from office. "I think it is really important, if we're going to have a more positive 21st century as an American century, that we not only oppose what's wrong, but stand up for what's right," Steyer said. "If you actually look at what Americans think, almost 80 percent of registered Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office," he added. "If you ask Americans broadly -- Democrats, Republicans and Independents -- more people are in favor of that than aren't. ... What we have is a movement asking for a different America."

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. After Saturday's mass shooting, Pittsburghers are turning to one of the city's best unifiers to help the community recover: black and gold. PITTSBURGH – No matter the corner of Pittsburgh, the city’s 300,000 people share two things in common: black and gold. “Not only is it a city that loves sports, people say it’s a family,” said Brian Hutchinson, a Pittsburgh sports fan. Pittsburgh Steelers fans stand for a moment of silence for the victims of a deadly shooting spree at a synagogue on Saturday before the start of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Those colors — representing the steel city’s football, ice hockey and baseball professional teams — carry Pittsburghers through ups and downs, including Saturday’s mass shooting that left 11 dead and six injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Despite the weekend’s tragedy, tens of thousands of fans poured into Heinz stadium just more than 24 hours later — full of smiles, laughter and, of course, booze. “You never stop life and love in the face of evil,” said Hutchinson. “We are a family. That was never exemplified more than today in the aftermath of this tragedy in Squirrel Hill.” Yinzers, like Hutchinson, sought refuge at Sunday’s Steelers game — away from the community’s utter loss. “You can’t let the hate get you down, you have to come together,” Ashley Senopole said, before tightly hugging a loved one. Fellow fan Amber Biscella agreed. “I think it’s not about our differences now, it’s really about how we’re all the same,” she told Fox News. Fan after fan emphasized how close the Pittsburgh community is, including Squirrel Hill resident Hutchinson. He said he did not know any of the victims personally, but added, “Any of us are only a relationship removed from something like that in this town.” The feeling of unity and love underscored by fans spilled over from the stands onto the field, with players also offering condolences to families of the victims. A hush fell over Heinz Field Sunday just before kickoff in a moment of silence, commemorating the lives lost. Steelers President Art Rooney II released a statement saying, in part, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." Professional athletes — boasting the black and gold — echoed these sentiments on Twitter. Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster wrote, “My prayers goes out to families of the victims, everyone in the city of Pittsburgh, and the Jewish-American community, I can’t believe the news. Stay strong #PittsburghSynagogueShooting.” Pittsburgh’s ice hockey and baseball teams chimed in as well. Penguins’ Matt Murray tweeted, “Love is stronger than hate and we won't let this tragedy tear us down. My heart is with Pittsburgh. #StrongerThanHate.” The Pirates’ starting pitcher, Jameson Taillon, wrote, “My heart seriously hurts for Pittsburgh and all of the innocent people that have been affected. #PittsburghStrong.” Many tweets were partnered with an image — a spinoff of the Steelers’ logo, featuring the Star of David and the text, “#StrongerThanHate,” printed in a Boston font as a nod to that city’s comeback from the marathon bombing. "Every share of [the logo] is something that is an act of love in my mind and something that is trying to diminish hate,” said Tim Hindes, the creator of the now viral image. “And for that, that makes me greatly proud.” Hindes added it’s not a complex shape or anything “all that creative,” but he said that’s the point. “Pittsburgh people are innovative, but we’re simple people too.” Simple, like the message fans were sending Sunday: “We are proud of the fact that we’re a big family. It’s not cliché. We really do care for one another — black, white, young and old, we’re a family.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-navy-man-shot-20181028-story.html---split---A 21-year-old man was arrested Saturday in connection with the fatal shooting of a good Samaritan who stopped to assist a seemingly stranded motorist on Interstate 15, San Diego police said Sunday. Brandon Acuna was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and burglary, said San Diego police Lt. Anthony Dupree. He declined to offer any further details, except to say that others may have been involved in the shooting. Curtis Adams, 21, an active-duty member of the Navy, was driving with his girlfriend south on the freeway when they spotted a man standing next to a white vehicle on the shoulder near the northbound Interstate 5 on-ramp in Logan Heights about 2:20 a.m., Dupree said. The couple pulled over to help, and Adams was shot as he exited his vehicle, Dupree said. The shooter got back in his vehicle and fled south. Soon after, the California Highway Patrol put out an alert that a similar vehicle was stopped on northbound Interstate 5 near 32nd Street. A man was also seen walking away from the vehicle. Officers found the man on Newton Street, later identified as Acuna, and he was taken into custody, police said. Investigators also believe that Acuna was involved in an attempted car burglary on Boundary Street in the community of Mt. Hope about 10 minutes before the fatal shooting, police said. Detectives are working to determine if another individual was involved in the attempted burglary.        5:05 p.m.: This article was updated with new information from police.

---split---3.0---split---https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/10/29/three-things-to-know-the-1-5-wizards-are-worse-than-you-think/---split---LOS ANGELES — Every day in the NBA there is a lot to unpack, so every weekday morning throughout the season we will give you the three things you need to know from the last 24 hours in the NBA. 1) The 1-5 Wizards are worse than you think. Watch the Wizards play and what is wrong grows more and more obvious. It’s not the defense — although it’s terrible, the Wizards are allowing 114.5 points per 100 possessions this season (26th in the NBA and 6.9 worse than they gave up last season). It’s not their three-point shooting, although the Wizards are hitting just 31 percent from three as a team. It wasn’t even that the Wizards got blown out by the Clippers 136-104 Sunday night. It’s not the statistics at all. Watch Washington in person and the team’s lack of chemistry is painfully obvious: • When Bradley Beal slipped and went to the floor in the second half, it was Clipper Tobias Harris who helped him up because no Wizard teammate came over to. There were two other similar instances I noticed Sunday night where the Clipper player helped a Wizards player off the floor because teammates did not rush over to do so. • When the Wizards took the court to start the game there was almost no interaction among players — Otto Porter was talking to the referee because that was the only person willing to talk to him. • Clippers players seemed to be more concerned when Markieff Morris went down with an elbow to the face than the Wizards (Morris left the game with a concussion). The Wizards are clearly playing for themselves and not each other, not the team. “That was the first thing Scotty [Brooks, Wizards’ coach] said after the game,” Clippers’ coach Doc Rivers said. “He said, ‘Man, your guys are just, watching them, you just feel the energy and you just feel them. They get along.” Washington’s John Wall and Bradley Beal have spoken before about guys playing for themselves and their stats, not sacrificing for the team, and that theme — on the court and in the locker room — carried over into Sunday. “Just gotta go out there and compete,” John Wall said. “We play like a team that’s 5-1 and people are just going to lay down, we got to play with a sense of urgency that we’re 1-5 now…. “When you play the game of basketball you can’t worry about how many points you got, how many steals you got, how many assists you got, it’s just competing.” Beyond the chemistry, of all the on-court problems, nothing is going to change until the defense improves. “Our defense is horrendous…” Austin Rivers said. “You’ve got to have personal pride. You’ve got to get mad when someone scores on you. We’re not the Warriors.” “Just heart. Just heart and pride,” Wall said of what it will take to fix the defense. “Guard your man one-on-one, that’s really the main key. We gotta do a better job of switching — when we do do that, like we did in the first quarter, I think we played the best we have played for a while.” The switching trend in the NBA is giving the Wizards problems on both ends. “On offense when we get (a switch we like), we take a bad shot sometimes and bail those guys out,” Wall said. “When they put us in bad situations, we gamble too much or don’t stay on the play and get a stop… we do a good job of it in practice, but we have to bring the same competitive edge we have competing against each other in practice to playing someone else.” Washington’s play is ugly and coach Scott Brooks could pay the price with his job if things don’t improve. He certainly is not faultless in all this. However, the Wizards have changed coaches before. They have changed players around on the periphery then spun it as trying to fix chemistry issues (Marcin Gortat going to the Clippers is the latest along those lines). Everything changes except the core, and yet the same problem exists. Which means maybe it’s getting to be time for the Wizards to take a fresh look at that core and if it works. 2) Does firing of Tyronn Lue mean Cavaliers realize it’s time to go all-in on the rebuild? Last July, when LeBron James decided to head west, the Cavaliers brain trust decided to pivot to… nobody is sure what exactly. They wanted to walk the very fine line of a rebuild on the fly — compete now while building for the future — and they fell off that tightrope. This isn’t a team built to win now, not with Kevin Love leading an aging roster constructed to support LeBron — Tristan Thompson, George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver. They are not a group built to create great looks and rack up wins on their own. There’s a reason Vegas set the under/over on wins for the Cavaliers this season at 31.5. It’s also not a rebuild in Cleveland. How many players on the Cavaliers are younger than 25? Four. Just four — Collin Sexton, Ante Zizic, Cedi Osman, and Sam Dekker. Guys we think of as young — Larry Nance Jr., Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood — are all 26 and closer to their prime, and they all come with questions. Sunday Lue paid the price for a 0-6 start and a sense among the front office in Cleveland they needed to go another direction, a coach better suited to a young team (even if the Cavs are not yet htat). That start, however, was not about Lue. It’s about a team in limbo. The Cavaliers need to pick a path. Rebuilding would make the most sense. Play Colin Sexton more and live with the at times painful learning process. He’s got real potential, but he’s still adjusting to the speed of the NBA and settles for far too many long twos. More importantly, it’s time to start working to trade the veterans and getting pieces for a rebuild back (picks and prospects). There will a market at the deadline for Kyle Korver — a shooter on a fair contract, $7.6 million this season and with a $3.4 million buyout for next season. George Hill is overpaid this season ($19 million) but he is a solid point guard when healthy and come the deadline there could be teams willing to take the hit this season knowing he has a $1 million buyout next season. J.R. Smith, at $14.7 million this season (with a $3.9 million buyout next season) will be harder to move because, without LeBron, teams are not sure how much he will help them. Love is the big piece to move, but with his new contract it’s a lot harder. That is probably a next summer move — but it’s one they need to start moving toward. 3) Oklahoma City gets first win of the season. When you’re busting out of a slump, you don’t care where and how it happens. So what if the Phoenix Suns were on the second night of a back-to-back? Who cares if they didn’t have Devin Booker? What matters is Paul George and Russell Westbrook scored 23 points a piece and the Thunder got their first win of the season, 117-110. Westbrook was doing Westbrook things all night. Also, don’t sleep on Nerlens Noel, who had 20 points and 15 boards. OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Thunder didn’t care that Phoenix had just one win this season, was playing the second game of a back-to-back and was missing its leading scorer. They just wanted to get a win. Oklahoma City finally broke through for the first time in five tries this season. Paul George and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 points, and the Thunder beat the Suns 117-110 on Sunday. “It feels special,” guard Dennis Schroder said. “I think we can build off of that win. We’re going to keep getting better. It was a good one tonight.” Nerlens Noel had 20 points and 15 rebounds and Patrick Patterson added 17 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City’s victory left the Cleveland Cavaliers, who fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday, as the league’s only winless team. Thunder center Steven Adams did not play after experiencing tightness in his left calf during pregame warmups, and Noel started in his place. Coach Billy Donovan was pleased with the way Noel performed in his first start. “He did a lot of really good things,” Donovan said. “He was really, really active. He was very active defensively. He scored some points on some lobs and some rolls and he got to the free-throw line. I was really, really impressed with his defense.” Noel has started 159 of his 228 career games, so he was comfortable in the role. “Just do this on a nightly basis, just being a professional, ready for whatever is thrown at me in this position,” he said. “Steven wasn’t able to go, so I just kept the same mindset of being able to be ready, no matter what. I knew if I was coming off the bench, if I was starting, I’d play the same way. That’s about it.” Rookie Elie Okobo scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton added 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Devin Booker, who entered the day as the league’s ninth-best scorer at 27.8 points per game, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. The Thunder led 62-48 at halftime after shooting 49 percent from the field. George scored 15 points before the break, while Westbrook made just two field goals. The Thunder blew a 14-point halftime lead against Boston on Thursday, so the threat of falling apart still was there. Westbrook hit back-to-back layups to make it 82-65 in the third. George drained a shot from just beyond half court at the third-quarter buzzer to put Oklahoma City up 96-76. “It’s one of the funnest basketball games I’ve played in since I’ve been here,” Noel said. “Guys just play so unselfish. This team is really built the right way. Guys just want to make winning plays, and everybody is going to excel when the play style is like that.” Phoenix outscored the Thunder 34-21 in the fourth quarter. “A lot of positives in the game,” Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. “You’re not going to feel better – we lost the game. But effort was there. I think we tried, and we tried for 48 minutes.”  You can buy a pair of Russell Westbrook‘s Air Jordan “Why Not?” ZER0.1 on the Nike site for $80. Or, you can trade him for a slice of pizza. A young Thunder fan considered it pregame, but wouldn’t give up the slice.

The Thunder also picked up their first win of the season, 117-110 against Phoenix. NEW YORK (AP) — Golden State appeared on its way to another easy victory when the game suddenly turned into a 3-point shootout. Luckily for the Warriors, they have the perfect guy for that. Stephen Curry set another NBA record by making seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points as the Warriors held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 120-114 on Sunday. Kevin Durant added 34 for the Warriors, who were coasting before the Nets made it close with some sizzling shooting behind the arc. Curry finally turned them back when his final 3-pointer made it 115-108 with 1:07 to play. He has made at least five 3s in all seven games, breaking George McCloud’s record of six games in a row during the 1995-96 season. “They got hot in the fourth to try to make it interesting, but made enough plays down the stretch to obviously get the win,” Curry said. Klay Thompson continued to struggle behind the arc, going 1 for 5 and falling to 5 for 36 this season. He finished with 18 points and still hasn’t had a 20-point outing this season. D'Angelo Russell scored 25 points and Caris LeVert had 23 for the Nets, who made 20 3-pointers in 42 attempts and cut a 19-point deficit down to two. “I think the 3-pointer got them back in the game and ended up we had to play a little bit and execute down the stretch, so it was a solid outing for us,” Durant said. Golden State has won four in a row since its lone loss and the previous three were all by at least 20 points. The franchise record is four straight 20-point victories, set by the San Francisco Warriors in 1966-67, and it appeared the Warriors were going to equal that. Curry scored 16 points in the first quarter. The Nets hung close until midway through the second, and another 3 by Curry pushed it to 63-44 with 1:55 remaining in the half. “The way the first half went we easily could have kind of folded and that’s not what kind of guys we have in that locker room,” Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. “They’re a resilient bunch and I thought they competed their tails off and it was good for the fans to see that we didn’t just succumb to their talent or their aura so to speak.” Draymond Green had a season-high 13 assists. Tyronn Lue is out in Cleveland, the scapegoat for an organization trying to walk an impossibly-fine line of rebuilding while winning (with a roster that really does neither well). While the Cavaliers were not playing well, when you remove the best player of a generation and the guy who set the culture for the organization, what was there to expect? The Cavaliers want Larry Drew — an assistant on Lue’s staff and former NBA head coach — to take the job on an interim basis. Drew, however, is savvy enough to know better than to just say yes. Larry Drew is willing to bridge the immediate coaching transition with Cavaliers, but so far is reluctant to commit to rest of season without an agreement of some kind that extends beyond 2018-19, league sources tell ESPN. Those talks are ongoing with Cleveland. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) October 28, 2018  Sources on @TheAthleticNBA @WatchStadium: Larry Drew hasn't agreed to take interim head coach title with Cleveland, but will continue as voice of head coach as team could look to assess their options. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 28, 2018  That’s smart by Drew. Whoever takes that job will be stuck in the same morass as Lue. The Cavaliers want to think of themselves as a rebuilding team, but they have just four players under 25 on the roster (and only two of those are likely part of the long-term in Cleveland). The veterans are going to be on the trade block, and guys like Kevin Love are good when healthy but his time will be limited. It’s not a no-win situation, but no coach is going to pad his stats taking over this roster mid-season. Drew, wisely, wants to be compensated for this. We’ll see if that happens, or if the Cavs go get someone else.
---split---3.0---split---https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/10/28/cavaliers-fire-coach-tyronn-lue-after-0-6-start/---split---Tyronn Lue was LeBron James‘ hand-picked guy. David Blatt was out and Lue was in and that was how LeBron wanted it in Cleveland. LeBron is no longer in Cleveland. Now, neither is Tyronn Lue thanks to owner Dan Gilbert’s quick trigger, a story broken by Shams Charania of The Athletic. Cavs‘ roster has been informed of firing of Ty Lue, per league sources. Lue has been let go as Cavs head coach after 0-6 start to Cleveland’s season. https://t.co/b50Nxh91Br — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 28, 2018  Ty Lue went 128-83 over three years as Cavaliers head coach, helped guiding team to 2016 championship and three consecutive Finals trips. Cavaliers front office is meeting with assistant Larry Drew now as possible interim coach. https://t.co/b50Nxh91Br — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 28, 2018  Lue confirmed the firing and released this statement. Tyronn Lue statement obtained by @espn @TheUndefeated pic.twitter.com/Cj7JdsYS12 — Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpearsESPN) October 28, 2018  The Cavaliers also confirmed the move. “This was a very difficult decision. It is especially so, considering Coach Lue’s time with us over the last four years, including four straight trips to the NBA Finals,” said GM Koby Altman in a released statement. “We have respect and great admiration for Ty, not only as a coach, but a person. We thank him for the many ways he has contributed to our success, wish him the best and he will always be remembered for leading a very special Cavs team back against the odds to win the title in 2016. This is a different team equation, though, and one that we felt needed a different voice and approach that required this change.” Larry Drew is the interim coach, although how long that lasts remains to be seen. The Cavs will want him to play the youth and that means losses, he knows he needs to be well compensated and get some security to do that. Drew is a long-time assistant who was the head coach of the Atlanta Hawks for four seasons from 2010-14 plus the head coach in Milwaukee for a short time. The Cavs let go of other assistant coaches and all, including Drew, are on one year contracts. LeBron James and new franchise centerpiece Kevin Love have Lue’s back — speaking for a lot of current Cavs players who are not happy with the move. T Lue thanks for the memories and more importantly our partnership bringing a 🏆 to that deserved city/fan base. U know how to find me 🙏🏾 — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 28, 2018    You helped me see the big picture. Life changing experiences and teaching points. Nothing but love and admiration. Know we will work towards something greater together again. THANK YOU. 🏆 A post shared by @ kevinlove on Oct 28, 2018 at 8:31am PDT No doubt Cleveland has looked like the worst team in the NBA to start the young season, with the second-worst defense and 23rd-ranked offense in the league. They have been outscored by 12.6 points per 100 possessions through six games, trailed by at least 16 in every game, and haven’t shown much competitive fire. Is that really Lue’s fault? The team lost the player that carried them to the Finals, the person that was their team culture, the man the entire roster was built around. Then this summer they didn’t revamp the roster with any kind of direction in mind other than walking the nearly impossible line of rebuilding while winning. While he’s not considered an Xs and Os guru by his peers, Lue is considered a hard-working coach who got a team to a ring with some smart moves. He’s a player’s coach, but only can do so much. Lue is a coach given a misfit roster that was never going to transition smoothly. Some in the Cleveland front office thought could compete for a playoff spot, an idea that drew laughs from most observers. Management thought this team should have been more competitive. Still, the front office was full of mixed signals. They paid big money to Kevin Love this summer — a $120 million contract extension — despite his age and injury history. Love has been fine this season, 19.5 points and 13 rebounds a game, when healthy enough to play, but the roster around him is not going to fit well with his game. What should have been a rebuild after LeBron left has become a team that is neither win now or rebuilding. And it shows. That’s more about Dan Gilbert and his ownership/leadership, which is going to be exposed even more in the coming years. But Lue takes the hit. Welcome to the NBA. LOS ANGELES — Every day in the NBA there is a lot to unpack, so every weekday morning throughout the season we will give you the three things you need to know from the last 24 hours in the NBA. 1) The 1-5 Wizards are worse than you think. Watch the Wizards play and what is wrong grows more and more obvious. It’s not the defense — although it’s terrible, the Wizards are allowing 114.5 points per 100 possessions this season (26th in the NBA and 6.9 worse than they gave up last season). It’s not their three-point shooting, although the Wizards are hitting just 31 percent from three as a team. It wasn’t even that the Wizards got blown out by the Clippers 136-104 Sunday night. It’s not the statistics at all. Watch Washington in person and the team’s lack of chemistry is painfully obvious: • When Bradley Beal slipped and went to the floor in the second half, it was Clipper Tobias Harris who helped him up because no Wizard teammate came over to. There were two other similar instances I noticed Sunday night where the Clipper player helped a Wizards player off the floor because teammates did not rush over to do so. • When the Wizards took the court to start the game there was almost no interaction among players — Otto Porter was talking to the referee because that was the only person willing to talk to him. • Clippers players seemed to be more concerned when Markieff Morris went down with an elbow to the face than the Wizards (Morris left the game with a concussion). The Wizards are clearly playing for themselves and not each other, not the team. “That was the first thing Scotty [Brooks, Wizards’ coach] said after the game,” Clippers’ coach Doc Rivers said. “He said, ‘Man, your guys are just, watching them, you just feel the energy and you just feel them. They get along.” Washington’s John Wall and Bradley Beal have spoken before about guys playing for themselves and their stats, not sacrificing for the team, and that theme — on the court and in the locker room — carried over into Sunday. “Just gotta go out there and compete,” John Wall said. “We play like a team that’s 5-1 and people are just going to lay down, we got to play with a sense of urgency that we’re 1-5 now…. “When you play the game of basketball you can’t worry about how many points you got, how many steals you got, how many assists you got, it’s just competing.” Beyond the chemistry, of all the on-court problems, nothing is going to change until the defense improves. “Our defense is horrendous…” Austin Rivers said. “You’ve got to have personal pride. You’ve got to get mad when someone scores on you. We’re not the Warriors.” “Just heart. Just heart and pride,” Wall said of what it will take to fix the defense. “Guard your man one-on-one, that’s really the main key. We gotta do a better job of switching — when we do do that, like we did in the first quarter, I think we played the best we have played for a while.” The switching trend in the NBA is giving the Wizards problems on both ends. “On offense when we get (a switch we like), we take a bad shot sometimes and bail those guys out,” Wall said. “When they put us in bad situations, we gamble too much or don’t stay on the play and get a stop… we do a good job of it in practice, but we have to bring the same competitive edge we have competing against each other in practice to playing someone else.” Washington’s play is ugly and coach Scott Brooks could pay the price with his job if things don’t improve. He certainly is not faultless in all this. However, the Wizards have changed coaches before. They have changed players around on the periphery then spun it as trying to fix chemistry issues (Marcin Gortat going to the Clippers is the latest along those lines). Everything changes except the core, and yet the same problem exists. Which means maybe it’s getting to be time for the Wizards to take a fresh look at that core and if it works. 2) Does firing of Tyronn Lue mean Cavaliers realize it’s time to go all-in on the rebuild? Last July, when LeBron James decided to head west, the Cavaliers brain trust decided to pivot to… nobody is sure what exactly. They wanted to walk the very fine line of a rebuild on the fly — compete now while building for the future — and they fell off that tightrope. This isn’t a team built to win now, not with Kevin Love leading an aging roster constructed to support LeBron — Tristan Thompson, George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver. They are not a group built to create great looks and rack up wins on their own. There’s a reason Vegas set the under/over on wins for the Cavaliers this season at 31.5. It’s also not a rebuild in Cleveland. How many players on the Cavaliers are younger than 25? Four. Just four — Collin Sexton, Ante Zizic, Cedi Osman, and Sam Dekker. Guys we think of as young — Larry Nance Jr., Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood — are all 26 and closer to their prime, and they all come with questions. Sunday Lue paid the price for a 0-6 start and a sense among the front office in Cleveland they needed to go another direction, a coach better suited to a young team (even if the Cavs are not yet htat). That start, however, was not about Lue. It’s about a team in limbo. The Cavaliers need to pick a path. Rebuilding would make the most sense. Play Colin Sexton more and live with the at times painful learning process. He’s got real potential, but he’s still adjusting to the speed of the NBA and settles for far too many long twos. More importantly, it’s time to start working to trade the veterans and getting pieces for a rebuild back (picks and prospects). There will a market at the deadline for Kyle Korver — a shooter on a fair contract, $7.6 million this season and with a $3.4 million buyout for next season. George Hill is overpaid this season ($19 million) but he is a solid point guard when healthy and come the deadline there could be teams willing to take the hit this season knowing he has a $1 million buyout next season. J.R. Smith, at $14.7 million this season (with a $3.9 million buyout next season) will be harder to move because, without LeBron, teams are not sure how much he will help them. Love is the big piece to move, but with his new contract it’s a lot harder. That is probably a next summer move — but it’s one they need to start moving toward. 3) Oklahoma City gets first win of the season. When you’re busting out of a slump, you don’t care where and how it happens. So what if the Phoenix Suns were on the second night of a back-to-back? Who cares if they didn’t have Devin Booker? What matters is Paul George and Russell Westbrook scored 23 points a piece and the Thunder got their first win of the season, 117-110. Westbrook was doing Westbrook things all night. Also, don’t sleep on Nerlens Noel, who had 20 points and 15 boards. OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Thunder didn’t care that Phoenix had just one win this season, was playing the second game of a back-to-back and was missing its leading scorer. They just wanted to get a win. Oklahoma City finally broke through for the first time in five tries this season. Paul George and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 points, and the Thunder beat the Suns 117-110 on Sunday. “It feels special,” guard Dennis Schroder said. “I think we can build off of that win. We’re going to keep getting better. It was a good one tonight.” Nerlens Noel had 20 points and 15 rebounds and Patrick Patterson added 17 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City’s victory left the Cleveland Cavaliers, who fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday, as the league’s only winless team. Thunder center Steven Adams did not play after experiencing tightness in his left calf during pregame warmups, and Noel started in his place. Coach Billy Donovan was pleased with the way Noel performed in his first start. “He did a lot of really good things,” Donovan said. “He was really, really active. He was very active defensively. He scored some points on some lobs and some rolls and he got to the free-throw line. I was really, really impressed with his defense.” Noel has started 159 of his 228 career games, so he was comfortable in the role. “Just do this on a nightly basis, just being a professional, ready for whatever is thrown at me in this position,” he said. “Steven wasn’t able to go, so I just kept the same mindset of being able to be ready, no matter what. I knew if I was coming off the bench, if I was starting, I’d play the same way. That’s about it.” Rookie Elie Okobo scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton added 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Devin Booker, who entered the day as the league’s ninth-best scorer at 27.8 points per game, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. The Thunder led 62-48 at halftime after shooting 49 percent from the field. George scored 15 points before the break, while Westbrook made just two field goals. The Thunder blew a 14-point halftime lead against Boston on Thursday, so the threat of falling apart still was there. Westbrook hit back-to-back layups to make it 82-65 in the third. George drained a shot from just beyond half court at the third-quarter buzzer to put Oklahoma City up 96-76. “It’s one of the funnest basketball games I’ve played in since I’ve been here,” Noel said. “Guys just play so unselfish. This team is really built the right way. Guys just want to make winning plays, and everybody is going to excel when the play style is like that.” Phoenix outscored the Thunder 34-21 in the fourth quarter. “A lot of positives in the game,” Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. “You’re not going to feel better – we lost the game. But effort was there. I think we tried, and we tried for 48 minutes.”  You can buy a pair of Russell Westbrook‘s Air Jordan “Why Not?” ZER0.1 on the Nike site for $80. Or, you can trade him for a slice of pizza. A young Thunder fan considered it pregame, but wouldn’t give up the slice.

Russell Westbrook on his pizza-shoe trade: pic.twitter.com/Zp6bzhC9xk — Royce Young (@royceyoung) October 29, 2018  As long as it wasn’t a “Hawaiian” pizza with pineapple, I’m good with that trade. The Thunder also picked up their first win of the season, 117-110 against Phoenix. NEW YORK (AP) — Golden State appeared on its way to another easy victory when the game suddenly turned into a 3-point shootout. Luckily for the Warriors, they have the perfect guy for that. Stephen Curry set another NBA record by making seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points as the Warriors held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 120-114 on Sunday. Kevin Durant added 34 for the Warriors, who were coasting before the Nets made it close with some sizzling shooting behind the arc. Curry finally turned them back when his final 3-pointer made it 115-108 with 1:07 to play. He has made at least five 3s in all seven games, breaking George McCloud’s record of six games in a row during the 1995-96 season. “They got hot in the fourth to try to make it interesting, but made enough plays down the stretch to obviously get the win,” Curry said. Klay Thompson continued to struggle behind the arc, going 1 for 5 and falling to 5 for 36 this season. He finished with 18 points and still hasn’t had a 20-point outing this season. D'Angelo Russell scored 25 points and Caris LeVert had 23 for the Nets, who made 20 3-pointers in 42 attempts and cut a 19-point deficit down to two. “I think the 3-pointer got them back in the game and ended up we had to play a little bit and execute down the stretch, so it was a solid outing for us,” Durant said. Golden State has won four in a row since its lone loss and the previous three were all by at least 20 points. The franchise record is four straight 20-point victories, set by the San Francisco Warriors in 1966-67, and it appeared the Warriors were going to equal that. Curry scored 16 points in the first quarter. The Nets hung close until midway through the second, and another 3 by Curry pushed it to 63-44 with 1:55 remaining in the half. “The way the first half went we easily could have kind of folded and that’s not what kind of guys we have in that locker room,” Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. “They’re a resilient bunch and I thought they competed their tails off and it was good for the fans to see that we didn’t just succumb to their talent or their aura so to speak.” Draymond Green had a season-high 13 assists.

It’s not a no-win situation, but no coach is going to pad his stats taking over this roster mid-season. Drew, wisely, wants to be compensated for this. We’ll see if that happens, or if the Cavs go get someone else.

The Thunder also picked up their first win of the season, 117-110 against Phoenix. LOS ANGELES — Every day in the NBA there is a lot to unpack, so every weekday morning throughout the season we will give you the three things you need to know from the last 24 hours in the NBA. 1) The 1-5 Wizards are worse than you think. Watch the Wizards play and what is wrong grows more and more obvious. It’s not the defense — although it’s terrible, the Wizards are allowing 114.5 points per 100 possessions this season (26th in the NBA and 6.9 worse than they gave up last season). It’s not their three-point shooting, although the Wizards are hitting just 31 percent from three as a team. It wasn’t even that the Wizards got blown out by the Clippers 136-104 Sunday night. It’s not the statistics at all. Watch Washington in person and the team’s lack of chemistry is painfully obvious: • When Bradley Beal slipped and went to the floor in the second half, it was Clipper Tobias Harris who helped him up because no Wizard teammate came over to. There were two other similar instances I noticed Sunday night where the Clipper player helped a Wizards player off the floor because teammates did not rush over to do so. • When the Wizards took the court to start the game there was almost no interaction among players — Otto Porter was talking to the referee because that was the only person willing to talk to him. • Clippers players seemed to be more concerned when Markieff Morris went down with an elbow to the face than the Wizards (Morris left the game with a concussion). The Wizards are clearly playing for themselves and not each other, not the team. “That was the first thing Scotty [Brooks, Wizards’ coach] said after the game,” Clippers’ coach Doc Rivers said. “He said, ‘Man, your guys are just, watching them, you just feel the energy and you just feel them. They get along.” Washington’s John Wall and Bradley Beal have spoken before about guys playing for themselves and their stats, not sacrificing for the team, and that theme — on the court and in the locker room — carried over into Sunday. “Just gotta go out there and compete,” John Wall said. “We play like a team that’s 5-1 and people are just going to lay down, we got to play with a sense of urgency that we’re 1-5 now…. “When you play the game of basketball you can’t worry about how many points you got, how many steals you got, how many assists you got, it’s just competing.” Beyond the chemistry, of all the on-court problems, nothing is going to change until the defense improves. “Our defense is horrendous…” Austin Rivers said. “You’ve got to have personal pride. You’ve got to get mad when someone scores on you. We’re not the Warriors.” “Just heart. Just heart and pride,” Wall said of what it will take to fix the defense. “Guard your man one-on-one, that’s really the main key. We gotta do a better job of switching — when we do do that, like we did in the first quarter, I think we played the best we have played for a while.” The switching trend in the NBA is giving the Wizards problems on both ends. “On offense when we get (a switch we like), we take a bad shot sometimes and bail those guys out,” Wall said. “When they put us in bad situations, we gamble too much or don’t stay on the play and get a stop… we do a good job of it in practice, but we have to bring the same competitive edge we have competing against each other in practice to playing someone else.” Washington’s play is ugly and coach Scott Brooks could pay the price with his job if things don’t improve. He certainly is not faultless in all this. However, the Wizards have changed coaches before. They have changed players around on the periphery then spun it as trying to fix chemistry issues (Marcin Gortat going to the Clippers is the latest along those lines). Everything changes except the core, and yet the same problem exists. Which means maybe it’s getting to be time for the Wizards to take a fresh look at that core and if it works. 2) Does firing of Tyronn Lue mean Cavaliers realize it’s time to go all-in on the rebuild? Last July, when LeBron James decided to head west, the Cavaliers brain trust decided to pivot to… nobody is sure what exactly. They wanted to walk the very fine line of a rebuild on the fly — compete now while building for the future — and they fell off that tightrope. This isn’t a team built to win now, not with Kevin Love leading an aging roster constructed to support LeBron — Tristan Thompson, George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver. They are not a group built to create great looks and rack up wins on their own. There’s a reason Vegas set the under/over on wins for the Cavaliers this season at 31.5. It’s also not a rebuild in Cleveland. How many players on the Cavaliers are younger than 25? Four. Just four — Collin Sexton, Ante Zizic, Cedi Osman, and Sam Dekker. Guys we think of as young — Larry Nance Jr., Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood — are all 26 and closer to their prime, and they all come with questions. Sunday Lue paid the price for a 0-6 start and a sense among the front office in Cleveland they needed to go another direction, a coach better suited to a young team (even if the Cavs are not yet htat). That start, however, was not about Lue. It’s about a team in limbo. The Cavaliers need to pick a path. Rebuilding would make the most sense. Play Colin Sexton more and live with the at times painful learning process. He’s got real potential, but he’s still adjusting to the speed of the NBA and settles for far too many long twos. More importantly, it’s time to start working to trade the veterans and getting pieces for a rebuild back (picks and prospects). There will a market at the deadline for Kyle Korver — a shooter on a fair contract, $7.6 million this season and with a $3.4 million buyout for next season. George Hill is overpaid this season ($19 million) but he is a solid point guard when healthy and come the deadline there could be teams willing to take the hit this season knowing he has a $1 million buyout next season. J.R. Smith, at $14.7 million this season (with a $3.9 million buyout next season) will be harder to move because, without LeBron, teams are not sure how much he will help them. Love is the big piece to move, but with his new contract it’s a lot harder. That is probably a next summer move — but it’s one they need to start moving toward. 3) Oklahoma City gets first win of the season. When you’re busting out of a slump, you don’t care where and how it happens. So what if the Phoenix Suns were on the second night of a back-to-back? Who cares if they didn’t have Devin Booker? What matters is Paul George and Russell Westbrook scored 23 points a piece and the Thunder got their first win of the season, 117-110. Westbrook was doing Westbrook things all night. Also, don’t sleep on Nerlens Noel, who had 20 points and 15 boards. OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Thunder didn’t care that Phoenix had just one win this season, was playing the second game of a back-to-back and was missing its leading scorer. They just wanted to get a win. Oklahoma City finally broke through for the first time in five tries this season. Paul George and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 points, and the Thunder beat the Suns 117-110 on Sunday. “It feels special,” guard Dennis Schroder said. “I think we can build off of that win. We’re going to keep getting better. It was a good one tonight.” Nerlens Noel had 20 points and 15 rebounds and Patrick Patterson added 17 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City’s victory left the Cleveland Cavaliers, who fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday, as the league’s only winless team. Thunder center Steven Adams did not play after experiencing tightness in his left calf during pregame warmups, and Noel started in his place. Coach Billy Donovan was pleased with the way Noel performed in his first start. “He did a lot of really good things,” Donovan said. “He was really, really active. He was very active defensively. He scored some points on some lobs and some rolls and he got to the free-throw line. I was really, really impressed with his defense.” Noel has started 159 of his 228 career games, so he was comfortable in the role. “Just do this on a nightly basis, just being a professional, ready for whatever is thrown at me in this position,” he said. “Steven wasn’t able to go, so I just kept the same mindset of being able to be ready, no matter what. I knew if I was coming off the bench, if I was starting, I’d play the same way. That’s about it.” Rookie Elie Okobo scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton added 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Devin Booker, who entered the day as the league’s ninth-best scorer at 27.8 points per game, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. The Thunder led 62-48 at halftime after shooting 49 percent from the field. George scored 15 points before the break, while Westbrook made just two field goals. The Thunder blew a 14-point halftime lead against Boston on Thursday, so the threat of falling apart still was there. Westbrook hit back-to-back layups to make it 82-65 in the third. George drained a shot from just beyond half court at the third-quarter buzzer to put Oklahoma City up 96-76. “It’s one of the funnest basketball games I’ve played in since I’ve been here,” Noel said. “Guys just play so unselfish. This team is really built the right way. Guys just want to make winning plays, and everybody is going to excel when the play style is like that.” Phoenix outscored the Thunder 34-21 in the fourth quarter. “A lot of positives in the game,” Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. “You’re not going to feel better – we lost the game. But effort was there. I think we tried, and we tried for 48 minutes.”  NEW YORK (AP) — Golden State appeared on its way to another easy victory when the game suddenly turned into a 3-point shootout. Luckily for the Warriors, they have the perfect guy for that. Stephen Curry set another NBA record by making seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points as the Warriors held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 120-114 on Sunday. Kevin Durant added 34 for the Warriors, who were coasting before the Nets made it close with some sizzling shooting behind the arc. Curry finally turned them back when his final 3-pointer made it 115-108 with 1:07 to play. He has made at least five 3s in all seven games, breaking George McCloud’s record of six games in a row during the 1995-96 season. “They got hot in the fourth to try to make it interesting, but made enough plays down the stretch to obviously get the win,” Curry said. Klay Thompson continued to struggle behind the arc, going 1 for 5 and falling to 5 for 36 this season. He finished with 18 points and still hasn’t had a 20-point outing this season. D'Angelo Russell scored 25 points and Caris LeVert had 23 for the Nets, who made 20 3-pointers in 42 attempts and cut a 19-point deficit down to two. “I think the 3-pointer got them back in the game and ended up we had to play a little bit and execute down the stretch, so it was a solid outing for us,” Durant said. Golden State has won four in a row since its lone loss and the previous three were all by at least 20 points. The franchise record is four straight 20-point victories, set by the San Francisco Warriors in 1966-67, and it appeared the Warriors were going to equal that. Curry scored 16 points in the first quarter. The Nets hung close until midway through the second, and another 3 by Curry pushed it to 63-44 with 1:55 remaining in the half. “The way the first half went we easily could have kind of folded and that’s not what kind of guys we have in that locker room,” Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. “They’re a resilient bunch and I thought they competed their tails off and it was good for the fans to see that we didn’t just succumb to their talent or their aura so to speak.” Draymond Green had a season-high 13 assists. Tyronn Lue is out in Cleveland, the scapegoat for an organization trying to walk an impossibly-fine line of rebuilding while winning (with a roster that really does neither well). While the Cavaliers were not playing well, when you remove the best player of a generation and the guy who set the culture for the organization, what was there to expect? The Cavaliers want Larry Drew — an assistant on Lue’s staff and former NBA head coach — to take the job on an interim basis. Drew, however, is savvy enough to know better than to just say yes.

Columbia Bureau Chief Catherine Templeton fires a revolver in her latest campaign ad for South Carolina governor. COLUMBIA — Catherine Templeton fires away in her new ad for South Carolina governor. The new statewide TV spot features the Republican Mount Pleasant attorney shooting the .38-caliber revolver she said her grandfather gave her to shoot snakes around her family's Oconee County fishing trailer while talking about fixing corruption and wasteful spending in state government. The ad includes a shot of a rattlesnake. Templeton aims the gun toward the ground and fires two shots. “We can’t shoot the snakes slithering around Columbia," she says, "but we will end their poisonous big government ways.” Her campaign said she did not really shoot at a snake. Templeton's new ad was a misfire for some. The Democratic Governors Association's chief spokesman tweeted, "This comes very close to threatening to shoot politicians." Gun ownership remains a powerful issue in South Carolina, even after the deadly Charleston church mass shooting in 2015 and the Townville elementary school shooting in 2016 that killed a first-grader. Major gun control efforts in the Statehouse failed after those tragedies. Many in the state say gun ownership is part of their heritage built on hunting and self-reliance. Nearly six in 10 South Carolinians live in a home with a gun, according to a Winthrop University poll last month. Still, 85 percent of Palmetto State gun owners favor requiring a background check for firearm purchases, even if it takes longer than three days as mandated by law, the poll found. Templeton's new ad aims to build her resume with GOP voters in her first run for elected office. Templeton, who led state's public health and labor departments before working at two other state agencies, is running on a platform to reform state government — a message similar to the one Donald Trump used to win the White House. Email Sign Up! She has kept pace in campaign fundraising with Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who had been in public service and politics since being appointed U.S. attorney for South Carolina in 1981. Trump has endorsed McMaster. Templeton often references her previous relationship with former Gov. Nikki Haley, who fired off a machine gun at a Columbia firearms plant a year before her re-election bid in 2013. This is not the first commercial featuring Templeton with a gun. A pro-Templeton spot produced by the American Future Fund, a politically active nonprofit, opens with her in hunting gear holding a shotgun.

Over the past few years, I’ve gotten into the odd (and I suppose rather Jewish) habit of reading the entire cycle of the Federalist Papers each year, as close as I can manage to the anniversary of each paper’s publication. It’s easy to do. Most of the essays are about the length of a newspaper column, so it doesn’t take long to read them. I usually do it on the train on the way to the office, and it still leaves me plenty of time to read the news and get depressed.

That's what Donald Trump had to say after learning of a shooting that occurred at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday. He thinks that good guys with guns — whether in the congregation or via hired security — could have stopped this bad guy with a gun. Instead of making the easy choice to condemn the violent actions that led to multiple deaths, the President of the United States paraphrased an NRA talking point. Trump says Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh has “little to do with” gun laws, says the synagogue should have “had some kind of a protection” inside the temple, and later blames synagogue for not having armed guards. pic.twitter.com/AWg5AwkEKp — Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) October 27, 2018 Trump made a different kind of easy choice here. He doesn't care about this country. He doesn't care about his "base," the voters who still support him despite his active efforts to make many of their lives worse. He only cares about himself. And there's money to be made in keeping the NRA happy. SEE ALSO: Twitter shames Trump for doing the absolute least in the wake of explosive devices So he shifted the blame. It's not the gunman who strode into a synagogue during Saturday morning Shabbat services who's at fault. It's the synagogue for not hardening itself against such threats. His critics on Twitter saw right through it of course, just like they always do. The outraged response Trump drew won't change his behavior in the slightest, but here's yet another receipt, another example of wounded voters struggling to comprehend the evil actions of their president, added to the pile. Donald Trump just said the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has little to do with gun laws and if they’d had “protection,” they may have survived.

Maybe you wanna tell everyone you’re a Nationalist again. Or perhaps you wanna talk about all the fine folks on the side of the Nazis? Maybe you & your @NRA friends can talk about arming rabbis, or bar/bat mitzvah kids? https://t.co/xrck529myu — tara strong (@tarastrong) October 27, 2018 No need to worry people Trump has the answer.

Moss (@BradMossEsq) October 27, 2018 Trump says that the synagogue should have had “protection.” There was reportedly a bris going on. A baby was being circumcised.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pittsburgh-congregation-leaders-20181028-story.html---split---A year and a half ago, before becoming the target of the deadliest attack on Jewish people in U.S. history, the Dor Hadash congregation in Pittsburgh’s historic Squirrel Hill neighborhood came together and made a well-meaning decision. The lay-led Reconstructionist Judaism congregation of about 150 families, whose progressive-leaning members take turns leading services at their synagogue, determined that one of its priorities would be to support immigration and refugee issues. So the congregation partnered with HIAS, a Jewish-founded nonprofit that helps resettle refugees from around the world. Dor Hadash “stands for diversity, inclusion … for LGBT rights, we have leaders from the LGBT community, we have mixed marriages, we have people of color in the congregation … you get the picture,” Carolyn Ban, a 75-year-old retired professor who chairs the congregation’s social-justice committee, said in a phone interview Sunday. “This is a very socially engaged congregation.” Ban, who led the congregation’s Shabbat for refugees in partnership with HIAS this month, was at her Squirrel Hill home Saturday morning, shortly before Dor Hadash’s services were set to begin, when she got an email from a Muslim friend in one of her interfaith discussion groups. “What’s happening at Dor Hadash?” her friend wrote. “There is an active shooter alert in the neighborhood.” A gunman armed with an AR-15 and three handguns, who had shared neo-Nazi posts on social media, had burst into their synagogue, which is also shared by two conservative Jewish congregations, and opened fired as the groups’ services were getting underway, killing 11 people. It does not seem to have been a random attack. On Oct. 10, the shooting suspect, Robert Bowers, of Pittsburgh, had posted a list of HIAS’ partners on social media, which included Dor Hadash. Then, in the moments before the shooting, Bowers posted again, writing that “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people” — suggesting that the Dor Hadash congregation may have been his specific alleged target due to its refugee advocacy work. One of the Dor Hadash members, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, who was helping set up for the morning’s services, was killed, and another member, Dan Leger, was wounded, Ban said. Both men had dedicated their lives to helping others. Rabinowitz was a primary-care physician and Leger is a hospital chaplain, Ban said. Leger had been in charge of the congregation’s “loving kindness” committee and was often responsible for weddings, funerals and helping hospitalized members. “Now we’ll be helping him,” Ban said. Ban’s voice began to catch and grow unsteady as she discussed the gunman at the synagogue — and his possible motive of attacking Dor Hadash for its support for immigrants and refugees. “I’m very proud of the work we do … we have no second thoughts about that,” Ban said. “Many of us, frankly, feel great pity for this man, because he must have been in terrible pain to do such a thing.” Ban’s voice broke, and on the phone, she fell silent for a few seconds. “Really, that’s the conversations I’ve been having today with people.” She thought President Trump’s suggestion that an armed guard could have prevented the massacre was wrong. She pointed out that the gunman came in with an AR-15. He wounded four police officers before he was captured. “An armed guard would have been able to do nothing,” Ban said. “The other thing is, this does not change my strong opposition to the death penalty, which would accomplish nothing and be counter to our values.” The other priority that Dor Hadash had singled out for its advocacy a year and a half ago was criminal justice reform. But it’s too early to say what the congregation’s official collective, long-term response to the shooting will be, Ban said. A local church has donated space for the congregation to meet. “We welcome anybody to join our congregation who shares a commitment to social justice and social action and who wants to be part of a caring, loving community,” Ban said. Dor Hadash may have come under attack, but its doors remain very much open.
---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-bowers-synagogue-shooter-hate-crime_us_5bd4892be4b0a8f17ef84019---split---The man accused of committing a deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday was an avowed anti-Semite who police say announced his presence by shouting “All Jews must die!” before he opened fire. Robert Bowers allegedly shot and killed at least 10 people and wounded others at the Tree of Life Congregation, which was full of people at the time. Police said he entered the building, made the anti-Semitic declaration, opened fire, and then barricaded himself inside before he was taken into custody. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice plans to file federal hate crime charges against Bowers, as well as “other criminal charges.” “The Department of Justice will continue to support our state and local partners and we will continue to bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people,” Sessions said in a Saturday afternoon statement. While a motive hasn’t been made official, it’s clear from Bowers’ online persona that he was a racist who held a deep hatred for Jewish people. He was active on Gab, a social media platform popular among neo-Nazis, and regularly posted racist and anti-Jewish sentiments. His biography on the site said: “jews are the children of satan.” Less than two hours before the shooting, he railed against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in increasingly desperate posts, saying that he’d had enough of the “hostile invaders” and was “going in.” “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he wrote. His profile was taken down shortly after 11:30 a.m. But archives of his activity on the platform showed that he was an anti-Semite who was critical of President Trump for not being a true “nationalist,” and openly discussed the QAnon conspiracy theory, a dangerous, all-encompassing conspiracy web that started online and has since wormed its way into real life. He regularly reposted neo-Nazi content and openly lambasted diversity. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation,” he wrote on Thursday. “#Qanon is here to get patriots that were against martial law in the 90′s to be the ones begging for it now to drain muh swamp.” He had also commented on the capture of Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested in Florida on Friday after allegedly sending more than a dozen explosive devices to various high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros. He poked fun at Sayoc’s garish van, which was covered in pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers, as well as conspiracy theories and memes. Gab released a statement after the shooting, saying that the site doesn’t allow for calls to violence: “Gab.com’s policy on terrorism and violence have always been very clear: we a have zero tolerance policy for it. Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. This has always been our policy. We are saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh and are keeping the families and friends of all victims in our thoughts and prayers.” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said authorities were still trying to learn the “extent of this anti-Semitic attack.” “We are devastated,” he wrote on Twitter. “Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community.” This story has been updated with a statement from Jeff Sessions.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gab-white-nationalists-20181028-story.html#nt=related-content---split---It’s Organizing 101: For any social movement to expand and succeed, like-minded supporters need to connect with one another — through meetings, rallies or social media. But white nationalism isn’t just any social movement. Meetings get canceled when venue owners realize who’s renting their space. Rallies come under violent attack by organized anti-fascists. And big Silicon Valley tech companies are coming under increasing pressure to kick far-right personalities off their services. Saturday’s mass shooting by a neo-Nazi sympathizer at a Pittsburgh synagogue — which left 11 dead and is thought to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history — is likely to redouble the tough scrutiny on how the organized white nationalist movement spreads its message inside the U.S. Much of that scrutiny is already falling on Gab, a social-media service that has served as a safe harbor for white nationalists at a time when the movement has faltered under intense internal and public pressure. The suspect in the Pittsburgh shooting, Robert Bowers, was an active user. The white nationalist movement’s most recent troubles had stemmed in large part from its rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, where officials say one far-right demonstrator drove his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters, killing one. After Charlottesville, social-media companies, payment processors and service providers, bowing to public outrage, began to crack down on far-right users and start-ups who were using such mainstream services to post online, host websites and accept donations from fans. White nationalists also pointed fingers internally over who was most responsible for the event’s chaos and the negative “optics” of the rally. The movement has been further sapped by members’ arrests, fundraising problems and embarrassing media coverage of the domestic problems of key figures, including Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute and Matthew Heimbach of the Traditionalist Worker Party. “The leadership of the organized movement is in pretty bad straits,” said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that monitors and sometimes sues far-right groups. But one bright spot has been Gab, a Twitter-like social-media service whose logo is a green frog, which has attracted far-right users for its unwillingness to eject racist users. Bowers’ account featured neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic memes on his page, and he posted on the site about his plans moments before attacking the synagogue. Bowers was a “verified” user on Gab, which indicates he was likely a “premium” account holder who paid to gain access to special features on the site, which claims more than 700,000 users. Gab quickly removed Bowers’ profile Saturday but has declined to eject other white nationalist posters — a no-censorship stance that very much seems part of the start-up’s plan from its founding in 2016 to build an anti-establishment right-wing customer base as a pathway to profitability. “We welcome everyone, but see a unique opportunity to carve a niche in a massively underserved and unrepresented market,” the company said in a June 21 prospectus filed with the Security and Exchange Commission as part of a securities offering. “We estimate that there are over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users from around the world who are seeking an alternative to the current social networking ecosystems.” Gab’s operators, led by Pennsylvania-based founder Andrew Torba, who owns a majority share in the company, have bristled when mainstream news outlets, including the Los Angeles Times, have focused almost exclusively on the company’s troublemaking far-right customers at the expense of less radical Gab users. (Gab didn’t respond to a request for comment.) But the far-right users are the ones who make the company so newsworthy. Due to its willingness to accept white nationalists, “Gab, in some ways, is the largest hate site on the web,” Beirich said. One of America’s most prominent neo-Nazis, Andrew Anglin, who has been banned from multiple platforms — but not from Gab — has a similar assessment. “I am very thankful to Torba for letting me use the site when Jews attempted to literally ban me from the internet,” Anglin wrote Sunday on his neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer, which has also been kicked off multiple service providers. (Anglin has effectively been in hiding as the Southern Poverty Law Center tries to sue him for directing his readers to harass a Jewish woman in Montana.) Now, after the Pittsburgh shooting, Gab is growing similarly isolated as the payment processors Stripe and PayPal and the hosting service Joyent cut off services to the social-media company. On Sunday, the company’s Turkish chief technology officer, Ekrem Buyukkaya, announced that he was resigning from the company, citing the pressure of working for such a controversial employer. “The attacks from the American press have been relentless for two years now and have taken a toll on me personally,” Buyukkaya wrote in a post Sunday. “I wish Gab nothing but the best and will do everything I can to help them transition to a new CTO.” Like any start-up, the troubles could pose problems for the young company’s viability if they put a dent in its budget or slow its growth. In 2017, Gab reported a net loss of more than $200,000 and a cash balance of $637,291. That same year, the company briefly sued Google for anti-competitive practices for not allowing Gab to be downloaded on the Google Play store. (Gab soon dropped the lawsuit.) In March, Gab reported that an independent audit had expressed “substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” though it expressed hopes more recently that those doubts had been alleviated. The company has reported collecting $1 million in crowdfunded sales of securities in 2017 and said it had hopes to collect another $5 million in another round of sales in 2018. “If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned development and operations, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results,” the company reported in September. Gab has been vowing, in posts on Twitter, to move forward as it battles to stay online — and to stay alive. “New hosting provider secured. Working around the clock to see to it that Gab.com stays online,” Torba posted on Gab on Sunday. “You can’t stop the power of The People in their fight for freedom and liberty against tyranny. FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.”

Eric S.C. Manning told his congregants during an emotional sermon on Sunday. “The words that come out of your mouth can do much harm or much good. The choice is indeed yours.” Manning criticized Trump for claiming “armed guards” likely could have prevented a gunman’s attack on the Tree of Life Congregation, which left at least 11 people dead and several others wounded. He contrasted Trump’s remarks to former President Barack Obama’s response to the 2015 mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church (commonly referred to as Mother Emanuel). “We were comforted by President Barack Obama, who came and sang ‘Amazing Grace,’” Manning said. “He began to use the eloquence of his speech to provide comfort at a time in which we all needed much comfort.” But Manning said he was baffled Saturday as he watched Trump respond to the shooting in Pittsburgh, one of the worst anti-Semitic attacks in U.S. history. “I was becoming more outraged and outraged,” Manning said, “because as opposed to saying, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and violence has no place in the United States, and hateful speech will no longer be tolerated,’ there was a meltdown on his part, saying maybe just maybe if they were armed we wouldn’t have had this problem. Words do matter.” Manning called on Trump to use his words to heal people ― and also encouraged members of his church to get out and vote if they want to see change. “The tongue has the power of life and death,” Manning said. “Sometimes we don’t think that other people are paying attention, but they are indeed paying attention. They hear exactly what you’re saying and sometimes people unfortunately utter certain thoughtless phrases that instead of lifting up a certain people, they begin to rally around a dog whistle.” Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was in office during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, also said a few words during Sunday’s service at Mother Emanuel. “I suppose that Mother Emanuel might be feeling a special weight this morning after the tragedy and the violence in Pittsburgh yesterday, and how it must bring back the tragedy and violence in this community and in this sacred place,” Patrick said. He continued: “There’s been so much poison, so much poison, so much hate ... but I also know what you know ― that we don’t have to sow just hate, that we can also sow grace. ... I know that we can sow better seeds in our politics.”

The alleged gunman has been identified by authorities as 46-year-old Robert Bowers. He allegedly opened fire at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh after screaming, "All Jews must die," KDKA reported, citing police. "It's a very horrific crime scene," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell D. Hissrich said at a press conference. "It's one of the worst I've seen." At least six others were injured, four of whom were police officers who raced to the scene, according to authorities. The officers’ injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, according to reports, but the other two victims were listed in critical and serious condition. No children were injured, Hissrich said. Police were called to the scene by several people inside of the building just before 10 a.m. The suspect and police exchanged gunfire before he surrendered, authorities said. The gunman was taken to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds and is in fair condition, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Authorities said the shooting is being investigated as a federal hate crime. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group believes it is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history. ‘‘Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh,’’ Greenblatt told the Associated Press. President Trump condemned the attacks during a speech at an event in Indiana Saturday. "This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable, our nation and the world are shocked," Trump said. He added that "vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism" needs to be rejected. Governor Tom Wolf also issued a statement after the tragedy. “The shooting in Pittsburgh this morning is an absolute tragedy," Wolf said. “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need." A Gofundme page has been established for the victims.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.insideedition.com/moms-gut-feeling-helps-thwart-what-could-have-been-mass-school-shooting-47883---split---A mother went with her "gut feeling" and thwarted a possible school shooting after a man sent her a racist message on Facebook, according to reports. Koeberle Bull, of New Jersey, told Yahoo News she received a message from a man in Kentucky, calling her biracial children “the N-word,” among other things. Bull said she was concerned because the man’s profile showed a gun and so she called her local police station and filed a report. She then reportedly took a screenshot of the message and posted it to Facebook. "Something told me not to let this go," Bull told CBS News. Police in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, got wind of the message and Bull spoke with officers there who took the tip seriously. On Thursday, officers drove to the man’s house, identified as Dylan Jarrell, and say they found the 20-year-old with 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a gun and a high-capacity magazine. Police also said Jarrell had a detailed plan of attack aimed at two schools in nearby counties. “There’s no doubt in my mind that as a result of this investigation, we saved lives,” Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said during a press conference. “This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc." Police said they also reportedly found searches on his computers, such as “how to conduct a school shooting.” Jarrell had also been previously questioned by the FBI about threats he made toward a Tennessee school on social media, according to reports. He’s been charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications. His public defender, Amy Robertson, asked that people not jump to conclusions about the case. "These cases are very complex and often have many sides to them. It is not uncommon for it to take a long time for all the facts to come out," Robertson said. Jarrell has pleaded not guilty.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.pineappleandcoconut.com/recipes/bride-frankenstein-cocktail-blackberry-champagne-cocktail/#more-1914---split---Out of all the Halloween moves there are, the Frankenstein ones are my favorite. From, The 1930’s orginial Frankenstein movies to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to the oh so cheesy but awesome Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks. One of my favorites is The Bride of Frankenstein. Her hair alone is just so fantastic. So for my last Halloween cocktail for Cost Plus World Market this week I knew I wanted to create a cocktail in honor of her, plus World Market had some awesome Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein Halloween products in the store that I needed to own. I just love the color of this vanilla blackberry champagne cocktail. So very Halloween.  I LOVE that World Market has these trays with photos of the original Frankenstein’s Monster and Bride of Frankenstein from the 1930s. Those were the best films. I highly suggest watching them if you haven’t. They really don’t make movies like they used to. I love old black and white films from the 30s and 40s. So fun, so cheesy but so great because they didn’t have all the computers that they have today for special effects, editing etc. It was all props and editing reels of film by hand which is such tedious and time consuming work, and yet, the movies are timeless and incredible.   The Frankenstein movie I have seen way more than any other is Young Frankenstein. And if you are a classic movie buff like I am you will love how much it parodied from the early 30’s Frankenstein films. I blame my mom for making me a fan of Mel Brooks movies. They are so corny and cheesy and full of puns. But I love them and I have to say Young Frankenstein is my favorite movie of his and, sadly, I quote it more often than I should. Way more often. And if I find it on TV to watch I will always stop and watch it. I would say its a top 5 favorite movie of mine. My mom and I always quote the “yummy sounds” scene. Or we will be at a family dinner and say “mmmmmm” while eating and joke about making a yummy sound. In that scene they are eating a dessert that I have made before but never blogged so I think I will need to do that one of these days. (Which I finally did. Two years later. Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte)  I have been having way too much photographing these cocktails all week. I decided for these ones to get some dry ice for a spooky effect and for a much less smoky house. The fog machine was awesome but it really fogged up the house and was pouring out the windows I was amazed none of my neighbors called 911 thinking my house was on fire. So I decided I am leaving that for outside use on Halloween, and dry ice it was for these cocktails. My husband picked up some dry ice from local grocery store the other day for me and as I was shooting pics I realized it wasn’t enough and it fizzled out before I had a chance to take pics of the drinks with some of the ice in them. Booooo. I got a much bigger block of the dry ice to retake the photos the next day and after I was done shooting I realized I hadn’t mixed the drinks the exact same and the color was slightly different, plus there was a 4 hour difference in time of shooting the pics. The other day was at 4pm and the next day was 10 am. I get pretty much consistent light through the window of the room I use for my photos but that clearly made a big enough difference. The first photo in this post is from the first day the rest are from the second day. The drink is fantastic and I preferred the look of the darker color, but even with a little less jam in the cocktail it is so tasty. I measured the jam the first time and eyeballed it the second. I guess my eyeballs are a little off. Either way you measure or eyeball, these vanilla blackberry champagne cocktails are sure to be a hit on Halloween. Or any day you feel like having one. Brunch perhaps?  I think from now on all my posts need to have dry ice in them. I love the effect. Although it might be weird for Valentine’s day or summertime recipes like for popsicles. OH wait that would be cool like the popsicles were extra frosty cold. Hmmm.  Bride Of Frankenstein Cocktail (Vanilla Blackberry Champagne Cocktail) Makes two cocktails by Shanna  Pretty sure that Frankenstein’s Monster and his Bride would have loved to drink these.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.thedailybeast.com/hateand-hitlerin-the-heartland-the-arrest-of-frazier-glenn-miller---split---The man accused of shooting three at Jewish centers in Kansas was a well-known neo-Nazi and KKK grand wizard who once created a points system for murder. The sole suspect in a shooting that left three dead at two Jewish community centers outside Kansas City on Sunday is a former Ku Klux Klan “grand dragon,” neo-Nazi, and ex-con named Frazier Glenn Miller. The 73-year-old was caught by TV cameras yelling “Heil Hitler” from the back seat of a police car after he was apprehended in the parking lot of a local elementary school. Rabbi Herbert Mandl, chaplain for the Overland Park Police Department, said the gunman asked people whether they were Jewish before he opened fire. Two of the victims, named by grieving family members as Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, 14, were not Jewish, however--they were members of the nearby United Methodist Church of the Resurrection. The Southern Poverty Law Center said they had confimed Miller’s arrest with his wife, Marge, who said her husband had been drinking at a Missouri casino the night before and had not been heard from since. Marge Miller told the SPLC that authorities came to her door at 8:30 p.m. on Sunday and told her that her husband had been arrested in the shootings. Miller, who also uses the alias Frazier Glenn Cross Jr., has an extensive résumé of hate. A former Green Beret who served in Vietnam, he embraced white supremacy in the 1970s, first joining the National States’ Rights Party and then the National Socialist Party of America—the Nazis. According to his considerable dossier on the SPLC website Miller was forced to retire from the military due to his extremist connections. He bought a farm in Angier, North Carolina, where he formed the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980. He preferred wearing fatigues to the traditional Klan robe and recruited active-duty soldiers to conduct paramilitary-style training, aggressively seeking publicity and taking inspiration from Hitler, as he described in his autobiography: “I would try to emulate Hitler’s methods of attracting members and supporters…I placed great emphasis on staging marches and rallies. It had been successful with Hitler.” His stated goal was to create an all-white “Carolina Free State.” Miller’s dark ambitions with the Carolina Knights hit a legal obstacle when the Southern Poverty Law Center successfully sued him and his organization and received a consent decree requiring that they stop all intimidation against African-Americans and paramilitary activity. In 1985, Miller formed the White Patriot Party, ostensibly trying to move into the political sphere, but he was convicted of criminal contempt a year later for purchasing weapons and explosives to fund an insurgency to create a “White Southland.” He was sentenced to a year in prison but went underground while out on bond. He mailed supporters—whom he called “Aryan warriors of The Order”—establishing a point system for each murder: “Niggers (1), White race traitors (10), Jews (10), Judges (50) Morris Seligman Dees (888).” Dees is the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. After the FBI tear-gassed Miller and four Klansman out of a mobile home loaded with weapons and explosives in Springfield, Missouri, Miller served three years in federal penitentiary, reducing his sentence in a plea deal by testifying against 14 other white supremacists. In recent years, Miller ran unsuccessfully for elective offices, including the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S Senate, receiving 23 and seven votes, respectively. His 2010 Senate campaign—for which his slogan was “It’s the Jews, Stupid”—landed him an interview on The Howard Stern Show. In response to Stern’s quip that Miller was the most “honest politician” in America because he made his beliefs crystal clear, Miller replied that U.S. politicians “are all a bunch of whores for Israel, they’re all corrupt to the core, and they’re all traitors to America.” Miller prominently displays a link to the interview on his low-budget website, Whty.org, dedicated to white supremacy and anti-Semitism, including photos of Klan rallies and extensive screeds about the Jewish control of the media. Miller has long been a regular contributor on anti-Semitic and white supremacist Internet forum Vanguard News Network (VNN). He even took to VNN before an interview with Sacha Baron Cohen’s fictional character “Bruno”—which he later claimed he knew was a setup—boasting on a message board that he was being paid by a German TV station to “air my racist and anti-semitic ‘ravings’ far and wide.” In 2012, Miller lectured a class at Missouri State University at the request of a professor whose class wanted to know more about white supremacists, BuzzFeed reports. “They came out of there convinced that white supremacy is a real thing and a dangerous thing,” Professor David Embree said. The SPLC notes that such sites appear to be breeding grounds for violence. Kevin William Harpham posted on VNN before he planted an improvised explosive device along the route of the 2011 Martin Luther King Day parade in Spokane, Washington. “Our research shows that racist killers are hiding among us in plain sight,” the SPLC wrote in its report on Miller. “A forthcoming two-year study by the SPLC will show that nearly 100 people in the last five years have been murdered by active users on another prominent racist website, Stormfront.org.” On a hate and booze bender, as hundreds of teenagers were expected to arrive for a talent competition and actors were rehearsing for a production of To Kill a Mockingbird the day before Passover, Miller apparently fulfilled his decades of threats and allegedly fired shots outside the Overland Park Jewish Community Center. Dr. Corporen was taking his grandson, an Eagle Scout and freshman at Blue Valley High School, for singing try-outs when they were struck down. "We take comfort knowing they are together in Heaven," the family said in a statement. Dr. Corporen, who was approaching his 50th wedding anniversary, was described as a “well-loved physician” in the local community. The shooter then moved on to the Village Shalom retirement community, where a woman was killed on the scene. Overland Police Chief John Douglass declined to release Miller’s name at a press conference Sunday, instead describing the suspect simply as a white male in his 70s who has a beard and is not from Kansas. Douglass did tell reporters that police were certain a shotgun was used in the attacks and were investigating the possibility that a handgun and an assault rifle may have been used as well. Douglass confirmed at the press conference that the FBI already had agents on the ground investigating the shootings as a hate crime. President Obama released a statement on Sunday night, offering his thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims. “While we do not know all of the details surrounding today’s shooting, the initial reports are heartbreaking,” he said. Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said Miller has posted to Stormfront.org.
---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/security-experts-say-houses-worship-vulnerable-attacks-n925276?icid=related---split---After a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday, President Donald Trump suggested armed guards belong at houses of worship — a safety measure the Jewish community has deployed for at least two decades, security experts said. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better,” Trump said after the shooting that left 11 dead and six injured, two critically. Many security experts consider houses of worship “soft targets” — places that are especially vulnerable to potential attacks, and Jewish institutions often view beefed-up security as a necessity in a world that presents constant threats. Deadly shootings across denominations in recent years include 26 killed at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017; nine at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; six at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 2012; and three at a Jewish Community Center in Overland Park, Kansas, in 2014. Last year, a firearms training school in Corona, California, added a "synagogue security" class to its list of courses. Previous private training sessions for synagogues were popular enough to offer a full course, said William Murphy, co-owner of Firearms Training Associates. The synagogue security class includes how to use a handgun to stop an attacker, he said. "We believe in an armed response," Murphy said. "There's no way to stop a crazy guy with a gun if there isn’t a gun on site." Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at the synagogue who retired more than a year ago, said off-duty police are hired to work security during the high holidays in the fall, but otherwise there are no guards, and the entrance is open during sabbath. "It's a nice community," he said. Jewish institutions have long been targets for domestic terrorists and often deploy armed security, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, social action director at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. It’s a policy that gained new urgency after the 1999 shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles that wounded five, including three young children. Many Jewish institutions beefed up security, and the Los Angeles Police Department increased patrols of houses of worship. "The wake-up call back then definitely had an impact on Jewish institutions," Cooper said. But, he added, there probably will always be softer targets. In 1999, white supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr. drove from Tacoma, Washington, to Los Angeles in search of victims but bypassed the Simon Wiesenthal Center because tight security there “sent him looking for an easier target,” according to an account posted online by the center. Cooper said high-profile security at two other Jewish institutions in Los Angeles prevented Furrow, now serving life at a federal penitentiary, from attacking them. That’s the point of good security, but it also means a determined attacker will eventually find victims, Cooper said. "You have serious security on your perimeter, chances are, as with Buford Furrow, the individual might look somewhere else," he said. Safdar Khwaja, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, said his organization advised all area mosques to increase security after the synagogue shooting. In the past few years, Khwaja said, “a lot” of mosques have reached out to ask for guidance on how to keep their attendees safe, with many asking if they should have an armed guard. “It’s a very sad state of affairs,” Khwaja said. “Some feel that they’re secure, but they may not be.” Elizabeth Chuck is a reporter for NBC News.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-know-alleged-mass-shooter-robert-225504414--abc-news-topstories.html---split---Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: What we know about alleged mass shooter Robert Bowers originally appeared on abcnews.go.com The man who allegedly opened fire on worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue in what is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history acted alone, authorities said. Eleven people were killed and six more were injured, including four police officers, when authorities say the suspect opened fire at the Tree of Life*Or L’Simcha congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. An assault rifle and three handguns were found on the suspect, Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, said during a press conference Saturday afternoon. (MORE: Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting claims 11 lives; 4 officers among multiple wounded, officials say) The suspect has been identified Robert Bowers, who is 46 years old. Bowers has several firearms and hunting licenses registered in his name and has addresses in the Pittsburgh area. "This is the most horrific crime scene I've ever seen," Jones said. Twenty-nine federal charges were filed against Bowers late Saturday, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. "On Saturday, October 27, 2018, at 8:05 p.m., U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell signed a criminal complaint charging Robert Bowers of Baldwin, Pa., with 29 counts setting forth federal crimes of violence and firearms offenses," the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania said in a statement. "The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes. The FBI in Pittsburgh is leading the investigation." The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. "The suspect's full motive is unknown but we believe he was acting alone," Jones added. By Saturday evening, residents of the Pittsburgh apartment building where Bowers appeared to be living most recently -- who had been evacuated earlier in the day -- were allowed back into their apartments. Neighbors who live in the complex described the suspect to ABC News as a quiet loner who lived alone and didn't stick out as any sort of danger. “The most terrifying thing is how normal he seemed,” remarked neighbor Chris Hall. Hall said he wished there had been "some type of warning sign." “I wish there was something tattooed on him or something that said ‘hey, this is what’s going on in my head.’” The Anti-Defamation League condemned the attack in a statement, saying it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," the ADL said in a statement. (MORE: After Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Trump champions armed guards, death penalty) The suspect is in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds at a local hospital after being taken into custody, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters during the press conference Saturday afternoon. At 9:54 a.m. Saturday, police received reports of an active shooter at Tree of Life, where a service was taking place, Hissrich said. The congregants were attending a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue, Pennsylvania's state attorney general told the Associated Press. There was also a morning Shabbat service scheduled from 9:45 a.m. to noon, according to the synagogue's website. After entering the church, Bowers allegedly killed at least 11 people, Jones said, and exchanged fire with officers, some of whom were injured. Bowers was also shot. He was taken into custody and brought to the hospital, Hissrich said. Law enforcement is looking closely at a social media account believed to be linked to the suspect. A counterterrorism official briefed on the probe says they are looking at Bowers' social media profiles, looking at what he allegedly posted and his conversations. Since the incident happened at a synagogue, it is being treated as a federal hate crime and will be handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the assistance of local, county and state police, he added. Upon arriving in Indiana for a speech before the Future Farmers of America, President Donald Trump called the attack an "anti-Semitic crime." "This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil, hard to believe, and frankly something that is unimaginable," Trump said at the start of the event. "Our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief. This was an anti-Semitic act. You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we don't seem to learn from the past." "The vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism must be condemned anywhere and everywhere it appears," he added. Speaking to reporters before boarding his flight to Indiana earlier in the day, Trump called the suspected shooter "a wacko" and a "maniac." He also said the suspect should "pay the ultimate price" and be subjected to the death penalty.
---split---3.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-report-20181026-story.html#nt=related-content---split---Before Friday’s offensive explosion against the Rockets, the Clippers had struggled to keep up amid the NBA's scoring increase. They entered the matchup with Houston ranked 24th in points per 100 possessions and 25th in effective field-goal percentage. While all teams combined to average 113.4 points a game during the season’s first eight days, the Clippers were 5.9 points behind. “We’ve got to play at a better pace,” coach Doc Rivers said before his team had a season-high 70 points in the first half of a 133-113 win. “We’ve got to play downhill better and we’ve got to work the sets better. I think it’s very fixable but we’ve got to do it. It just seems like in practice we do a great job at it, we get in the game the spacing goes away, guys forget the next option, they get more aggressive with the ball. “So it just takes time. That will happen. And then let’s be honest, we’ve got to make open shots because we’ve got a lot of open shots that we haven’t made.” The Clippers rank among the top half in drives per game and near the league average in shooting percentage. A bigger culprit has been their three-point shooting, which was 29.3% entering Friday. “I thought we were a better three-point shooting team coming into it, and so far we haven’t been,” Rivers said.  Hours later the Clippers answered, making 12 of 23 threes. Forward Luc Mbah a Moute wasn’t concerned about the slow start. Rivers has complained his team isn’t trusting its sets, but Mbah a Moute said that will come once everyone in the rotation knows them and teammates’ tendencies. “We still have to know each other, play with each other and know where each other’s shots are going to come from and learn the offense,” he said. “I think once we do that then we get better because it’s like now, sometimes, ‘Oh, OK, I didn’t know he was going to pass, I got the shot,’ so you don’t really know where your passes are going to come from.” Clippers connection Mike D’Antoni knew the Clippers’ personnel well, having coached Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell and Mbah a Moute during three seasons coaching the Rockets. His connections to the team actually go back much further. While playing in Milan in 1988, D’Antoni invited Americans he knew from basketball circles to celebrate Thanksgiving at his house. One of those attendees was Bob Hill, an American coaching Milan’s rival, Virtus Bologna, who brought along his toddler son, Casey. Hill’s son is now in his first season as a Clippers assistant, having been promoted from the team’s G League franchise. “His dad was a great coach,” D’Antoni said, “and that was fun.” D’Antoni also roomed with the father of Clippers forward Danilo Gallinari, Vittorio, while playing in Milan in the ’80s. Two decades later, as coach of the New York Knicks, D’Antoni got Gallinari in the 2008 draft’s first round. “Couldn’t shoot a lick,” D’Antoni said of Gallinari’s father. “My first year over there, he was my running buddy. Just a winner. All on the defensive end, played relentlessly. Definitely a farm boy, but a cultured farm boy from Italy.” Teodosic gets on the court After struggling to find a foothold in the rotation, point guard Milos Teodosic made his season debut Friday, checking in with three minutes remaining in the first quarter. He had eight points, seven rebounds and five assists in 17 minutes. “He was great,” Rivers said. “Give him credit, Milos put in the time, he hasn’t been playing, he’s been playing one-on-ones every day, three-on-threes every day, his conditioning looked pretty good. He was phenomenal.” Left unclear was whether the performance was enough to earn him more minutes. The 31-year-old Serbian averaged 25.2 minutes in 45 games last season, his first in the NBA, and shot nearly 38% from three-point range while taking five a game. He injured a hamstring in training camp and missed three preseason games, and in his absence rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander emerged in the backcourt. “I always say, ‘Well, who should we sit?’” Rivers said earlier Friday when asked if Teodosic lost his place in the rotation. “Because he has a lot of good guys in front of him. “I think he’s such a great ball mover for our team and he’s really the only pure point guard. I guess Shai is a pure point guard, as well, but those two are the only two we have on our team and at times we’ll need that.”

President Trump and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi are featured in tens of thousands of political ads this year, suggesting Republicans and Democrats are trying to galvanize their bases ahead of the midterms. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting on Saturday and the arrest days earlier in the case of pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats are forcing both parties to adapt in the final full week of campaigning before midterm elections. 362 President Trump denounced the mass shooting inside a Pittsburgh synagogue as a “wicked act of pure evil and anti-Semitic,” and for the fourth consecutive day condemned political violence. 252 Democrats and Republicans are launching new criticisms over the Affordable Care Act and pre-existing conditions coverage. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis approved a request from the Department of Homeland Security to deploy additional U.S. troops along the U.S.-Mexico border—as the administration weighed additional steps to combat illegal immigration. 253 U.S. and other government’s officials said the uproar over a Saudi journalist’s grisly death has put Saudi Arabia’s ability to rally others against Iran at risk, posing a challenge for the Trump administration’s Middle East policy.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH – The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 7:20 a.m. A rabbi who helped alert authorities to the synagogue shooting that killed 11 people says it was because of recent security training that he had a cellphone on him and was able to make the call. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh said Monday on ABC's "Good Morning America" that he hadn't always carried a cellphone on the Sabbath. But he says a security expert had told him in August that he was living in a new era and needed to carry it. Myers says that he spent 20 minutes on the phone with authorities and that it "felt like an eternity." Shooting suspect Robert Gregory Bowers is due in federal court Monday. Authorities say he expressed hatred toward Jews during the rampage Saturday and in later comments to police. ___ 6 a.m. Survivors are recounting the terror of hiding in a dark closet during the massacre that killed 11 at a Pittsburgh synagogue and asking why the gunman blames them for the world's problems. Suspect Robert Gregory Bowers is expected to appear in federal court Monday. Authorities say he expressed hatred toward Jews during the rampage Saturday morning and in later comments to police. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says federal prosecutors intend to pursue the death penalty. Barry Werber says members of the synagogue's New Light Congregation were in the basement and beginning to pray when they heard crashing coming from upstairs. They looked out and saw a body on the staircase. Werber says he called 911 but was afraid to say anything for fear of making noise as gunshots echoed upstairs.

A Pittsburgh Steelers logo with one of the hypocycloids changed to a Star of David, on a banner at Heinz Field for Sunday's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) One man created a special twist on the Pittsburgh Steelers logo after a mass shooting unfolded at a synagogue in the Steel City. Tim Hindes, a full-time graphic designer and marketer, told Fox News: "I wanted it to be a symbol of remembrance, but more so, to be a message of hope. That we're together." Hindes called the creation of the logo -- which includes the Star of David -- his "proudest moment to date." He also shared the story behind the design in a lengthy Facebook post. Hindes said he helped some friends move into their home before he looked on his phone — and saw there had been a shooting “at a synagogue a mile away from where we were packing.” “My heart sunk,” he admitted. “Unfortunately, it wasn't because of the shooting, but because (I had feared) it was fueled by hate.” Hindes explained that one of his friends recently had been the target of anti-Semitic verbal abuse. “I had been disturbed by these events all week long and it seemed that I was seeing these same remarks now being played out in horrific fashion in front of me,” he wrote. At one point, he said, he started to doodle. PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING VICTIMS IDENTIFIED AS BROTHERS, HUSBAND AND WIFE KILLED IN 'UNSPEAKABLE AND HATEFUL CRIME' “Before it was the logo of a globally popular football team, the three diamonds were the seal of a product which helped develop the foundation of many cities across the globe--steel,” Hindes wrote. “Like Pittsburgh and its residents, steel is strong. It was a perfect basis for an image of hope.” He added that it “was natural” for his take on the logo to feature the six-pointed star. “The Jewish community is a thread throughout Pittsburgh's foundation and an important and diverse part of my fantastic city,” he shared. Hindes also wrote about the strength of Pittsburgh’s residents, who he said “don’t get rattled easily.” PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE SUSPECT TOLD OFFICERS 'I JUST WANT TO KILL JEWS,' AFFIDAVIT SAYS “This fortitude was instilled in our community by our pierogi-pinching grandmothers,” he said. “We were strong before this tragedy. A tragedy like this just makes us stronger. Just like you can't break steel, you can't break the resiliency of a Pittsburgher. We are stronger than hate.” Hindes concluded the post by saying he's praying for those killed, along with their families and the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. “I hope this small symbol demonstrates that you are not alone in your mourning and that we all love you,” he wrote.

Authorities believe alleged gunman Robert Bowers acted alone and was driven by his hatred of Jews; David Lee Miller reports from Pittsburg on what more is being learned about the suspect. The victims of the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh included a grandfather, a husband and wife, and two brothers, officials and family members revealed as new details about the alleged gunman behind the deadly rampage were released Sunday. The Tree of Live victims were identified as Joyce Fienberg, 75, of Oakland; Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township; Rose Mallinger, 97, of Squirrel Hill; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill; David Rosenthal, 54, of Squirrel Hill; Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg; Sylvan Simon, 87, of Wilkinsburg; Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill; Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill; and Irving Younger, 69, of Mount Washington. President Trump ordered flags at federal locations throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. In a proclamation, Trump declared: “I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, October 31, 2018. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.” U.S. Attorney Scott Brady called the massacre an “unspeakable and hateful crime" during a news conference, adding that alleged gunman Robert Gregory Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people during the shooting rampage. A gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing multiple people. Here’s what you need to know about the tragedy. One of the first victims to be identified by family members was 71-year-old Dan Stein, who once served as the president of the New Light Congregation, which holds services at the Tree of Life Synagogue where the shooting took place. “He was very active and he did everything,” Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “He was there every Saturday for services.” Stein recently became a grandfather and was remembered as someone always willing to help others. Daniel Stein, 71, was among those killed in the massacre. (Facebook) “He was always willing to help anybody,” Halle told the paper. “He was somebody that everybody liked, very dry sense of humor and recently had a grandson who loved him.” SUBSCRIBE TO FOX NEWS FIRST -- YOUR BRIEFING ON ALL THE STORIES TO START THE DAY Cecil and David Rosenthal were brothers and both perished in the rampage, according to Allegheny County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams. Bernice and Sylvan Simon were married and were also among the dead in the rampage, he added. A friend of Melvin Wax told the Associated Press that the retired accountant was a "sweet, sweet guy," and a pillar of the New Light Congregation that rented space on the lower level of the synagogue. "He was such a kind, kind person," Myron Snider, chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee, told the AP. "When my daughters were younger, they would go to him, and he would help them with their federal income tax every year. Never charged them. Gideon Murphy places a flower at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." Snider said Wax, who was slightly hard of hearing, was a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He went Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, when there were Sunday services," said Snider, a retired pharmacist. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person." The Tree of Life Congregation where a deadly shooting took place on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh. ((Andrew Stein/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP) Jerry Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician, was known for his uplifting demeanor, according to former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus. In an email sent to his former coworkers on Sunday, Claus passed along his condolences to Rabinowitz's family, saying "he was truly a trusted confidant and healer." The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a retired nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning and sustained critical injuries to his chest, he said. Daniel Leger was seriously injured in the shooting. (Facebook) “I don’t think it really quite struck home," Paul Leger told the Tribune-Review. "This is something like on TV.” Pittsburgh police said in an arrest affidavit made public early Sunday that Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. Bowers was being treated for his injuries when he said Jews were "committing genocide to his people," and that he wanted them all to die. Bowers walked into the synagogue during Sabbath services on Saturday morning armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns before opening fire, killing 11 people and wounding six. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. WHO IS ROBERT BOWERS? PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SUSPECT POSTED VIEWS ONLINE Police later traded gunfire with Bowers, who was shot multiple times but survived. Four police officers were among the wounded. Bowers faces 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation in addition to federal counts that include weapons offenses and hate crime charges.

Puskar)) Robert Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said it may take up to a week to process the crime scene. Bowers has an initial appearance in federal court scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Monday. "This was a large, complex crime scene and much work remains to be done," he said at a news conference. A search of Bowers' home in Baldwin has been conducted, but officials have not disclosed what was discovered inside. There is also nothing to indicate that Bowers had any accomplices, he added. "We don’t know why he picked this synagogue," Jones said. Former FBI special agent Maureen O’Connell weighs in. The attack took place just before 10 a.m. in the residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Peter Hart, who has lived a few blocks from the synagogue for just over three decades, told Fox News on Saturday said it's "a very tight community," and the rampage was "a shock." "It’s not that Pittsburgh has no crime, it’s not that, but among the safest neighborhoods is the neighborhood that this happened in," Hart told Fox News.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-week-of-american-hate-bombs-mailed-black-americans-executed-jews-slaughtered_us_5bd4cd3be4b055bc948c9805---split---A man executed two black people at a grocery store, but didn’t engage a white man outside because “whites don’t shoot whites.” A Donald Trump supporter and apparent anti-Semite who looked up to white supremacists sent bombs in the mail to the president’s opposition. An avowed anti-Semite walked into a synagogue and killed 11 people after screaming, “All Jews must die!” This was one week in American hate. Some of the bloodiest and most excruciatingly tense news stories in recent memory felt painfully similar to one another, unified under the same banner of racism, violent rhetoric and anger. The only difference between this week and the last is that a few of the angry, hateful people under that banner decided to go out and act on their hate. On Monday, packages containing apparent pipe bombs began to arrive at the doorsteps and offices of high-profile Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and former CIA Director John Brennan. The first showed up at a home owned by George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has been the right’s favorite punching bag, conspiracy catchall and boogeyman for decades. Five days passed, and more packages arrived. The news media pointed out that all of the victims were Trump’s public enemies, and that he’d prodded his followers to commit violence against some of them in the past. Conservatives ― including the president himself ― implied or outright stated that the bombs were a so-called false-flag operation committed by the Democrats. That, of course, turned out to be untrue. On Friday, police arrested Cesar Sayoc, 56, who was revealed to be a staunch Trump supporter and wild conspiracy theorist. His sticker-covered van suggests he committed his alleged crimes in the president’s name; some of the stickers on his van featured targets on the faces of his victims, while others were loving homages to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Trump, meanwhile, would go back to making fun of Soros by Friday night. But Sayoc also had plain old hate in his heart. His former boss revealed to HuffPost on Saturday that he looked up to the white supremacists of old ― despite flaunting his claimed Native American heritage, which the Seminole Tribe has denied ― and wished “to go back to the Hitler days.” Initially lost in that news cycle was a shooting at a Kroger in Kentucky on Wednesday. That two people died in a shooting at a grocery store wasn’t a huge surprise ― 96 people are killed by guns every day in America and hundreds more are shot ― but later it became clear that this particular shooting was a little different. Gregory Alan Bush allegedly shot a black man in the back of the head at the grocery store, shot him several more times as he lay on the ground, and then walked outside, where he shot and killed a black woman. There wasn’t an official motive on the books as of Saturday, but a witness who was armed at the time told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Bush uttered “whites don’t kill whites” as he passed by “nonchalantly.” Later it was revealed that he’d tried and failed to enter a predominantly black church minutes earlier. Suddenly, this regular American shooting story became a regular American hate story too. And then on Saturday, American hate came full circle. An anti-Semite named Robert Bowers allegedly walked into a synagogue in Pittsburgh, screamed “All Jews must die!” and then shot and killed at least 11 people and wounded more. Scans of Bowers’ social media activity ― mostly on Gab, a hub for the likes of violent neo-Nazis ― reveal that he despised Jews and subscribed to various conspiracy theories about a migrant caravan in Mexico. His anger and anxiety, fueled by the idea that Jews were bringing immigrants into the country to displace white people, ended in what’s being called the “deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” Bowers’ hate was the same as the others’. It was blind; it was given tacit endorsement through violent rhetoric coming from our pundits and our president; and it had a strong community in which to fester and grow. His act capped off a week in which hate showed what it is truly capable of in America. This story has been updated to clarify that the Seminole Tribe has denied Sayoc’s claims of Seminole heritage.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pittsburgh-mayor-trump-armed-guards_us_5bd5cf25e4b055bc948d01c1---split---Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) on Sunday dismissed President Donald Trump’s suggestion of adding “armed guards” to houses of worship in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue a day earlier. Peduto, during an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” instead urged Congress to pass stricter gun laws to prevent similar attacks in the future. “I don’t think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or our schools filled with armed guards,” Peduto said. “We should try to stop irrational behavior from happening at the forefront.” WATCH: Chuck asks Pittsburgh Mayor @billpeduto what he needs from President Trump after the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue. #MTP Peduto: "I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards." pic.twitter.com/sExD5DVZ7l Hours after a gunman opened fire at the synagogue Saturday, killing at least 11 people, Trump told reporters that gun control had “little to do” with the attack. “If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him,” the president claimed. Trump has repeatedly called for arming more people in response to mass shootings. After the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, Trump suggested “giving concealed guns to adept teachers.” But Peduto on Sunday threw cold water on Trump’s call for more guns in response to mass shootings. “We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior,” he continued. “We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing.” He continued: “I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns ― which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America ― out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder.” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto: "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns -- which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America -- out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder." #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/2avlb9Wosu Pittsburgh City Council members Corey O’Connor and Erika Strassburger echoed Peduto’s comments during an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “That’s not the community we want ― we don’t want people having armed guards in every door you walk into,” O’Connor said. “That’s not the type of community that we want to live in.” Strassburger added, “Where do we stop with arming our entire society and feeling as if we can’t be safe anywhere?

---split---4.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMI7rigMwlq88?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---Until recent years, many Jews in America believed that the worst of anti-Semitism was over there, in Europe, a vestige of the old country. American Jews were welcome in universities, country clubs and corporate boards that once excluded their grandparents. They married non-Jews, moved into mixed neighborhoods and by 2000, the first Jew ran for vice president on a major party ticket. So the massacre on Saturday of 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, by a man who told the police when he surrendered that he “wanted all Jews to die,” was for many a shocking wake-up call. “This kind of evil mak... David and Cecil Rosenthal, brothers in their 50s, were almost always in the synagogue, greeting everyone who came with a “Good Shabbos” and a ready prayer book. Joyce Fienberg, 75, prayed there every day after her husband’s death. And Melvin Wax, 88, took on so many tasks — from leading services to changing light bulbs — that one friend described his role there as “everything but the cantor.” The shooting rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue left 11 people dead, including the Rosenthal brothers, Ms. Fienberg and Mr. Wax. Many of those who perished were advanced in years. Some, like Rose Ma...

PITTSBURGH — Robert Bowers, the man accused of gunning down 11 congregants in a virulently anti-Semitic rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue, was an isolated, awkward man who lived alone and struggled with basic human interactions, neighbors and others who knew him said on Sunday. “He was in his own little world,” said Jim Brinsky, 46, a friend from childhood. Mr. Brinsky said he and Mr. Bowers, 46, grew up together but that he never met Mr. Bowers’s parents and got the impression that Mr. Bowers had a difficult home life. As teenagers, he said they built pipe bombs and blew up watermelons and... WASHINGTON — For months, Republican officials have complained privately that President Trump lacks the ability to confront moments of crisis with moral clarity, choosing to inflame the divisions that have torn the country apart rather than try to bring it together. It took the importuning of his Jewish daughter and son-in-law to craft a powerful statement of outrage at anti-Semitism after Saturday’s slaughter at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Then Mr. Trump went back into partisan mode, assailing his enemies. By the evening’s end he was tweeting about baseball, and on Sunday he went after another ... Early Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers’s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online. But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Mr. Bowers wrote. “... RIO DE JANEIRO — Had the blade slashed a bit more of Jair Bolsonaro’s abdomen, the evangelical preacher who came to see him in the hospital might have had to prepare a eulogy about his friend’s presidential hopes being dashed by the same plague of violence that fueled his stunning rise.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil on Sunday became the latest country to drift toward the far right, electing a strident populist as president in the nation’s most radical political change since democracy was restored more than 30 years ago. The president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, has exalted the country’s military dictatorship, advocated torture and threatened to destroy, jail or drive into exile his political opponents. He won by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in Brazil — a country whiplashed by rising crime and two years of political and economic turmoil — and by presenting ... Jair Bolsonaro’s climb to power has been marked by divisive rhetoric and offensive speech that has thrilled followers and appalled critics in equal measure. The far-right former army captain’s rise has left some baffled. Mr. Bolsonaro served seven consecutive terms in Congress, with little to show for his time there; very few of his bills were approved. But many Brazilians, angered by their country’s economic crisis, soaring violence and corruption scandals, interpreted his long list of caustic remarks as blunt but bracingly honest talk from a man willing to say — and do — whatever was nece... JAKARTA, Indonesia — A plane carrying 189 people from Jakarta to a smaller Indonesian city crashed into the Java Sea on Monday, prompting hard questions about the safety of the skies over a vast island nation dependent on air travel.

WASHINGTON — Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for President Trump’s planned re-election effort in 2020, has never run another political race of any kind. Republican establishment figures are watching him closely, in some cases quietly hoping he stumbles. And he is working for a famously mercurial boss whose 2016 campaign had three shake-ups over six months. But Mr. Parscale believes he is the man for the moment, uniquely equipped to manage the potentially fractious relationships inside the campaign and sell voters on the idea of sticking with an unorthodox president. “I might not be the ... Welcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Monday that she would not seek re-election and would give up the leadership of her conservative party, as Europe’s most powerful leader began to prepare for her long-expected departure from office. Ms. Merkel, 64, who has led the Christian Democratic Union for 18 years and the country for 13, also said she would not seek any other political office.

And on Sunday, the Red Sox completed the seven-month marathon by cementing their status atop the sport and among the greatest teams of all time. Riding the left arm of David Price and the powerful swings of Steve Pearce, the Red Sox easily dispatched ... LOS ANGELES — Steve Pearce joined the party in progress. The Boston Red Sox added him in a trade in June, a month before the nonwaiver trading deadline, just in time to face a Yankees left-hander in the Bronx. Pearce doubled in his first at-bat. He had always been curious about life as a member of the Red Sox. He was born and raised in Lakeland, Fla., but he rooted for the Boston sports teams because his family had roots in New England. “I was brainwashed as a kid,” he said. On Sunday at Dodger Stadium, in Game 5 of the World Series, Pearce helped his adopted fan base add another jewel to i... WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has freed an American citizen whom the military imprisoned without trial for more than 13 months as a suspected Islamic State member, United States officials said on Monday. His release brings a close to a legal saga that raised novel issues about the scope of the government’s national security powers and individual rights. The man, a dual American and Saudi citizen, was captured in September 2017 by a Kurdish militia in Syria. The Kurds turned him over to the American military, which held him as a wartime detainee at a base in Iraq while a court battle... (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

What is going on in this country? Can’t we be safe in our homes, in our schools, in our most sacred places? Once again, Americans are left to ask each other these sorts of questions, after a gunman burst into the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on the Jewish Sabbath and opened fire on families in the contemplation of their faith. Armed with an automatic rifle and three handguns, he killed 11 people and wounded six more, including four police officers. “Jews must die,” he was said to have shouted. The attack came a day after a man was arrested in Florida for mailing pipe bombs to politi... They don’t even try very hard to hide it. President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit. They are accepting sweetheart deals from foreigners. And they are harnessing the power of the federal government on behalf of their businesses. There’s a word for this: corruption. Given how widespread Trumpian corruption has become, we thought it was time to make a list. It’s meant to be a definitive list of self-dealing by the president, his family, his staff or his friends — sin... This has been a very difficult 24 hours for the Jewish community — and for America. What started as a normal Sabbath for Jews — a time to be with family and community, celebrate bar and bat mitzvahs, hold baby namings, pray to God — ended with news of the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. This was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. While the horror of this massacre is shocking, it is not entirely surprising. At the Anti-Defamation League, we have been tracking and fighting anti-Semitism for over a century. And while Jews have enjoyed a degree of accep... SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Jair Bolsonaro, an ultraright wing populist, was elected president on Sunday. As I processed this new reality, I looked out my window and watched the celebratory fireworks illuminate the night sky. In the distance, I made out one of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters holding up a sign that said, “Ustra Lives.” It was a chilling reminder of our past. From 1970 to 1974, Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra was the head of the DOI-CODI, the intelligence agency responsible for stamping out critics during military rule. He oversaw the torture of political dissidents while they were detaine... On Oct. 23, three days after Saudi Arabia admitted that its agents had killed the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, headlined a session at an economic conference in Riyadh from which many Western politicians and executives had withdrawn. In September, when Mr. Khan visited Saudi Arabia seeking aid for his battered economy, he left empty-handed. But last week, as global outrage intensified over Mr. Khashoggi’s murder, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called Mr. Khan, asking him to attend the conference. Mr. Khan accepted and returned with $6 billion... Our national dialogue about diversity and inclusion, about acceptance and egalitarianism, is poisoned, and Donald Trump is holding a rather large pouch of poison. Last week, we saw the arrest of a Trump supporter who sent pipe bombs through the mail to people who were frequent rhetorical targets of the president, many of them prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. Then on Saturday came a mass shooting at a Jewish synagogue by a rabid anti-Semite. As NBC reported: “The shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh — in which the death toll now stands at 11 — is ... PITTSBURGH — More than a third of this city is Catholic. The bishop always interrupts his Midnight Mass processional — stopping at the seventh row from the altar every Christmas Eve — to give a hug to the rabbi whose synagogue is down the street from the cathedral. There are six kosher food establishments in a two-block area of town. Yet the city’s signature sandwich is an unkosher mess of meat and creamy coleslaw, with fries mashed atop the glop. The garment of choice every Friday before a Steelers game is a black-and-gold Ben Roethlisberger or Antonio Brown shirt. Hours later, at sundown,... NASHVILLE — The best thing about fall in Tennessee is the clarity of the light: The shadows at day’s end grow long and then longer, and the dry soil throws out motes of dust that catch in the sunset and seem to burst into flame. All autumn is on fire — sourwood and red maple and poison sumac and witch hazel and oakleaf hydrangea. Sunset lights them all on fire at the end of the day. The red berries of the dogwood trees and the red seedpods of the magnolias flare up, too, and so do the berries of the bush honeysuckle, invasive but still ineffably beautiful in the failing light at the end of ... With the midterm election just a week away, citizens who are concerned about the fate of country are making their final push to get out the vote. Since 2016, they have joined grass-roots organizations, made phone calls to swing states and targeted donations to help campaigns pay for organizers. Volunteers are doing hard, often unrecognized, work, knocking on doors and engaging one voter at a time.

SYDNEY, Australia — In 1985, the Australian entrepreneur Paul Ramsay took a tour of Nottoway Plantation in Louisiana. So impressed was he with the luxurious “white castle” mansion and its grounds that he decided to buy it right there and then. In Mr. Ramsay’s hands, the property became a popular tourist attraction and resort. The resort’s website continues to revel in Nottoway’s antebellum glory days, while neglecting to make any mention of the slave labor from which it was built. A similar desire to whitewash the past informs the institution that Paul Ramsay has left Australians as his leg... EAST WINDSOR, N.J. — For many years, I have wished more Americans would know about HIAS. Now I am heartbroken by why they will. The man charged with killing 11 people on Saturday at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh posted a message online just a few hours before the massacre: “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Many Americans are now wondering what HIAS is and who it brings to America. I first heard of those four letters in 1989, when I was nine years old and my family fled anti-... It was the giant whiteboard that did it, they said. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed their homes in October 2012, many Long Islanders fell hard for Cody Trey Lawrence, a sweet-talking contractor from Texas. To pitch the services of Turnkey Contractor Solutions, the company he partly owned, he used a whiteboard the size of a picture window to lay out his project management prowess. He detailed how he kept track of each home elevation and reconstruction project. In the chaotic years after the storm that left thousands of people shifting from one temporary location to the next, the Turnkey whit...

Writers may be familiar with that peculiar sensation that comes in a moment of crisis, trauma or transition when you simultaneously feel all the feelings of that instant and also know, with bone-marrow certainty, that you will one day turn this moment into art. For the “Transparent” creator Jill Soloway, that moment came in 2011 when the author’s father came out as transgender. The phone call, and the ways in which the news changed not just Soloway’s father, but the entire family, inspired ... AVENTURA, Fla. — The estranged family of Cesar Sayoc, the drifter accused of mailing more than a dozen bombs to critics of President Trump, tried to plead with him on Sunday to accept mental health care and hire a proficient lawyer to represent him in the case, which could lead to his imprisonment for decades. “I thank God he hasn’t hurt anybody,” Tina Villasana, Mr. Sayoc’s youngest sister, said in an interview, the first extended public remarks by a close relative since Mr. Sayoc was arrested on Friday. The family’s attempted intervention came the day before Mr. Sayoc was scheduled to app... A Fox Business Network executive on Sunday condemned the appearance of a guest on one of the network’s leading shows, “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” after the guest’s remarks were linked to anti-Semitism. The guest, Chris Farrell of the conservative Washington group Judicial Watch, claimed the caravan of refugees now traveling in southern Mexico was funded by George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor who has frequently figured in right-wing and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Mr. Soros, who is Jewish, was also accused by Mr. Farrell of influencing the State Department. The epi... IBM is making a big move to bring more software developers under its wing by acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the popular open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion. The purchase, announced on Sunday afternoon, is the latest competitive step among large business-software companies seeking an edge in the fast-growing market for cloud computing. In June, Microsoft acquired GitHub, a major code-sharing platform for software developers, for $7.5 billion. With the deal for Red Hat, IBM is trying to position itself as a kind of corporate “Switzerland” in cloud computing — a ... The Rev. Thomas Keating, a Trappist monk and a pioneer in the worldwide Christian contemplative prayer movement, died on Thursday at St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Mass., where he had once been abbot. He was 95. His nephew Peter C. Jones confirmed the death and said Father Keating had been in declining health for several years. The arc of his life took Father Keating from riches to rags and back to riches again, Mr. Jones said in a telephone interview: He was born into affluence and privilege in Manhattan, walked away from it all when he entered an austere monastic community in Rhode Island... Ntozake Shange, a spoken-word artist who morphed into a playwright with her canonical play “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,” died on Saturday in Bowie, Md. She was 70. Her death was confirmed by her sister Ifa Bayeza, who said she had been in fragile health since a pair of strokes more than a decade ago. Only 27 years old when “For Colored Girls” opened at the Booth Theater in 1976, Ms. Shange was a Broadway rarity on two counts: She was black and she was a woman. But her unconventional play was a hit and nominated for a Tony Award. A series of searin... Football coaches across New Jersey, which has packed lineups with N.F.L. stars for decades, are asking the same question this fall: Where have all the players gone? Rich Hansen, the football coach and athletic director for 31 years at perennial power St. Peter’s Prep in Jersey City, began listing off the schools he knew of that had struggled to field a team in a state that has long been a college recruiting hotbed. “Glen Ridge, Marist, Montclair Immaculate, Montclair Kimberley, Morris Catholic, Dickinson — it’s an epidemic,” Hansen said. The latest active participation numbers, which were r... When he campaigned for president in 1976, Jimmy Carter often invoked the late theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his admonition that “the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.” That sort of faith-inflected speech from a major national politician was new to most voters. So was the candidate himself, a former Georgia governor who taught Sunday school and described himself as born again, an obscure term for many millions of Americans. Mr. Carter managed, narrowly, to win that first post-Watergate national election. As president, he put liberal aspects of his Baptist trad... It took 24 years, but a woman who was raped in a Brooklyn park and then maligned by police officials and a columnist who doubted her story has received what she wanted: a formal apology from the New York City police commissioner. The commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said in a letter released on Sunday that the treatment of the woman and the handling of the case amounted to a “miscarriage of justice.” Police officials, quoted by a columnist in The Daily News, cast aspersions on the woman’s report of being dragged off a path in Prospect Park in broad daylight and raped at knife point on April ... ROCKVILLE, Md. — During halftime at Georgetown Preparatory School’s homecoming football game on Saturday, a group of students swiped through photos on their phones as they waited in a long line for burgers and fries.

FAIRFAX, Calif. — Anne Lamott thought “Doomed” was a pretty good name for her latest book, but it was a hard sell to the powers that be at Riverhead, her longtime publisher, so she settled on a less apocalyptic title, one she couldn’t quite remember on this bright Northern California afternoon. “Something … Anything?” she said. Not quite. “Almost Everything: Notes on Hope,” out last week, is Lamott’s 18th book — and 15th best-seller — and her ninth collection of mostly spiritual essays. Like a feminist C.S.

I hold my 4-year-old daughter’s hand as she lies on the cold surface of the X-ray table, watching her brow furrow as she concentrates on holding her left ankle at the awkward angle in which the technician placed it. This is, for her, an exciting experience, something about which she feels only curiosity. She asks questions, interested in the machine’s unseen rays, eventually expressing dismay as it becomes apparent that these events will unfold without something new for her to feel or see. But it’s hard for me to focus on anything besides the slight bump that I can see on her left shinbone ... LEICESTER, England — By Sunday morning, half a dozen bouquets of flowers had been placed against a wall outside King Power Stadium. Leaning next to them was a framed portrait of Ganesha, the god of beginnings, the remover of obstacles. A handful of Leicester City fans stood a few yards from the makeshift shrine, their heads bowed. They could not quite put into words what had drawn them there. At that stage, they were not certain if they were there to pray and to hope, or simply to mourn. They came in grief, in its cruelest form: grief that offers still a glimmer of a reprieve. It was not un... I love the versatility of the unassuming cauliflower. In vegetable terms, it’s a blank canvas. That’s not to say it’s flavorless, but cauliflower’s relatively mild personality is ready to be transformed in combination with a vast number of other flavorful ingredients. Its nature is to absorb and comply. One easy and delicious way to prepare cauliflower is to steam or boil it, then anoint it. Cook thick slices until just done and arrange them on a plate. Drizzle them with fruity extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. This is... It’s only fitting that Rattlestick Playwrights Theater would gut its Greenwich Village home to accommodate the unconventional production of “Lewiston/Clarkston” that opened there on Thursday. The 24-year-old company merely did for Samuel D. Hunter’s new play what the play will do to you. Make that “plays.” “Lewiston” and “Clarkston,” though thematically intertwined, are stand-alone 90-minute works, here produced in one evening that includes a sit-down dinner during the half-hour intermission. You can bring your own meal, or reserve a catered one with your ticket, but either way you’ll need ... Twenty years ago, George Zeppenfeldt-Cestero left his job as a hospital administrator in New York to open a one-person health care consulting firm. Since he was losing his employee medical coverage, he shopped around and bought a private health insurance plan through Aetna. It was expensive, with premiums starting at about $1,000 a month, but “it paid for all my doctors’ visits and my medications,” he said. “I was a satisfied consumer.” But several years ago, Aetna informed him that it was discontinuing that plan, sending him scrambling for another insurer. That’s when, applying for coverag... More than 400 million years ago, ancient oceans were teeming with many fish that might seem alien in today’s seas. Back then some wore plates of bony armor and lacked jaws, like the arandaspids, which looked like a clam with a tail. The heterostracans sometimes resembled underwater armadillos with spikes. There were also galeaspids, some of which sported swordlike helmets, and the osteostracans, which had horseshoe-shaped heads. Not all jawless fish were heavily armored. The thelodonts, for example, had torpedo-shaped bodies and bony scales that looked like shark skin. Some anaspids had sca... Ten minutes of mild, almost languorous exercise can immediately alter how certain parts of the brain communicate and coordinate with one another and improve memory function, according to an encouraging new neurological study. The findings suggest that exercise does not need to be prolonged or intense to benefit the brain and that the effects can begin far more quickly than many of us might expect. We already know that exercise can change our brains and minds. The evidence is extensive and growing. Multiple studies with mice and rats have found that when the animals run on wheels or treadmil...

But the truth is Bolsonaro, who swept to election victory Sunday night, is much more extreme. The far-right has conquered the world's fourth biggest democracy, and the consequences of that will stretch far beyond Brazil.

Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), dogged by an ethics scandal, dropped his bid for re-election just weeks before the vote, saying that he didn’t want to cause further harm to his party and imperil its control of the chamber. He was replaced by former Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), who won the race like all New Jersey Senate Democrats have since 1972. Sixteen years later, Sen.

Gab.com is a social network that touts itself as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook to give conservatives a platform for free speech. But it has also been criticized for providing a platform for anti-Semitism and white nationalism. The site has come in for increased scrutiny since the shooting. As of Monday, the site displayed a message saying it had been "systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors." "We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed at Pittsburgh," it said. The platform's future is newly in doubt because an account linked to Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident charged in the shootings, wrote on Gab Saturday morning: "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." HIAS is the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish nonprofit group that has the goal of helping immigrant refugees. In an interview with NPR, Gab CEO and founder Andrew Torba defended his website and condemned the shooting in Pittsburgh. He said the site has a rule about removing direct threats, but he suggested that Bowers' posting didn't sound like a concrete threat. "I don't know. Do you see a direct threat in there? Because I don't. What would you expect us to do with a post like that? You want us to just censor anybody who says the phrase 'I'm going in'? Because that's just absurd," Torba said. "And here's the thing: The answer to bad speech, or hate speech, however you want to define that, is more speech. And it always will be." PayPal confirmed to NPR that it had cut off the website off from its payment system. And two web-hosting sites also severed ties with Gab over the weekend. Torba told NPR he would work to keep the platform going. But hours later, gab.com was down with a statement posted. "As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online," according to the statement on Gab's website. The mechanics of what caused the website to be taken down were not clear early Monday, but websites depend on support from with Web-hosting providers.

Since then it has grown from 300,000 users in November of last year to about 800,000 today, the company says. In a filing with the SEC in March, the site's operators said they expected to appeal to "over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users" who use sites like Breitbart, DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com as people leave social networks that "censor conservative views."

Gab.com is a social network that touts itself as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook to give conservatives a platform for free speech. But it has also been criticized for providing a platform for anti-Semitism and white nationalism. The site has come in for increased scrutiny since the shooting. As of Monday, the site displayed a message saying it had been "systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors." "We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed at Pittsburgh," it said. The platform's future is newly in doubt because an account linked to Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident charged in the shootings, wrote on Gab Saturday morning: "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in." HIAS is the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish nonprofit group that has the goal of helping immigrant refugees. In an interview with NPR, Gab CEO and founder Andrew Torba defended his website and condemned the shooting in Pittsburgh. He said the site has a rule about removing direct threats, but he suggested that Bowers' posting didn't sound like a concrete threat. "I don't know. Do you see a direct threat in there? Because I don't. What would you expect us to do with a post like that? You want us to just censor anybody who says the phrase 'I'm going in'? Because that's just absurd," Torba said. "And here's the thing: The answer to bad speech, or hate speech, however you want to define that, is more speech. And it always will be." PayPal confirmed to NPR that it had cut off the website off from its payment system. And two web-hosting sites also severed ties with Gab over the weekend. Torba told NPR he would work to keep the platform going. But hours later, gab.com was down with a statement posted. "As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online," according to the statement on Gab's website. The mechanics of what caused the website to be taken down were not clear early Monday, but websites depend on support from with Web-hosting providers. It was also not clear how long the site would stay down. https://t.co/J3Rfto6fi3 Statement On The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting https://t.co/XU9Apd0cUD A casual scroll through Gab's message boards while it was up over the weekend revealed plenty of anti-Semitism, racism, Nazism and sexism running through its messages, along with conspiracy theories.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-pittsburgh-synagogue-mass-shooting_us_5bd671d3e4b0a8f17ef928f9---split---I understand what Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf was trying to do with his statement immediately following Saturday’s mass murder at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. When he said, “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans,” he was saying that this horrific event ― a hate-fueled massacre of innocents in an American house of worship ― does not reflect our national character. And I get it. It’s gut-churning to think what happened there is a reflection of all of us, as opposed to the work of a lone, depraved actor. But here’s the problem: It is who we are. Or, at least, a large part of who we are. Now, I’m not saying every American is a gun-toting mass killer who spews anti-Semitic hatred online. But, as soothing as it is to think of the events in Pittsburgh as something outside of our national identity, this simply isn’t true. Gov. Wolf’s line, which he repeated in a press conference, is a statement of fantasy, not fact. This attack was fueled by religious prejudice. And we are a nation with hate and prejudice encoded in its DNA. If you don’t believe me, read about the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, or the slaves who helped build the White House and U.S. Capitol. Study virtually anything about this nation’s treatment of Native Americans. Brush up on the Chinese Exclusion Act or Japanese internment or anti-LGBTQ+ violence. Go to the newly opened National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which honors “thousands of racial terror lynching victims in the United States,” or read about the spike in anti-Semitic incidents in recent years, including a swastika painted on a sign at a temple in Rhode Island just a few miles from where I live. This is who we are. We are also a nation that glorifies guns. Today, there are more than 390 million civilian-owned firearms in the U.S., which, as The Washington Post recently noted, is “enough for every man, woman and child to own one and still have 67 million guns left over.” America is a land of gun festivals and gun museums and gun-toting church services and phones that look like guns and guns that look like phones. We are a country where politicians fire guns in campaign ads and presidential candidates tweet photos of guns etched with their name, along with the simple caption: “America.” Our largest and most outspoken pro-gun organization has its own TV network. In 2016, 37,000 people died in this country from gun violence, second in the world behind Brazil. This is who we are. Our gun obsession and refusal to significantly regulate firearms have led ― predictably, you might say ― to a string of mass shootings in almost every conceivable public place: nightclubs, elementary schools, high schools, community colleges, state universities, military bases, supermarkets, airports, nursing homes, Planned Parenthood clinics, cafes, IHOPs, Waffle Houses, coffee shops, malls and hotels. According to Mother Jones, There have been more than 100 of these events (indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims) since 1982, and Saturday’s attack wasn’t the first mass shooting at a religious site in recent memory. Think of the 2012 attack at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, or Charleston in 2015, or Sutherland Springs, Texas, where, less than a year ago, 26 people lost their lives in a Baptist Church. The Pittsburgh shooting wasn’t even the only act of hate-fueled violence last week. On Friday, the FBI arrested a suspect in a hate-fueled mail bombing campaign targeting CNN and anti-Trump political figures, including two former presidents. The shooting of two African Americans by a white man in a Kentucky supermarket earlier in the week is now being investigated as a hate crime, which, if true, would make it part of a rising trend of hate crimes. This is who we are. Again, I’m not saying that all of us are hateful and violent, or that American history is filled solely with scenes of hate-fueled horror. (Although there sure are a lot of them.) But I am ― emphatically ― saying that, in October of 2018, when a public official responds to a hate-fueled mass shooting by denying its place in our society, it defies reality. Too many people have been lost to similar acts to keep saying that; it dishonors their memory to ignore glaringly visible patterns. We need to be honest, even when it makes us uncomfortable. We are long past the time for platitudes. And I don’t mean to pick on Gov. Wolf, because the problem is much bigger than him. We boast about our freedom while locking people up at a higher rate than any other country. We talk about our superior quality of life while we face more than a trillion dollars in student debt, stagnant wages, and dropping life expectancy. One of our most highly paid media personalities apparently just learned that it’s not OK to wear blackface on Halloween. We excel at delusional self-flattery. But it’s time to stop. Hatred and violence and firearms are deeply embedded in our national psyche. For the sake of you, me, and everyone else in this country, I wish this weren’t true ― but that’s different from saying it isn’t true. If we truly want to become the country Gov. Wolf describes, we first need to face reality: This is who we are. Philip Eil is a freelance journalist based in Providence, Rhode Island.
---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-patrols-synagogues-20181027-story.html---split---Los Angeles police increased patrols around synagogues and other places of worship Saturday in the wake of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We are monitoring the situation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania very closely and communicating with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners,” the LAPD tweeted. “Right now there is no apparent connection to Los Angeles.” “However, out of an abundance of caution you will see extra patrols around houses of worship today. Remember if you see something...say something.” Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted a similar message of caution, saying “we are reaching out to Jewish community leaders. We mourn with #TreeOfLife community today.” Authorities in Pittsburgh said there were 11 fatalities in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the center of the city’s Jewish community. Four police officers were also shot. The suspected gunman was in custody and identified as Robert Bowers, 46, law enforcement officials said. The incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters. A law enforcement official told CNN that the shooter made anti-Jewish comments during the incident. Amanda Susskind, Los Angeles regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said anti-Semitic incidents were up by 57% nationwide in 2016-17. Still, she said the shooting surprised her. “It never stops being shocking and horrifying when something like this happens,” she said. Speaking to reporters, President Trump suggested that if the synagogue had had armed protection, “maybe it could have been a very much different situation." Susskind said security can be helpful but isn’t the only way to protect places of worship from harm. "Frankly, if someone is coming in with guns blazing, it’s hard to say whether that would make a difference,” she said. “Synagogues struggle with balancing wanting to be open to the community and protecting congregants. It's a tough, conflicting thing.” Meanwhile, the Interfaith Solidarity Network, a group comprised of L.A.-area faith-based leaders seeking to inspire solidarity and interfaith dialogue – issued a statement Saturday about the shootings. “The ISN condemns the shooting as a xenophobic act of violence stemming from ongoing national divisive rhetoric and policies, and stands in solidarity with the victims of this heinous and racist act,” the organization said. “The ISN also calls on all faith-based leaders across the country to step up efforts toward building bridges of tolerance, peace and unity. The ISN plans to hold an Interfaith Solidarity March on Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. to foster understanding and unity through shared values. The mile-long march will begin at Temple Aliyah, 6025 Valley Circle Boulevard, in Woodland Hills, proceed to Presbyterian Church, 5751 Platt Avenue, and end at Ezzi Masjid Mosque, 5701 Platt Avenue. 12:10 p.m.: This article was updated with new information from local officials. 10:00 a.m.: This article was updated with new information from LAPD.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-sheriff-tattoo-liability-20181027-story.html---split---The image on the deputy’s calf depicted a skeleton in an officer’s uniform, wearing a cowboy hat and clutching a smoking rifle. Jason Zabala said he was inked by an artist who worked at a Sunset Beach tattoo shop and was the 140th person to get the same design. The tattoo, he said, was a proud mark of camaraderie among his fellow peace officers. But years later, a judge would order Zabala and another Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy to answer questions about whether they were members of a clique and allow their tattoos to be photographed as part of a wrongful-death lawsuit. The county paid $1.5 million to settle the case last year. Zabala denied he was part of a clique. The Sheriff’s Department is paying a growing price for its failure to find a solution for an issue that decades of watchdog reports and lawsuits have highlighted as a problem. The tattoos and questions about cliques are being used to challenge deputies’ credibility in court. Officers who are sued over allegations of excessive force have been compelled to answer questions about their ink and allow it to be photographed. “What goes around comes around,” said Merrick Bobb, who was a civilian monitor of the Sheriff’s Department for 22 years. He said the persistence of deputy cliques demonstrates a failure of management. “This is bound to remain an issue as long as the deputies continue to do it,” he said. Few police agencies in the nation have received as much public scrutiny over tattoos and alleged cliques. Similar stories of officer cliques have surfaced in Oakland, New Orleans and the Los Angeles Police Department, but the accounts date back several years and rarely involved exclusive membership. It remains unclear how pervasive the cliques are. Some deputies defend tattoos as fostering morale, arguing that they don’t signify an outlaw culture. Some have also said they have a free-speech right to wear them. The Sheriff’s Department, however, has continued to face fresh allegations of misconduct attributed to branded groups. Just this month, three sheriff’s deputies and a sergeant were placed on leave in connection with an off-duty fight that some deputies say was a dispute over membership in the Banditos, an East Los Angeles deputy club. Watchdog panels in 1992 and 2012 exhorted the Sheriff’s Department to root out gang-like deputy groups. Then-interim Sheriff John Scott said in 2014 he would share the results of an investigation into claims of bullying by the Banditos, yet the probe has remained confidential. In July, Sheriff Jim McDonnell launched what he said would be a comprehensive study of alleged deputy cliques. The inquiry came after The Times revealed that a Compton station deputy involved in a fatal shooting testified that he and as many as 20 of his colleagues have matching skull tattoos. On Thursday, a judge presiding over a wrongful-death lawsuit involving Compton station deputies said the department must reveal whether it’s identified all of the deputies at the station who have the identical tattoos. Members of the department’s civilian oversight commission Thursday also expressed frustration they had received little information about McDonnell’s inquiry. McDonnell said in a statement that his organization has taken “a very strong posture” to hold employees accountable, including recently hiring a second constitutional policing advisor to promote reforms. “We are continuing to assess any potential issues that may arise related to employee conduct, as well as personal and professional choices that impact our organization. We have the same concerns as all of law enforcement, the military, and the private sector about how to balance the constitutional right of free expression with what may, or may not be, an indicator of something more serious,” he said. For years, James Real watched as the lawmen traveled to his Sunset Beach tattoo parlor to be branded with the same design. The Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies would come in groups, sometimes socializing over pizza as they watched one of their own go under the needle, said Real, the owner of American Beauty Tattoo. An artist in his shop etched the matching motifs of a skeleton wearing a cowboy hat, adding a number in sequential order to each one — more than 100 in all. The number on Zabala’s tattoo was 140. The skeleton imprinted on his lower left leg was uniformed with a star-shaped badge, appearing next to a tombstone bearing the logo of the department’s Century station, Zabala said in a 2016 deposition that was reviewed by The Times. Zabala was deposed as part of a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the family of Terry Laffitte, who was shot by deputies in the back of the head and the leg as he lay face down in his backyard in 2013. Prosecutors said Laffitte punched Zabala’s partner and was resisting deputies while holding a revolver when Zabala shot him. The district attorney’s office determined the shooting was lawful. But Laffitte’s family alleged in court documents that Zabala and the other deputy escalated the encounter by violently dragging Laffitte to the ground after pursuing him for riding a bike without a light. The family’s lawyers claimed in their lawsuit that the deputies were part of a clique. Zabala said in depositions he was not part of a department gang. He said the tattoo, with its Old West style, honored the Sheriff’s Department’s founding in 1850, and he claimed that skeletons are “an icon of the peace officer.” “It signifies that all police officers are the same. There’s no race. There’s no gender. There’s no color. There’s no bias. It’s just everyone is the same underneath,” Zabala testified. He said he got the ink two or three months before the shooting of Laffitte. Zabala is now a gang enforcement deputy at the Carson station. He did not respond to requests for comment. It’s far from clear whether deputy tattoos or involvement in cliques have any direct role in the outcome of court cases. A Times review found more than $7 million in county payouts over the last decade in lawsuits claiming excessive force by deputies known to have matching tattoos as well as to settle a case alleging harassment by an inked deputy gang. Of that amount, $5.5 million was paid out in the last two years. Those sums are relatively small compared to the total amount the county spent in Sheriff’s Department litigation payouts over the last 10 years — at least $182 million. Watchdogs say deputies should be more aware of the legal consequences of having matching tattoos. “It makes any lawsuit extremely more complicated and increases potential liability for the county,” said Michael Gennaco, who headed the Office of Independent Review, which monitored the Sheriff’s Department, for 13 years. John Sweeney, the attorney in the wrongful-death lawsuit who elicited the admission by a Compton deputy about his tattoo, said lawyers suing the Sheriff’s Department would be silly not to depose deputies over whether they are inked. “One hundred percent of the time, I ask that question,” Sweeney said. Earlier this year, the county agreed to pay $2.5 million tied to a separate wrongful-death case involving Zabala. He was one of several deputies who fired a total of 34 rounds at Johnny Martinez, a schizophrenic man, in 2014. Prosecutors, who found the shooting was justified, said Martinez had swung a knife at officers. Some deputies have admitted that their tattoos correspond to cliques. Charles McDaniel said under oath in 2013 that his skull ink belonged to the Regulators associated with the Century station, according to a deposition reviewed by The Times. He said the tattoo signified an attachment to “friends, social group, camaraderie,” but he denied knowing about any deputy clubs that honored members who broke people’s bones — an allegation lodged against a group of deputies at Men’s Central Jail. In 2009, McDaniel was a floor sergeant at the county lockup when deputies he supervised were accused of repeatedly beating and shocking an inmate with a stun gun, leaving the man with a fractured leg and extensive injuries. A civil court jury found McDaniel liable for negligence but blamed other deputies for excessive force and battery in the case. The inmate, Tyler Willis, was awarded $290,000 — with $100,000 of the total ordered to be paid out of former Sheriff Lee Baca’s personal funds. McDaniel, now a lieutenant in the department’s custody division, did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyers argued as part of the court proceedings that he did not participate in the use of force and was not implicated in wrongdoing merely by being a supervisor. The only policy in the Sheriff’s Department about tattoos says they should remain covered while deputies are on duty. The department often notes that 1st Amendment concerns may prevent officials from crafting stricter rules barring tattoos. “It seems to me the government would have an uphill battle banning tattoos,” said Eugene Volokh, a 1st Amendment law professor at UCLA. He said California labor law also prohibits employers from interfering with an employee’s political activities, which covers a broad array of behavior that could include being part of a group. Gennaco, the former Sheriff’s Department watchdog, said the county’s lawyers have resisted past efforts to institute more restrictive policies. “It’s very difficult to undo [decades] of culture,” he said. For years, that culture may have been bolstered by the department’s denials about deputy cliques. After the Kolts Commission completed a wide-ranging investigation of the Sheriff’s Department and recommended in 1992 that officials conduct an inquiry and severely punish deputies displaying gang-like behavior, the agency dismissed the idea. “The department is confident there are no racist deputy gangs or cliques within the organization and therefore disagrees that an internal investigation is appropriate,” said Sherman Block, who was then sheriff. The department was more responsive after the Citizens’ Commission on Jail Violence issued findings about widespread mismanagement in the department in 2012. At the recommendation of the panel and other reform efforts, the department began training new deputies about destructive cliques and rotating jail assignments more regularly in order to prevent clubs from forming. Some deputies still quietly complain — as the jail violence commission pointed out — that captains and other department leaders know who the clique members are within the agency and allow them to operate. One deputy, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, said some of “the ink,” as tattooed officers are called, are hard-chargers who drive up the arrest rates at their stations even if it means violating search-and-seizure laws. “They belong to a clique, but yet they’re out there trying to put gangs away off the streets. I just find it a little hypocritical, if you ask me,” the deputy said. Another deputy has openly claimed that the cliques try to enforce unfair rules among their own colleagues. Guadalupe Lopez accused several male officers at the East Los Angeles station of being part of the Banditos, a group that she said wore tattoos of a skeleton in a sombrero and bullied female deputies into submitting to sexual advances. She claimed in a lawsuit in 2014 that after she complained about verbal abuse and hazing by her colleagues, she suffered retaliation including having eggs thrown at her car and finding a rat under it. At least four of the deputies she complained about were suspended for a few days over a range of violations including inappropriate conduct, using derogatory language and hazing. Investigators found that one of the deputies told Lopez, “Girls shouldn’t even be allowed to come into this job force,” and, “We’re going to have to regulate” you, according to an internal affairs report. Another disciplinary letter found that a different deputy told her, “If you don’t submit to the program, you’re going to have a problem.” The reports did not mention findings related to the Banditos or having tattoos. The county paid $1.5 million to settle Lopez’s case last year. She is no longer a deputy. The department has launched administrative investigations into questionable tattoos and cliques whenever the allegations have surfaced, especially if deputies were accused of violating policies, said a statement sent by Capt. Darren Harris of the Sheriff’s Department’s Information Bureau. At American Beauty Tattoo in Sunset Beach, Real said he was stunned by the number of deputies coming in for ink. It wasn’t uncommon for military members to have coordinated tattoos, he said, but Real said he felt that the identical ink on deputies was cause for concern. “It paints a very strong picture of a group of law enforcement agents that are basically unifying themselves in a way that resembles a gang,” he said.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-synagogue-pittsburgh-20181028-story.html---split---They were brothers — Cecil and David Rosenthal. And a married couple — Sylvan and Bernice Simon. The youngest, David Rosenthal, was 54. The oldest, Rose Mallinger, was 97. They were among the 11 victims of a mass shooting in Pittsburgh whose bodies were found across three floors in the Tree of Life Synagogue, where three separate congregations were holding services at the time of Saturday’s attack, federal authorities said Sunday. The county medical examiner described finding ammunition “casings everywhere.” The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was arrested and charged late Saturday on 29 counts, including murder with a firearm, and several hate crime charges such as obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. The murder charges are punishable by death. The other charges are related to injuring officers. Bowers, who was shot and underwent surgery, remained in stable condition and under guard at a hospital, FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Jones told reporters at a news conference Sunday. “This is an awful, awful period for our Jewish community and especially for the families that have been affected,” said Jeffrey Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. “It’s real once you hear the names.” Police say that about 9:50 a.m. Saturday, Bowers opened fire on Sabbath services at the synagogue in Pittsburgh’s historically Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, killing 11 people and wounding six. Four officers were among the injured, and three remain in the hospital. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said Bowers entered three minutes after the service began, killing seven of the 12 people in attendance before moving on to other parts of the building. Myers said he lay in bed Saturday night, staring at the ceiling and wondering, “God, why us?” “My holy place has been defiled,” he said. During the attack and subsequent firefight with officers, Bowers repeatedly stated his desire to kill Jewish people and made comments about genocide, including: “They’re committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews,” according to the Justice Department’s charging document. The Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century, said Sunday that the mass shooting “was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.” Jones said authorities do not yet know why Bowers targeted the Tree of Life Synagogue or where and how Bowers obtained the AR-15 and three Glock .357 handguns used in the attack. Police barricades continued to block the streets surrounding the synagogue Sunday. Law enforcement is checking with neighbors for video surveillance of Bowers and the scene before the attack, Jones said. Officers from multiple cities have traveled to Pittsburgh, Jones said, and law enforcement may need up to a week to fully examine and process the crime scene. “This was a large, complex crime scene, and much work remains to be done,” Jones said. Authorities searched Bowers’ apartment Saturday and his vehicle Sunday, Jones said, but he would not comment on what was found. The apartment is in Baldwin Borough, 12 miles from the synagogue. Bowers is scheduled to appear before a federal judge Monday afternoon. “We will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes,” U.S. Atty. Scott Brady said. Dr. Karl Williams, chief medical examiner for Allegheny County, said three rabbis have worked with his staff to ensure the bodies are handled properly, but he could not say if the examinations would be completed so that they could be released for the timely burial required by Jewish custom. Bowers had a history of posting anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant statements on social media, including one moments before the first 911 calls were made Saturday. His posts specifically mention a Jewish-founded nonprofit that helps resettle refugees from around the world and works with Dor Hadash, one of the three congregations that meet in the synagogue. Dor Hadash member Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was helping set up for the morning’s services when he was killed. Another member, Dan Leger, was wounded. Michael Thompson, 58, of Squirrel Hill is a member of the Dor Hadash congregation. He wasn’t at services Saturday but could hear the commotion from his home down the street. “We just went outside — sirens — and we were trying to figure out what was going on,” he said. “It was crazy, the sirens, and it was still going on.” He paused his recount with a gasp. “The one who is in the hospital is the one who reads the name of the dead,” he said, before apologizing and walking a few feet away. “It’s been a hard couple of days.” President Trump has ordered flags on federal buildings to be flown at half-staff through Wednesday in “solemn respect” for the victims. At a rally Saturday, he condemned the shootings as “pure evil” and questioned how such a thing can happen in 2018. Trump told reporters Saturday that “if there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him.” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the attack “one of the worst moments that we have experienced” and pushed back on the president’s comments that an armed guard would have made a difference. “We’re dealing with irrational behavior; there is no way that you can rationalize a person walking into a synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people,” Peduto said. “We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior. We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior and the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing. “The approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder.” At an interfaith vigil attended by thousands in Pittsburgh on Sunday night, Myers urged American politicians to change their rhetoric. “Ladies and gentlemen, it has to start with you as our leaders,” Myers said to the dozen or so politicians who attended. “My words are not intended as political fodder. If it comes from you, Americans will listen.” At the vigil, city and religious leaders stressed that Pittsburghers would take care of their own. Wasi Mohamed, who leads the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, said his members had already raised $70,000 for the victims’ families and even promised to stand guard outside synagogues if requested. Outside, rain poured over the thousands more sharing umbrellas and straining to hear the sound system. Melissa Casey, 39, of Pittsburgh sat in the rain for two hours, periodically passing her umbrella so parents could shield their small children. “There’s something about being there, being present,” she said through tears. “I want them to know we’re here. This is Pittsburgh.” Authorities released the following names of the shooting victims: — Joyce Fienberg, 75, of the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh — Richard Gottfried, 65, of Ross Township, Pa. — Rose Mallinger, 97, of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh — Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, of Edgewood Borough, Pa. — Cecil Rosenthal, 59, of Squirrel Hill — David Rosenthal, 54, (brother of Cecil), of Squirrel Hill — Bernice Simon, 84, of Wilkinsburg, Pa. — Sylvan Simon, 86, (husband of Bernice), of Wilkinsburg — Daniel Stein, 71, of Squirrel Hill — Melvin Wax, 88, of Squirrel Hill — Irving Younger, 69, of the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh 7:05 p.m.: This article was updated with additional reaction and details, including comments at a vigil. 10:40 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional details of the investigation.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-synagogue-shooting-security-20181028-story.html#nt=related-content---split---To get into Temple Isaiah in Los Angeles, visitors must find their way around a brick wall that separates the synagogue from the street, get buzzed through a gate, and avoid setting off suspicion among guards who protect the facility with guns. In the aftermath of Saturday’s deadly anti-Semitic shooting in Pittsburgh, Jewish congregations around the country are increasing security. But at Temple Isaiah, a Reform Judaism congregation on the city’s Westside that counts 900 families as members, the guards have been armed and ready for violence for nearly a year. “None of us want this,” said Rabbi Dara Frimmer. “But we’re just living in a different era.” Jewish communities are confronting a renewed question: In a time of anti-Semitism and mass shootings, how does a house of worship balance safety and sacredness? How open or closed should a synagogue be? U.S. Jewish communities have long suffered threats and watched for potential violence, with big-city Jewish centers employing elaborate security measures after decades of vandalism, bomb threats and other attacks. But the shootings at the Tree of Life congregation, which killed 11 and injured six, have put Jewish temples, schools, community centers and federations on alert like rarely before. They’ve also inspired some temples that have resisted the highest security measures to consider them. “I’ve been getting calls all day,” said Frimmer, who said congregants have asked “how to go about living as a Jewish person in America.” Her temple armed its guards after concerns rose over school shootings and a rash of bomb threats against U.S. Jewish centers last year. The liberal congregation, which runs outreach efforts to LGBTQ, Muslim and refugee communities, saw a need to defend itself after realizing it was increasingly attractive to extremists not only because of its faith but because of its programming.  “We can be targeted because we are Jewish and because we represent the part of the America that the extremists hate,” said Frimmer.  Although her synagogue uses guns for protection, security standards around the country vary widely. Many synagogues employ armed guards, metal detectors and other measures to protect congregants, and have increasingly become more protected amid threats of violence in recent years. Nearly all synagogues have police on hand for major holidays such as Rosh Hashanah. Others have unarmed guards other times of the year or, especially in smaller cities, volunteer security or no security at all.  Tree of Life, a Conservative congregation in Pittsburgh’s historically Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, typically had guards for holidays but otherwise was unprotected, according to members who have spoken publicly since Saturday.  “This has resonated in a way that is more chilling than before,” said David Friedman, the Anti-Defamation League's vice president for law enforcement and community security.  Friedman, who advises synagogues nationally on security, said he’s seen a “higher number than ever before” of Jewish communities seeking help to beef up security after the shooting. Another Jewish group that has trained thousands of volunteers protect synagogues, Community Security Service, said it’s been inundated with requests for new training over the weekend.  Even in places where security is already high, Jewish communities have debated whether there should be more.  “I’ve received numerous emails from congregants who think our security needs to be reexamined,” said Rabbi Beth Singer of Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, where visitors have for years needed to pass through metal detectors and are watched by guards.  “It strikes me because we are right next to a beautiful [Presbyterian] church that keeps its doors open all day. But we have to keep ourselves locked up,” said Singer, whose congregation includes 2,100 member families. “We worry about the unfounded hatred of Jews and we also worry about the prevalence of heavy-duty arms that are so easily attained today.”  Security at U.S. synagogues has increased in waves, mostly in reaction to attacks and threats. After a white supremacist fired shots into the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills in August 1999, injuring five, Jewish centers around the country implemented new protective measures. That increased further after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. When tensions have flared between Israelis and Palestinians, synagogues have typically upped security in response to potential threats. Many temples have also increased protection in the last two years amid historically high numbers of anti-Semitic incidents.  Anti-Semitic harassment, threats and vandalism throughout the U.S. jumped 57% last year over the previous year, according to an annual report from the Anti-Defamation League. In 2017, the group counted 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. — the second-highest number since the group began tracking them nearly four decades ago.  At Temple Emanu-El of Utica in Upstate New York, Rabbi Peter Schaktman said the Pittsburgh shooting will probably prompt his small congregation — where there are no guards and doors are typically left open for events — to consider whether to formalize security procedures.  “We don’t have a clear policy,” Schaktman said. “It’s intuitive. If there are a lot of kids around for an event, the door is locked. If it’s a funeral, the door is unlocked.”  “This shooting will enhance fear and awareness,” he said. “We don’t want people to be so fearful that they won’t come out and participate in Jewish life. But we also want people to feel and be safe. That balance is a challenge.”  It’s a balance that has largely gone to the wayside in some parts of the world, said Paul Goldenberg, a fellow at the Rutgers University Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience.  “You cannot enter a synagogue in Europe right now in Belgium or in France or in Germany without having to pass barbed wire and military-like troops,” said Goldenberg, the former director of the Secure Communities Network, a national effort that launched in 2004 in partnership with the Jewish Federations of North America to make Jewish centers safer. In Europe, measures have increased in recent years amid threats by right-wing nationalist groups and anti-Semitic attacks that have hit Jewish communities in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  Goldenberg cautioned that too much security could be harmful to religious institutions.  “What we don’t want to happen is that our religious institutions here become places where you can’t gain entry and where they are not welcoming,” he said. “If that happens, everything will change.”

TOP STORIES Hate Speech and Hate Crime As the stories of the 11 shooting victims at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday emerge, authorities have charged a 46-year-old man on 29 counts in what the Anti-Defamation League has called “the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.” Coming after the arrest of a 56-year-old vocal supporter of President Trump who was charged with sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats last week, the attack has raised more questions about rhetoric, social media and responsibility. Both men posted their views online before allegedly acting out; the Pittsburgh suspect wrote on Gab, a platform that’s been a safe harbor for white nationalists, moments before the first 911 calls came. Meanwhile, Trump has come under criticism for sending mixed messages — condemning the attacks while also continuing to vilify his political opponents and the media. Brazil Takes a Far-Right Turn He has a history of making outrageous statements, insulting women and minorities and defending the use of torture. Now, Jair Bolsonaro will be the next president of Brazil after winning 55% of the vote on Sunday. Many voters said they were drawn to Bolsonaro’s strong style, particularly his vows to be tough on crime and make it easier for Brazilians to carry firearms. He’s also threatened to expel or even exterminate his political opponents. An MIA Back Home in Indiana Master Sgt. Charles McDaniel Sr. served as a medic during the Korean War. He disappeared in November 1950. Though the Army presumed he was dead, there was never a funeral — until this weekend, when his family buried McDaniel’s remains in Indiana. North Korea recently turned them over as part of an agreement between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Trump. After 68 years, McDaniel’s family has found some peace. When ‘None of the Above’ Isn’t an Option For those of you who believe that elections come down to choosing the lesser of two evils: Congratulations! You could hold the decisive votes in next week’s midterm. The latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll shows that voters who don’t like either party or its leaders are leaning toward Democrats.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-chicago-police-20170521-story.html#nt=barker&bn=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It---split---Chicago police officials have announced policy changes intended to cut back on questionable shootings and other uses of force that have haunted the department for years. The changes, made after months of revisions, will tighten Police Department rules that experts and advocates have criticized as too permissive of unnecessary uses of force. The policy changes — expected to take effect this fall — represent a milestone for a department upended nearly 18 months ago by the release of video of a white officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. The revised rules, however, do not go as far in some respects as the rules proposed by Police Supt. Eddie Johnson in October, when the department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel faced more intense federal scrutiny amid the immediate fallout over the video. The final version of the department's main use-of-force policy substantially resembles the scaled-back proposal Johnson made in March after rank-and-file police complained that his first proposal was too extreme. In one key change, the policy holds that an officer can't shoot a fleeing suspect unless that person presents an imminent threat to police or others. The rule that has been in place says an officer can shoot any person fleeing after committing or trying to commit a felony using force. The new policy also calls on officers to use their new deescalation training to try to defuse incidents. But the adopted language is less strict than what Johnson first proposed. Officers have to try deescalation only "when it is safe and feasible to do so." Johnson announced the new rules Wednesday at an event at police headquarters designed to show unity among his command staff, rank-and-file officers and residents. Johnson was also joined by activist William Calloway, who helped force the release of the McDonald video. On stage during questioning by the media, Calloway greeted Johnson with a handshake and said, "What's up, Supe?" He credited the protests over the McDonald shooting with creating change in the department. "This is a big win for us, that our voices were heard," Calloway said. But he added the caution that it won't be clear how effective the rules are until they are in place. The policies are yet another point of disagreement between top department officials and the Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents rank-and-file officers and whose contract with the city expires this year. Kevin Graham, elected union president last month, released a statement decrying the "anti-law enforcement climate" in Chicago. Graham has opposed the idea that the department needs outside oversight or tougher discipline. "Three Chicago police officers have been shot in the last two weeks. The reality is that many offenders do not want to go to jail and they become resistant or combative with officers. These violators determine the level of response by officers," Graham said. "For these reasons, we do not believe that extensive changes should be made to the current use of force policy. Nevertheless, we are always willing to discuss new measures with the superintendent that [ensure] the safety of our officers and [that] of the public," the statement read. In a break from tradition for a department that has done little to train officers on policy changes, all of the approximately 12,000 officers will receive both computerized and in-person training on the new use-of-force rules, Johnson announced. Officer discipline has been rare and often light in Chicago, and oversight officials aiming to strengthen accountability have sought changes to use-of-force policies widely criticized as too permissive. More specific rules could give disciplinary authorities stricter standards to apply to officers who use force in questionable circumstances. The department's force policies drew intense focus after Emanuel was forced in November 2015 to release video from the year before of Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police with a knife in his hand. Furious protests followed, and the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the department. Emanuel, meanwhile, made changes aimed at getting ahead of federal authorities. One of his early moves was to propose new rules on the use of force. Hinkle writes for the Chicago Tribune.

The 20-year-old was withdrawing from his siblings and cousins, whom he had long considered his closest friends. He would laugh out loud for no apparent reason. He told doctors in Tulsa, Okla., that something was "taking over" his brain. One day last year, Colbert abruptly boarded a Greyhound bus to Southern California. Days later, police say, he walked up to a woman and her 4-year-old daughter as they were returning home from buying groceries and fatally shot them. The killing of Carina Mancera and her daughter, Jennabel, stunned the downtown Long Beach community and baffled investigators for months. Colbert was eventually linked to the crime through DNA. But authorities have not identified a motive for the slayings or said whether he knew the victims. Prosecutors describe the attack as an ambush, alleging Colbert hid before shooting the mother and daughter. Whatever the motive, Colbert had been struggling with mental illness for some time, isolating himself from his loved ones and using a dangerous synthetic drug in the years before the shootings, according to a review of medical records and court documents and interviews with Colbert's relatives. Despite this history, Colbert, now 23, is acting as his own attorney in a case in which prosecutors could seek the death penalty. During recent court hearings, he has denied involvement in the shootings and raised bizarre conspiracy theories in his defense. At one point, he claimed the victims he is accused of killing are still alive. He has not raised insanity as a possible defense. Colbert's relatives and several defense lawyers have said he is incapable of representing himself. On Monday, a judge is expected to decide whether Colbert is mentally competent to stand trial. The description of Colbert stalking a Long Beach street with a shotgun makes little sense to Yolanda Colbert. Her son was never violent or troubled, she said, but a 2014 diagnosis of mental illness was part of a downward spiral, one that may have sparked his move to California and turned him into a man she barely recognizes now. "He was just talking out of his head.… We're a very close family and he just kept saying that things were out to get him and the CIA was after him and stuff like that," she said. "He wasn't himself." Growing up in Tulsa, Colbert was a bit of a loner, with simple pleasures and simple aims, relatives said. He made good grades in high school, and he was on the football and wrestling teams. Far from a social butterfly, Colbert focused on family, spending most weekends with his siblings and cousins, playing video games or hanging around the house, said his younger sister, Breyan. Colbert hoped to become a dentist, and he started working as a dental assistant after high school. He was fired in 2013 after failing a drug test for using marijuana, his mother said. "I think that kind of broke his spirit right there," Yolanda Colbert said. Months later, Colbert grew withdrawn and paranoid, expressing concern that something was "taking over" his brain, according to his family and medical records reviewed by The Times. In October 2014, he spent two weeks at a mental health facility in Tulsa, where he was diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, meaning he was presenting symptoms of schizophrenia but not for the six-month period necessary for a formal diagnosis, records show. He admitted to near daily use of marijuana and some use of "K2," also known as "spice," a synthetic form of marijuana that can lead to psychotic episodes and violent outbursts. The drug can also exacerbate underlying symptoms of mental illness, said Michael Levine, the chief of the division of medical toxicology at USC. It is unclear how often Colbert was using spice, but doctors in Oklahoma feared he had downplayed how frequently he was smoking it, records show. Colbert was released after 13 days at the facility, and doctors said he was not having suicidal or homicidal thoughts at the time, according to a medical report. Medication prescribed to Colbert kept the symptoms at bay for a while, though his sister said he struggled to accept his diagnosis. He did not like taking the medication, and was unable to find a new job, relatives said. Colbert stopped taking the medication early in 2016, his mother said. The symptoms soon returned. Yolanda Colbert said she sought a court order to have her son resume treatment. Colbert was not found to be a danger to himself and was allowed to remain out of treatment, she said, and the decision to try to force him into a mental health facility opened up a rift between mother and son. "He was mad at me so he wasn't talking to me," she said. "He was basically isolating himself. Just distancing himself from his family." Colbert boarded a California-bound bus in Tulsa on Aug. 3, 2016, and arrived in Los Angeles the next day, police said. His mother assumed her son was traveling west to look for work. Breyan said her brother had always wanted to go to California, but didn't give a reason for this specific trip. He didn't know anyone in the state, she said. On Aug. 6, Carina Mancera, 26, was returning to her Long Beach home just north of downtown after a trip to the grocery store with her 4-year-old daughter, Jennabel Anaya, and her longtime boyfriend, Luis Anaya. As they walked from their car, a man wearing "all black" stepped out from behind a concrete sign and opened fire, according to testimony Anaya gave at a March hearing in Colbert's case. As his girlfriend and daughter fell to the street, Anaya said, he briefly locked eyes with the gunman. "When I tried to look at him, he shot at me," a tearful Anaya told reporters the morning after the killings. The final shot missed, and the gunman fled, Anaya said. Seconds later, Anaya raced toward his girlfriend and their daughter, stumbling into a horrific scene. Mancera died almost instantly, court records show. Jennabel lay near her mother, bleeding and screaming. One of the girl's arms had been "blown off," Anaya testified. He put the child on the phone with her grandmother, desperate to comfort her, but Jennabel died a short time later at a hospital. The shooting left investigators and those close to the victims scratching their heads. Anaya and Mancera had been dating for five years and were well-liked in the neighborhood, friends said. Police dismissed any suggestion that the attack was linked to drug or gang activity. A Long Beach homicide sergeant described the case as a "whodunit." Two months later, police released surveillance video of a man lurking in the area and riding a Blue Line train with luggage on the night of the shooting. They described him as a "person of interest," but didn't know who he was or whether he was still in California. In some of the videos, a long narrow object could be seen protruding from the man's bags. Investigators now believe it was the nose of the murder weapon: a shotgun. By this point, Colbert was in county jail. Los Angeles police had arrested him on suspicion of car theft on Aug. 27, though those charges were later dropped, court records show. Yolanda Colbert said she traveled to Los Angeles to visit her son after he was arrested, and found he had been placed on suicide watch. "I don't want you to see him like this," a public defender told her. The defense lawyer raised doubts as to Colbert's mental health in the car theft case, but he was found competent to stand trial in November, records show. Days later, he was charged with two counts of murder in the Long Beach shootings. DNA found on a shotgun shell at the crime scene linked Colbert to the killings, according to court records. I don’t believe these people are actually dead because I said this is like a Hollywood movie and I’m not an actor and I don’t want to play this game.” As his case moves toward trial, Colbert's mental health has become a central issue. A lawyer hired by his family pleaded with the court to block Colbert from acting as his own attorney. Last month, prosecutors filed a motion asking a judge to determine whether or not Colbert is capable of representing himself. In the motion, prosecutors referred to Colbert as a "gray-area defendant," who might be competent to stand trial, but not capable of legally defending himself. A judge in April ordered Colbert to undergo a mental health evaluation. In recent months, Colbert has appeared confused and unnerved during a series of pre-trial hearings. At several points, he has asked judges for advice on how to proceed, over admonishments that the court cannot aid in his defense. During his preliminary hearing in March, Colbert did not call any witnesses, and entered only one item into evidence: the bus ticket proving he traveled from Oklahoma to California days before the shooting. He also countered the prosecution's claim that he brought the murder weapon from Oklahoma, claiming he pawned a shotgun back home to obtain bus fare to California. Mostly, he has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Colbert has repeatedly insisted he is being framed. He has made several references to the 1997 crime drama "Gang Related." The movie, starring James Belushi and Tupac Shakur, centers on a pair of corrupt police officers who frame a homeless man for the murder of an undercover federal agent. During the March hearing, Colbert made his boldest and strangest claim: that the mother and daughter he is accused of killing are still alive. "I don't believe these people are actually dead because I said this is like a Hollywood movie and I'm not an actor and I don't want to play this game," he said, according to a transcript of the hearing. Jim Preis, an attorney specializing in mental health law who now serves as executive director at Mental Health Advocacy Services in Los Angeles, said Colbert's prior diagnosis would not automatically preclude him from being found competent to stand trial. A defendant's ability to stand trial can change over time, he said. A judge would need to determine that Colbert understands what is going on in the courtroom and is capable of assisting in his own defense in order to determine he is fit to stand trial. If Colbert is allowed to stand trial, that does not necessarily mean he is competent to represent himself, Preis said. A separate hearing could be ordered to determine if Colbert can act as his own attorney, Preis said, adding that a judge would need to believe Colbert is capable of "organizing and presenting his own defense." In March, Colbert filed a rambling, handwritten note asking for the case to be dismissed. "I have substantial evidence of a theory of a setup, of staged circumstances," he wrote. The note provided no further explanation. james.queally@latimes.com Follow @JamesQueallyLAT for crime and police news in California.

(Ralf Hirschberger/AFP/Getty Images) The decade after Germany's reunification in 1990 saw a flurry of meditations on the future of German right-wing politics. There were good reasons for concern. The 1990s were a disorienting time; the familiar Cold War order had broken down, and a new and uncertain millennium was dawning. The decade also witnessed the move of the nation's capital from...

With oil prices low, state oil companies were struggling, and market-friendly governments had started opening their energy industries to private investment. In the coming months, though, the region's two largest economies may both ...

Between 1978 and 2013, the Chinese economy grew by an average rate of 10 percent a year, producing a tenfold increase in average adult income.

By Elizabeth Miles, Robbie Gramer Nearly two years into the Trump administration, over two dozen ambassador posts remain unfilled and without a nominee—including the ambassador positions in both Turkey and Saudi Arabia. That staffing gap issue resurfaced in the past week when Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi—who is also a US resident—went missing in Turkey amid reports that he was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Though the US embassies in both countries have diplomatic staff, the absence of an ambassador has implications on the work diplomats do and could send a message tha...

The document claims to mark “a shift in America's approach to countering and preventing terrorism.” In reality, it exhibits considerable continuity with the Obama administration's approach, which in turn built on adaptions President George W.

But making your 5-year-old son wear one too is an even worse idea. Owensboro, KY, resident Bryant Goldbach has apologized for offending people by dressing as a Nazi, and dressing his son as Adolf Hitler, for a Thursday evening Halloween event. He said he did it because they “love history and often dress the part of historical figures,” the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.

Sayoc’s mother, Madeline Giardiello, kicked him out of th...

Bolsonaro easily defeated the uninspiring Workers’ Party candidate Fernando Haddad in the Sunday electoral runoff by a tally of 55.5% to 44.5%, with 94% of the vote tallied. The Guardian described Bolsonaro, 63, as a “far-right, pro-gun, pro-torture populist.” He’s also homophobic and racist.

Just a day after anti-Semitic terrorist Robert Bowers killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and two days after Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested for sending pipe bombs to Trump critics, the president is continuing his common tactic of publicly attacking victims.

That’s what happens when a wannabe-despot radicalizes his base, two of which committed horrendous acts of domestic terrorism this week. Trump doesn’t appear to be handling it very well. First, he tried to call for national unity after one of his rabid supporters, Cesar Sayoc Jr., was arrested for sending over a dozen pipe bombs by mail to prominent Democrats, Trump critics, and intelligence analysts. “America...

That’s it. It’s not “extremes on both sides.” It’s not “a breakdown in civility.” It’s not “divisive identity politics.” It’s that the conservative movement in America is fueling a rise in fascist hatred throughout the country—the kind that drove a Nazi to enter a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday morning and murder 11 people while reportedly screaming “All Jews must die,” or that pushed a white supremac...

The gunman also shot at least three armed police officers, but Trump did not appear to account for that in his remarks.

He does, however, feel fine talking about “globalists.” Before a planned speech at the Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House, Trump gave his first public remarks following the arrest of Cesar Sayoc in connection with a string of bombing attempts aimed at prominent Democrats and media figures at CNN.

This is not going to happen, obviously. Farrow is not some magical avatar of justice who can be deployed by anyone at any time, and NBC is surely not in the business of letting random people attend highly sensitive contractual negotiations.

---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-synagogue-needed-armed-guard-stop-arming-society/story?id=58803241---split---On the day after a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, city officials responded to President Donald Trump's suggesting that the house of worship should have had armed guards. Pittsburgh City Council member Erica Strassburger told ABC News "This Week" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz that although an armed guard "could have saved lives" at the synagogue, putting guns in the hands of more people isn't the answer to violence in the U.S. "If you think about it ... yesterday it was at a synagogue, it might be at a school, but the next time it could be at a grocery store or at a public market," said Strassburger, who represents the neighborhood where the shooting occurred. "Where do we stop with arming our entire society and feeling as if we can’t be safe anywhere? I just don’t see that as the answer." City Council member Corey O’Connor, who also represents the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the massacre happened, agreed that having armed guards at every venue isn’t a solution. “That’s not the community we want," O'Connor told Raddatz. "We don’t want people having armed guards at every door you walk into.”   Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also responded to the president's remark about the need for armed guards, saying at a press conference Sunday that what's needed instead is to make sure people "looking to express hatred through murder" don't have access to guns.   "We're dealing with an irrational behavior," Peduto said at the news conference. "We shouldn’t be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that occur from irrational behavior. We should be working to eliminate irrational behavior in the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing." The mayor continued, "I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder."   President Trump on Saturday strongly condemned the shooting in Pittsburgh as "evil." Early in the day, just a few hours after the shooting, the president said, "It’s presumed that this is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately ... Maybe nobody would have been killed except for him. So it’s a very, very difficult situation." When a reporter asked if all synagogues and churches should have armed guards, Trump said, "I hate to think of it that way ... It’s certainly an option." The president has also in the past called for arming teachers as a way to prevent school shootings. After a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in February killed 17, Trump told a conservative conference, "When we declare our schools gun-free zones it just puts our students in far more danger."     Arming staff at the school would be "a major deterrent," he said. The massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday killed 11 people and injured at least six more, including four police officers who responded to the gunfire. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, who has been arrested and charged, had allegedly posted anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant messages on social media, including one post that said, “Jews are the children of Satan.”

After Saturday's mass shooting, Pittsburghers are turning to one of the city's best unifiers to help the community recover: black and gold. Thousands crowded into Soldiers & Sailors auditorium hall, pouring into the streets and huddled together in the rain for a candlelight vigil. The teary-eyed crowd spoke of resilience, healing, and gun control the day after a mass shooting claimed the lives of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue. The man accused of storming a Pittsburgh synagogue and killing 11 worshippers during an anti-Semitic rampage was described Sunday by neighbors as a loner who listened to talk radio, chain-smoked and was so bland in person that he bordered on being “forgettable.” After Saturday's mass shooting, Pittsburghers are turning to one of the city's best unifiers to help the community recover: Black and gold. The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. points the finger at social media for the increase in hate and calls on politicians from both sides of the aisle to stand together against it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a tribute to the Jewish community of Pittsburgh following Saturday’s mass murder at a Pennsylvania synagogue, allegedly by a gunman who expressed hatred of Jews as he opened fire with an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and later told police, “All these Jews need to die.” The suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue repeatedly expressed anti-Semitic views as he traded gunfire with responding officers, at one point flatly stating: "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit made public Sunday.

I always figured that it would happen when she was in kindergarten, maybe first grade if we were “lucky.” I remember becoming aware of racism in kindergarten myself when I saw the Klan on a talk show. In fact, the n-word was one of the first words I learned how to read. The first time someone called me the n-word was in first grade. Even after having those experiences, I didn’t think I would have to address racial insensitivity with my child’s teacher and school administrators whi... In a rare and remarkable admission of failure, the head of the New York Police Department issued a “long overdue” public apology to a rape survivor whose 1994 complaint was met with skepticism by investigators. “We were wrong then,” police Commissioner James O’Neill said in a statement on the police department website on Sunday. “I want us to be right today.” I sincerely hope everyone has a chance to read my full apology to the brave survivor of the 1994 Prospect Park rape case. It is long overdue, and I issue it on behalf of every member of the New York City Police Department, past and pre... I understand what Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf was trying to do with his statement immediately following Saturday’s mass murder at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. When he said, “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans,” he was saying that this horrific event ― a hate-fueled massacre of innocents in an American house of worship ― does not reflect our national character. And I get it. It’s gut-churning to think what happened there is a reflection of all of us, as opposed to the work of a lone, depraved actor. But here’s the problem: It is who we are. Or, at least,... Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been one of the NBA’s go-to guys for speaking out on the issues. After a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle and handguns killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in PIttsburgh, the coach wasn’t about to go silent. He told reporters before Sunday’s Warriors-Nets game in Brooklyn that more athletes and coaches are voicing their opinions “because the times call for it.

Gab.com, the self-described “free speech social media platform” popular with alt-right activists and white nationalists, has gone offline after facing widespread backlash in the aftermath of Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Several companies that had provided Gab with crucial services to keep the site running ― including its domain provider ― have cut ties with the platform, forcing it to go temporarily offline. Gab, however, has vowed to get the site back up and running as soon as possible. The suspected gunman in the synagogue attack, Robert Bowers, had posted brazenly ... Vice President Mike Pence defended President Donald Trump on Saturday amid criticism that the divisive rhetoric pouring from the White House had influenced the mass pipe bomb mailings sent to prominent Democrats or the attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh last week. “Everyone has their own style, and frankly, people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences,” Pence said on NBC News Saturday. “But I just don’t think you can connect it to acts or threats of violence.” The U.S. is reeling from a shocking week of threats and attacks after Cesar Sayoc, 56, was... The results of the 2016 election felt like a punch to the gut. I remember feeling stunned, confused, and unprepared for what lay ahead. I learned in that moment, and in many moments since, that elections have consequences. We enter the Nov. 6 midterm election ruled by a Republican majority carrying out a concerted voter suppression campaign and with a leader blatantly cultivating an environment of racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia and oppression. This must end. In the two years since the presidential election, many of us have committed to fight this systemic oppre... Liberal lawyers are reassessing their Supreme Court strategies now that they face not only a solidly conservative majority but the addition of a justice who has openly expressed animosity toward them. When Brett Kavanaugh angrily testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to sexual assault and misconduct allegations, he accused “the Clintons” and “left-wing opposition groups” of orchestrating a smear campaign against him. And he warned in a very unjudicial statement, “What goes around comes around.” “The really scary thing for us right now is there are all these cases teed ...

What is it about grilled cheese that brings back so many childhood memories? The mere utterance of the word and I can see my mom liberally buttering two sides of white bread, adding a slice of American cheese and frying it up until it reached a flawless golden brown consistency. Grilled cheese was a staple in our house. We had it for weeknight dinners, on cold snowy days or even during a snack on summer vacation.

Let’s be real: If you aren’t on dating apps, you’re going to have a very hard time finding someone to love (or hook up with). Unfortunately, the apps aren’t the most welcoming place for trans men and women. Mainstream apps like Tinder, Grindr and OkCupid have been slow to recognize the needs of their trans users. It wasn’t until 2016 that Tinder made it possible for users to specify gender identities like “transgender,” “tran... John Oliver called out Fox News for promoting conspiracy theories about the bomb scare targeting prominent Democratic leaders, including former President Barack Obama as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. “At the risk of sounding like a far right-wing lunatic, I have to say that I believe that this whole thing was an elaborate hoax,” the network’s Geraldo Rivera said at one point. Rivera used the wrong choice of words, Oliver said. “Sounding like a far-right-wing lunatic is not really a risk for the Fox News brand, is it?

Goldbach initially tried to defend his choice, writing that “anyone who knows us knows that we love our history, and often dress the part of historical figures. While Goldbach dressed as a Confederate soldier for Halloween last year, he d... Donald Trump had another awkward encounter with an umbrella over the weekend. The president was carrying his own umbrella as he boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on his way to a campaign rally in Indianapolis on Saturday. When Trump reached the doorway, he dumped the open umbrella at the threshold.

Trump has been accused of being an umbrella hog on more than one occasion, specifically for holding one over his own head but not cover... The Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower turned out the lights on Sunday night in honor of the 11 people killed in an anti-Semitic shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz once helped a man get through the “most terrifying and frightening time” of his life. Now the good doctor is gone. Rabinowitz was among the 11 people who were shot and killed when suspected gunman Robert Bowers opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday. Witnesses said Rabinowitz was shot as he rushed to help others amid the melee. He was in the basement with a separate congregation and raced to the scene of the shooting to offer any aid he could, reported Haaretz. “That was Uncle Jerry; that’s just what he did,” a nephew posted on Facebook. Rabinowitz had “a... The leaders of a progressive Jewish organization in Pittsburgh said President Donald Trump should not visit the city as it mourns the 11 people murdered in a mass shooting at a synagogue until he changes his tone. “President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,” the leaders of the local chapter of Bend the Arc wrote, adding: “For the past three years, your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement. You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.” Th... A Campbell Soup executive was quickly shown the door after spreading a right-wing conspiracy theory that liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros is bankrolling a caravan of immigrants heading to the U.S. border. Campbell vice president of government affairs Kelly Johnston, a former secretary of the U.S. Senate, tweeted Monday that Soros’ Open Society Foundation was providing aid to the caravan. There’s no evidence for a such a statement. Johnston claimed that Soros’ organization was the puppet master behind “troop carriers” and “rail cars” moving the migrants. Johnston’s account is ... We get it. Things aren’t looking great for Rick Grimes. The last we saw him, Andrew Lincoln’s character was riding around on his white horse, a la Khaleesi, trying to lead the zombie herds away from the super sick camp they’ve all built, where everyone happily gets along during the times when there’s not a mutiny. But Rick’s horse got spooked when another large zombie herd showed up, throwing him off so violently he gets impaled by some metal sticking out of concrete rubble. Rick passed out as the two large herds closed in. It wasn’t ideal. It sure seemed like a cliffhanger. We’re heading i... Filmmaker Michael Moore posted a video clip of suspected pipe bomber Cesar Sayoc at a rally for President Donald Trump last year, apparently chanting “CNN sucks” with a group of Trump supporters. The clip is an outtake from Moore’s current movie “Fahrenheit 11/9.” It was filmed in Melbourne, Florida, at the first Trump 2020 re-election rally, which was held just a month after Trump’s inauguration in 2017. Moore said his instructions for the scene were not to film Trump at the rally, but only the people in the crowd. “My feeling was, after one month in office, we didn’t need to hear anythin...

There are picket fences, cinder-block fences and fences with metal railings capped with three-point tips. One of the grandest houses in the neighborhood where Diaz’s canvassers are knocking on doors has a fence with brick pilings and white stiles. It’s lined with statues of lions. And behind the fences, there’s usually at least one dog. “They make it hard to get to the door,” Diaz said. “You gotta look for that one person who know... After a series of corruption scandals rocked South Dakota between 2014 and 2016, residents of the state overwhelmingly backed a ballot initiative that submitted politicians to new ethics laws, curtailed the number of gifts lobbyists could hand lawmakers and created a public financing system for state elections.

The state’s Nov. 6 ballot features a constitutional amendment, Amendment W., that would enact stri... The rise of right-wing movements and parties across the globe took a giant and dangerous leap forward Sunday when far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s presidential election. Bolsonaro, a federal congressman for Rio de Janeiro who formerly served as an Army officer, has praised the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 and has expressed a fondness for authoritarians past and present. He defeated former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers’ Party to win the runoff phase of the election. With nearly all votes counted, Bolsonaro had captured mo... The pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine worshippers were gunned down in 2015, condemned President Donald Trump’s response to the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday. “Words do matter,” the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning told his congregants during an emotional sermon on Sunday. “The words that come out of your mouth can do much harm or much good. The choice is indeed yours.” Manning criticized Trump for claiming “armed guards” likely could have prevented a gunman’s attack on the Tree of Life Congregation, which left at least...

The rabbi who led the memorial service for the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre called for political leaders to “stop the words of hate” as chants of “vote, vote” broke out from the crowd. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers told the crowd gathered at the University of Pittsburgh’s Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall to pay tribute to the 11 people who were killed in the mass shooting that “words of hate are unwelcome in Pittsburgh. It starts with the people in this room.” “Ladies and gentlemen, it has to start with you as our leaders” Myers said to loud applause, prompting the chants of “vote, vo... Israel’s Chief Rabbi has been criticized for not describing the site of the massacre of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh as a synagogue. Rabbi David Lau, along with ultra-Orthodox Israeli newspapers, refrained from describing the Tree of Life temple, where a gunman carried out what is believed to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in American history on Saturday, as a synagogue. The Tree of Life synagogue has a Conservative congregation and the ultra-Orthodox community does not recognize non-Orthodox movements of Judaism. The Times of Israel described ultra-Orthodox Lau as an "avowed foe" of more libera... Meet the Press has sparked outrage for inviting Erick Erickson on the show to discuss conspiracy theories in the wake of a spate of attempted mail bombings, after the controversial conservative commentator previously spread misinformation on topics including the migrant caravan. Chuck Todd, host of the NBC show, asked the founder of the conservative website The Resurgent who is responsible for providing Americans with facts. “Erick, I’m curious.

Former U.S. democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has denied she intends to run again in 2020, but conceded that she still wants to sit in the White House. The veteran politician, who lost the race to Donald Trump in 2016, told journalist Kara Swisher during a podcast taping last Friday that the current administration had “confused” the world, and indicated she believed her lengthy tenure in government left her better suited to the role.

A 26-year-old Honduran man who had been traveling to the U.S. border with a caravan of Central American asylum seekers died on Sunday after the group clashed with Guatemalan and Mexican police on a border bridge between the two countries. The group of predominantly Honduran migrants had been trying to pass through Guatemalan border town Tecun Uman to Ciudad Hidalgo in Mexico, but they were blocked by authorities, who locked metal gates separating the two countries, the Associated Press reported. Migrants broke through the barriers, however, leading to a clash with police that reportedly lef... A Pittsburgh Jewish group has lambasted President Donald Trump and said his is “not welcome” in the city over his failure to “fully denounce white nationalism.” On Saturday, a gunman killed 11 people in a mass shooting at the city’s Tree of Life synagogue. The suspected attacker—46-year-old Robert Bowers—was a known anti-Semite who had written numerous anti-Jewish messages online.

Documentary film maker Michael Moore has shared an outtake from his latest movie Fahrenheit 11/9 of suspected pipe bomber Cesar Sayoc attending a Donald Trump rally last year. The footage shows Sayoc, 56, joining in with chants of “CNN Sucks” and “tell the truth” at a “Trump 2020 Re-election Rally” in Melborne, Florida, in February 2017, just one month after he was inaugurated as president. Sayoc is also seen holding a placard reading “Boycott—Banded—Blocked, Fake news and dishonest media CNN sucks."

Gab was the social media platform of choice for a wide range of anti-Semitic commentary from Robert Bowers, 46, the suspect in Saturday morning's Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead in Pittsburgh. Screenshots of Gab comments from Bowers' @onedingo account railed against a Jewish "infestation" and called upon #QAnon for assistance in "draining the swamp," a common Trump rallying cry.

The chief executive and director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Jonathan Greenblatt, warned on Sunday that anti-semitism is “becoming normalized” in the current political environment, also calling out the divisive rhetoric of President Donald Trump. "We are seeing an environment in which anti-Semitism has moved from the margins to the mainstream as political candidates and people in public life literally repeat the rhetoric of white supremacists,” Greenblatt, who previously served in the White House as a special assistant to former President Barack Obama, told NBC's "Meet the Press" o... President Donald Trump ignored calls this weekend to measure his hatred for a series of opponents who were targeted by one of his supporters in a campaign of pipe bombs. On Sunday, he ridiculed billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer, one of 12 intended targets of the mailed pipe bombs. All of the intended targets, which included the Clintons, the Obamas, current Democratic lawmakers and former intelligence agency officials, among others, were either prominent Democrats or critics of the president. CNN's New York offices were also targeted. “Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not see... A North Carolina woman who repeatedly told two black sisters "I'm beautiful, I'm white" in a video that went viral this weekend has lost her job, the company she worked for said Sunday.

The video, which was posted on Facebook Friday and has gained over a million views, recorded the five-minute interaction. "This is Myers Park, SouthPark, b****. Why are you up in here hanging out?"

A guest who appeared on a Fox News panel on Sunday suggested that CNN’s news coverage was a contributing factor behind a bomb being sent to the network’s offices last week. Emily Jashinsky, an editor for The Federalist online magazine, at first condemned the attempts at violence, such as the suspicous package sent to CNN, but then caveated her condemnation by arguing that the news network should try to understand where the anger is coming from. “When you see at rallies people chanting, ‘CNN sucks’ — I would never do it personally — but CNN makes no effort to understand why people feel that ... Far-right activist Laura Loomer, who often propagates conspiracy theories online, responded to criticism about her credibility by saying she had five headlines on the right-wing Drudge Report. Loomer was responding to a message posted by a women's march staffer, Sophie Ellman-Golan, who tweeted that Loomer is "not a journalist. She's a troll who intentionally spreads false information." Loomer hit back, tweeting that "I have had 5 Drudge headlines *this year* alone." "1. I have a journalism degree 2.

Janet Sabriu recorded video showing the enraged stranger's bigoted remarks directed at her while her 2-year-old daughter watched from the backseat. Sabriu, who has been a U.S. citizen and Houston resident for nine years, was on her way to early voting Thursday afternoon along Wirt Road when she crossed paths with the man identified on social media as Charles Geier. The man's rant repeatedly refers to Sabriu as a "b***h" as he demands that she leave "his country." “You’re driving in two lanes, you stupid b***h.” Geier can be heard screaming out of his driver's side window.

The shirts promote "Blexit," a spin on "Brexit," which referred to the U.K. leaving the European Union. The clothing was released at a Young Black Leadership Summit in Washington organized by Turning Point USA communications director Candace Owens. "Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West," Owens said.

President Donald Trump continued to mock progressive Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday, citing her recent DNA test results that revealed she very likely had a Native American ancestor. “We can’t use Pocahontas anymore, she’s got no Indian blood!” he told a man in the crowd of a rally in southern Illinois, The Daily Beast reported. “I have more than she does and I have none,” he quipped. “So I can’t call her Pocahontas anymore but I think I will anyway, do you mind?” Warren's DNA test, which showed “strong evidence” the senator had a Native ancestor, has received significant cr...

A source close to Kelly told Vanity Fair "she wants to come back," to Fox News, where she was an anchor for 13 years. The biggest question is whether Fox News would take her. At this point, the chances of a return look bleak. Kelly is still a polarizing figure within Fox News due to "her tangled history with the president." A source close to Fox News' co-chairman, Lachlan Murdoch, says that "[Murdoch is] extremely pleased with the current lineup." There are still ... Amid the aftermath of the 11-person massacre at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an anti-Semitic act fueled by hate, President Donald Trump called for stricter enforcement of the death penalty and theorized that the shooting may not have occurred if an armed guard were present. Pittsburgh Mayor Phil Peduto disagreed with that notion. “I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards or schools filled with armed guards," Peduto told NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday morning.

The Dodgers, who are competing against the Boston Red Sox in the championship series, already had one out and one runner on base in the inning when Roberts made the decision.

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on Sunday, even during a moment of silence for the victims of the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Blackburn, in a statement, said a "liberal angry mob" crashed her "Get Out The Vote" rally, and security officers removed several people after "appalling" and "despicable" disruptions. Before Blackburn even took the stage, several protesters had to be escorted out of the event. When Blackburn took the podium, she called for a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh, but a woman yelled out, "Marsha Blackburn is a white supremacist!" Some of Blackburn's supporters tried to shout the women and other protesters down as they were removed.

On "Fox & Friends" Monday, Dan Bongino said the protest during the moment of silence was "gross," and he called on Democrats to "loudly denounce" this type of extreme incivility in politics. "We're waiting to hear it," Bongino said. "Can we get to a point in this country where we just say when something is so incredibly black and white and so wrong like that? That they just come out and say, 'No, we don't stand for this. This isn't us. Not today,' especially after the events of the weekend?"

---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/horrific-crime-scene-pittsburgh-synagogue-203803649.html---split---It was “a very horrific crime scene” inside the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday after a gunman burst in during Sabbath services and shot more than a dozen people, according to the city’s top law-enforcement officer. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve been on some plane crashes,” Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said, his voice breaking. “It’s — it’s very bad.” Police sources told reporters that a man, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, yelled, “All Jews must die!” before opening fire, killing 11 people, presumably worshippers, and wounding six others, including four police officers, during a rampage that lasted approximately 20 minutes. None of the victims was a child. Bowers was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with police and arrested. He is expected to face federal hate-crime charges. Stephen Weiss, a resident of Squirrel Hill, was attending the services scheduled from 9:45 a.m. until noon on Saturday. He told the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette that he could hear the loud gunfire, which sounded like an automatic weapon, as he ran to the basement, where he found other Tree of Life members sheltered in place. “It sounded like a loud crash in the hallway,” Weiss said. Michael Eisenberg, the former president of Tree of Life, told ABC7 Eyewitness News that he was getting dressed just before 10 a.m. so that he could attend morning services. The synagogue’s vice president called to tell him that there was an active shooter and to ask if he could check out what was happening, he said. “I tried heading up Shady Avenue to the building, and it was entirely blocked off — 20 or so police cars, policemen with rifles drawn, aimed at the building; they quickly told me to get away,” Eisenberg said. “Just a surreal vision for me. I still can’t process it.” Rabbi Chuck Diamond was surrounded by reporters from several media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting. He said he had worked at Tree of Life until about a year ago and that the synagogue has had active-shooter drills in the past. But there was no security in place on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. “On Shabbat there’s no security. I have to tell you I always in the back of mind [thought] something like this might happen because of the way of the world today,” Diamond said. He continued, “As a Jewish professional and with what’s going on in the world, even though we’ve been fairly safe here in Pittsburgh, it’s just something that’s in the back of your mind.” Aaron Martin, an investigative reporter for WPXI, a local television station, conducted an emotional interview with a man who had close ties to the synagogue and whose father-in-law was inside the synagogue when the gunfire started but escaped to safety. “My father-in-law was inside. I got married in that place. This is crazy. This is unbelievable. People have to stop hating. It has to stop,” he told Martin. Fred Rabner, a member of the Tree of Life, described the synagogue as a “close-knit community” in an interview with CNN. He said everyone was calling one another to see whether their loved ones were harmed. “Everyone is just shaken up and upset,” Rabner said. “It’s awful, it’s just awful.” Danielle Manko, 32, a woman who lives across the street from the shooting suspect’s most recent listed address, told Yahoo News, “He’s usually never there.” “I haven’t seen him in probably, like, three weeks maybe,” she said. “They kept to themselves is pretty much what they did.” Federal investigators have already classified the mass shooting as a hate crime. The Anti-Defamation League said it is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington released the following statement in response to the shooting in Pittsburgh: “The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum strongly condemns the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and sends its deepest sympathies to the victims and families of those who were callously murdered. “Before opening fire, the alleged perpetrator reportedly yelled, ‘All Jews must die!’ The Museum reminds all Americans of the dangers of unchecked hatred and antisemitism which must be confronted wherever they appear and calls on all Americans to actively work to promote social solidarity and respect the dignity of all individuals.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News:

Updated at 6:50 a.m. ET Monday The alternative social media network that was reportedly used by the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue is now down. Gab.com is a social network that touts itself as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook to give conservatives a platform for free speech. But it has also been criticized for providing a platform for anti-Semitism and white nationalism. The site has come in for increased scrutiny since the shooting. As of Monday, the site displayed a message saying it had been "systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting pro...

Flight JT610 departed from the Indonesian capital at 6:20 a.m. local time, bound for Pangkal Pinang, an island east of Sumatra.

Updated at 4:03 p.m. ET Eleven people were killed on Saturday when a gunman entered Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and opened fire on the congregants. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97; eight were men, three were women. Two of them were brothers, and two were a married couple. Chuck Diamond was a rabbi at Tree of Life until about a year ago, and he remains a member of the community, living just around the corner from the synagogue. He knew many of the victims. "These are wonderful people, good souls, who were just coming to synagogue as they usually did," he told NPR on Sunday. "... Janet Winston had a rash that wouldn't go away.

So, as Winston often does for specialized treatment, she turned to Stanford Health Care, a nearly six-hour drive south. She hoped to fina...

Killing in a synagogue. Explosives in the mail. Deadly hurricanes. A grisly murder of a journalist inside a foreign consulate. Troops ordered to the border to block desperate migrants crossing Mexico in search of America. It may be that none of the dramatic events of this month will be decisive in determining the outcome of the midterm elections next month. But don't try to tell any of the candidates that. That's why everyone in politics either dreads or dreams of the "October surprise," the late-in-campaign event or issue that sudde... At a press conference Sunday morning, officials said victims of a shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue range in age from 54 to 97. All but two of the victims were over the age of 65, and include one married couple, and two brothers. Six others were wounded, including four police officers.

Updated at 12:14 a.m. ET on Sunday Federal prosecutors have charged Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old suspected gunman who carried out a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, with 29 counts in the deaths of 11 people, The Associated Press reports. "Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe," Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, according to the AP, describing the massacre as a "terrible and unspeakable act of hate." Officials in Pittsburgh reported 11 people, none of them children, were... The Trump administration is fending off six lawsuits across the country over a citizenship question that has been added to the 2020 census for, officials insist, one primary reason — to get better data on who in the country is and isn't a U.S. citizen. Last December, the Justice Department sent a letter to the Census Bureau asking for the hotly contested question to be included on forms for the upcoming national head count. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, responded in March by approving plans to add the question. But days after the Census Bureau received the Justice... Robert Bowers, the suspect in the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, surrendered to police, and officials say he is in fair condition at Allegheny General Hospital with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities say that while Bowers' motive remains unknown, "we believe he was acting alone." Eleven people were killed in the attack, and six were injured. "We're in the early stages of this investigation," Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, told reporters during an afternoon press conference.

In a span of less than 24 hours this past week, the Trump administration took two seemingly contradictory actions that could have profound effects on the insurance marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act. Health analysts say that at least one of the efforts, coupled with previous changes initiated by the administration, could help transform the insurance market to be much more like it was before the 2010 federal health law took effect — when regulation, coverage and consumer protections varied widely across the United States. The week's first move came on Monday morning, when Trump's... President Trump and Senate Republicans are remaking the federal courts in their own image. Prior to the Trump administration, there was plenty of tit for tat in the escalating partisan wars over judicial nominations. But these tactics were aimed at blocking nominees. Since Trump was sworn in, however, the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges, casting aside long-existing practices and traditions that ensured some consensus in picking the judges who sit on the federal courts of appeal. Gone, for all practical purposes, is the tradition that prevente...

---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/synagogue-shooting-shows-spread-anti-semitism-far-right-225317069.html---split---Before opening fire on a synagogue full of people in Pittsburgh on Saturday, killing 11 and injuring six others, including four police officers, suspected gunman Robert Bowers reportedly yelled, “All Jews must die!” The 48-year-old Bowers, who was taken into police custody after the shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue, is believed to have acted alone in what the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said is “likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.” “It is simply unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning, and unthinkable that it would happen in the United States of America in this day and age,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement Saturday. “Unfortunately, this violent attack — the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the United States since 2014 — occurs at time when ADL has reported a historic increase in both anti-Semitic incidents and anti-Semitic online harassment.” The earlier incident referenced by Greenblatt was the 2014 shooting, by a former Ku Klux Klan “grand dragon” and neo-Nazi, at two Jewish community centers outside Kansas City that left three people dead. Since then, organizations like the ADL and others observed a dramatic rise in anti-Semitism in the United States. In its annual Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents, the ADL reported nearly 2,000 cases of harassment, vandalism and physical assault targeting Jews in 2017 — 57 percent more than the year before. It was the largest single-year increase since the organization first began tracking such data in 1979, and it marked the highest number of anti-Semitic incidents on record since 1994. In particular, anti-Semitic incidents in schools and college campuses nearly doubled in 2017 for the second year in a row, contributing in part to the overall spike last year. Some of the incidents in the ADL report came from the left, in the form of “references, accusations and conspiracy theories” directed against Jews over “purported support for Israel.” “Without a doubt, we’ve seen an increase in anti-Semitic incidents,” said Adam Hertzman, director of marketing for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. Hertzman told Yahoo News on Saturday that “in general, Pittsburgh has been one of the safest cities, in terms of the Jewish community, in the United States,” but the city has not been exempt from this national trend. Two years ago, he said, the Jewish Federation hired a Jewish Community security director in response to the rise in such incidents, which has included the dissemination of neo-Nazi literature and imagery, such as swastikas. “Largely it has not been incidents of violence,” he said, adding that that is “one of the reasons we’re more shocked at this situation,” referring to Saturday’s shooting. In another recent study published on Friday, the researchers with the ADL found a significant increase in online attacks targeting Jewish politicians, journalists and others in the lead-up to next month’s midterm elections. The report found that both robot and human-run accounts were responsible for anti-Semitic tweets, leading researchers to conclude, “Both anonymity and automation have been used in online propaganda offensives against the Jewish community during the 2018 midterms.” Bowers appears to have participated in his trend. Among other social media networks, the suspect in Saturday’s shooting was active on Gab, a site popular among white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists. Bowers’s account was quickly deactivated shortly after his name was made public, but a link to his archived profile offers a glimpse at the kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric he posted, beginning with the line “jews are the children of satan” in his user bio. Two of his most recent posts, including one apparently posted this morning, refer to HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid to refugees in the U.S. According to a statement published on Medium, Gab administrators said they had suspended Bowers’s profile once they were alerted to a verified account matching the name of the suspected shooter, first backing up the user data on Bowers’s account and then alerting the FBI to its existence. “We are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see to it that justice is served,” they wrote, adding, “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” The statement attempts to dispel negative perceptions of the Gab community, insisting that the social network’s “mission is very simple: to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people.” But Bowers’s views are common on Gab. Many of the anti-Semitic posts found in Bowers’s archived feed had been reposted from the accounts of other Gab users. The ADL study on anti-Semitism leading up to the 2018 midterms also suggested a link between the rise in such attacks and the election of President Trump. Prior to the 2016 election, “anti-Semitic harassment and attacks were rare and unexpected, even for Jewish Americans who were prominently situated in the public eye,” states the report. “Following his election, anti-Semitism has become normalized and harassment is a daily occurrence.” One of the most frequently attacked individuals is George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who was among the targets of pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and members of the media earlier this week. A Florida man who identifies as a Trump supporter was arrested Friday in connection with the attempted bombings. Bowers, judging from his postings, was not a fan of Trump, whom he evidently considered insufficiently tough on foreigners, writing, “Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist. There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation.” Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are observant Jews. Following initial reports of Saturday’s shooting, Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, speculated to Yahoo News about what the gunman — whose identity was unknown at that point — might have in common with Cesar Altieri Sayoc, the suspect arrested Friday in the attempted mail bombings. “Once again, we’ve seen people … who are motivated by extremist ideas and ideologies willing to be engaged in violence,” said Beirich. “We have way too much domestic terrorism emerging from white supremacists and far-right extremists,” she continued, adding that while “that’s been going on for a long time, it doesn’t help when Trump stokes these things.” Trump has faced criticism for his response to the mailings of the pipe bombs, which were sent to high-profile critics of the president and frequent subjects of his own attacks. After initially suggesting that Saturday’s deadly events could have been avoided “if they had some kind of a protection inside the temple,” Trump later struck a more sympathetic tone at the annual Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis, where he condemned the shootings as “pure evil” and referred to them as “an anti-Semitic act.” “You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don’t seem to learn from the past,” he said, before launching into another denunciation of globalists.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/active-shooter-reported-near-pittsburgh-synagogue-n925211---split---A gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue where Sabbath services were taking place Saturday morning, killing at least 11 people and wounding several police officers before he was taken into custody, officials said. The attack at Tree of Life synagogue began sometime before 9:54 a.m., when police were called about an active shooter inside the house of worship in the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which is considered to be a historic Jewish enclave and center for Jewish life in Pittsburgh. At least 11 adults were killed in the shooting, and six people were injured, including four police officers, officials said. Dr. Don Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said a 70-year-old man and a 55-year-old officer were in critical condition. "It's a very horrific crime scene. It’s one of the worst that I've seen," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. "It's very bad." The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, of nearby Baldwin, was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, authorities said. After entering the synagogue, Bowers allegedly opened fire and as he exited the building, a Pittsburgh police officer engaged him, according to Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office. Bowers then allegedly shot the officer and retreated back into the synagogue to hide from approaching SWAT officers, Jones said. Two officers who were the first responders to the scene were struck, and two SWAT officers were struck inside the building, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. Yealy said one of the injured officers suffered grazing wounds. Hissrich said Bowers was shot multiple times. Jones said the crime scene was the most horrific he'd witnessed in his career with the FBI. Bowers was charged Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Scott W. Brady announced. He is also charged with 11 counts of obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and other counts. Social media accounts that appear to belong to Bowers contained posts with anti-Semitic messages and hate speech. Bowers reportedly said "All Jews must die" before opening fire in the synagogue. Hissrich said the FBI would be leading the investigation. The Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety tweeted that the shooting would be prosecuted as a hate crime. Congregants told MSNBC that a circumcision celebration, known as a bris, was taking place in the synagogue this morning. Jeff Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh since 2004, told NBC News affiliate WPXI that he rushed to the area when he heard about the shooting. "I just feel horrible for all those people inside,” Finkelstein said. “You know, everyone thinks about Israel in situations like this. It’s just shocking to come back to Squirrel Hill and see something like this.” Rabbi Chuck Diamond, a former spiritual leader of Tree of Life, told reporters that he never spoke to his congregation about what to do during a shooting, but it's something he thought about. "There's a lot of anti-Semitism out there and a lot of hate out there," Diamond said. "Sobering that it's touched our community." Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of Tree of Life synagogue who lives about a block from the building, told the Associated Press that he was getting ready for services when he received a phone call from a member who works with Pittsburgh's Emergency Services, saying he had been notified through scanner and other communications that there was an active shooter at their synagogue. "I ran out of the house without changing and I saw the street blocked with police cars. It was a surreal scene. And someone yelled, 'Get out of here.' I realized it was a police officer along the side of the house. ... I am sure I know all of the people, all of the fatalities. I am just waiting to see," Eisenberg said. He said officials at the synagogue had not gotten any threats that he knew of prior to the shooting. The synagogue maintenance employees had recently checked all of the emergency exits and doors to make sure they were cleared and working. "I spoke to a maintenance person who was in the building and heard the shots. He was able to escape through one of the side exit doors we had made sure was functioning," Eisenberg told the AP. President Donald Trump said at the National Future Farmers of America Convention and Expo in Indiana on Saturday that "this was an anti-Semitic act." "You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past," he said. "Our minds cannot comprehend the cruel hate and the twisted malice that could cause a person to unleash such terrible violence during a baby naming ceremony." Earlier in the day he tweeted, "Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way." Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf praised police and first responders, saying: "I am in awe of the bravery displayed by law enforcement, those folks who helped to keep people safe, to aid victims and to prevent further tragedy." "We simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American life," Wolf said. "These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Pennsylvanians. They’re not who we are as Americans." Trump ordered the flag at the White House and at federal and military facilities lowered to half-staff. Flags were also ordered lowered to half-staff at the Pennsylvania capitol complex and other state facilities in honor of the victims. Across the country, cities said they would be stepping up police presence at houses of worship, including in New York City, Baltimore and Los Angeles. In Atlanta, police were also dispatched to synagogues. Peter Berg, senior rabbi at The Temple, told NBC affiliate WXIA that he was “devastated” to learn of the “horrifically tragic shooting” in Pittsburgh. “This is an incident of explicit anti-Semitism,” he said. Shabbat morning services began at 9:45 a.m. at Tree of Life, which is close to Carnegie Mellon University, according to its website. The Conservative congregation was founded more than 150 years ago and is led by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who came to the synagogue in August 2017. Squirrel Hill is considered a historic Jewish enclave and center for Jewish life in Pittsburgh. It is home to more than a quarter of Jewish households in the Pittsburgh-area, according to a Brandeis University study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community. More than 80 percent of Squirrel Hill residents said they had some concern or were very concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism. Many also reported incidents of anti-Semitic experiences in the past year, from insults and stereotypes to physical threats or attacks, according to the study. Michael Gottlieb, who has been a member of the Tree of Life and who was bar mitzvahed and had his two children bar mitzvahed there and who was married by the rabbi, told WPXI that he can’t understand the level of hate that motivated the attack. “Whatever got us to this point where people do these kinds of things — we have to find a way to come together as a community, and as a world, so these things don’t happen again,” Gottlieb said. “It usually happens somewhere else. This time it hit here. It’s hard,” he said. “I don’t know what you can say. This is absolutely senseless. This was driven out of hate,” Gottlieb said. “There’s a lot of hate in this world right now. We have to get rid of the hate somehow.” Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter for NBC News, based in New York.

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently said she would introduce the Equality Act as one of her first orders of business if Democrats retake the House in November. Pelosi made the announcement at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, telling the crowd the issue of equal rights for the LGBTQ community ... EAGAN, Minn. (AP) — Angie Craig came so close to winning a seat in Congress that she wasn't ready to give up. The former medical technology executive turned Democratic politician lost by less than 2 points in 2016 to Jason Lewis, a conservative former talk radio host who styled himself on the air as "Mr. Right" and whose past on-air remarks continue to be an issue. Within a few months, she filed for a rematch. The suburban 2nd District is one of four House contests in Minnesota that could flip from one party to another. With Democrats within range of gaining the 23 seats they need to take c... WASHINGTON (AP) — A battle is brewing between the Trump administration and some of the president's biggest supporters in Congress who are concerned that sanctions to be re-imposed on Iran early next month won't be tough enough. As President Donald Trump prepares to re-impose a second batch of Iran sanctions that had been eased under the 2015 nuclear deal, conservative lawmakers and outside advisers have become worried that the administration may break a promise to exert "maximum pressure" on Iran. They are angered by suggestions that measures to be announced Nov. 5 won't include a provision... COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka is in a constitutional stalemate, torn between two leaders who both claim to be its legitimate prime minister. President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and dissolved his Cabinet on Friday, abruptly ending a strained coalition government between two traditionally opposed political parties. Former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new prime minister and Parliament was suspended, sowing economic and political uncertainty in the South Asian island nation. A look at Sri Lanka and the origins of its ongoi...

Millions of Shia Muslims from around the world are making the journey to the holy shrines of their saints Hussein and Abbas in Karbala, Iraq, in a pilgrimage that is as much about camaraderie as religion. The annual commemoration, called Arbeen, brings more pilgrims each year than the Hajj, in Saudi Arabia, yet it is hardly known outside Islam.

ATLANTA (AP) — Former President Jimmy Carter is wading into the contentious Georgia governor's race with a personal appeal to Republican candidate Brian Kemp: Resign as secretary of state to avoid damaging public confidence in the outcome of his hotly contested matchup with Democrat Stacey Abrams. The 94-year-old Carter's request, made in an Oct. 22 letter obtained by The Associated Press , is the latest turn in a campaign whose closing month is being defined by charges of attempted voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud. Kemp has thus far dismissed Democratic demands...

---split---5.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMNPe-QowztHmAg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---Another day, another Twitter controversy. But instead of Trump's tweets, Twitter itself is causing controversy. Off the back of the revelation that the man suspected of sending bombs to Trump critics had also been sending death threats via the social media site, people are once again calling on the platform to tackle a culture of online abuse and threatening language. You might think that Twitter would be unveiling a new set of guidelines or introduce stricter rules, but instead it has reportedly decided to remove the "like" button. No, we're not sure why either. The move will apparently be... A Filipino family were at the mercy of a woman who told them to 'go home' because New Zealand 'is for white people only' in a disgusting racist attack while they were visiting the country. Krizia Egipto, who according to the Daily Mail has lived in New Zealand for four years, and her family were holidaying in Wellington, buying coffee at a shop when another Filipino man came over to talk to them. This apparently angered a woman, sitting nearby smoking, because she shouted: Don't come back here any more. You're not welcome here. This is only for white people. This country is for white people... In the wake of the horrific antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the lives of 11 people, a group of Jewish leaders have written an open letter to president Donald Trump. The letter says that Trump is not welcome in Pittsburgh while he continues to fan the flames of white nationalism and make divisive statements about minorities. Members of Bend the Arc, a progressive Jewish group, penned the declaration after what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jewish people in US history. The letter states: For the past three years your words and your policies have embo... Brexit may mean Brexit, but thankfully it also means memes. Chancellor Philip Hammond looks set to find this out the hard way after the annual “chancellor working hard before the budget statement” photo set hit the internet. This year’s photo set features Hammond reading his budget statement while sipping on a mug emblazoned with his own name. Because that was never going to be a bad idea, was it?

In the seemingly endless stream of racism cropping up over the world, lo and behold there's another white person being disgustingly racist towards two black sisters. Susan Westwood, who was drunk at the time, was filmed shouting racist abuse at her black neighbour and her sister as they were waiting in their shared car park. The video, which was posted to Facebook on Friday, shows Susan Westwood approaching the two women Chele and Leisa calling them 'b***h' and can be heard asking 'Is your baby daddy here?' The 51-year-old from Charlotte, North Carolina was heard shouting 'I'm white and I'm... Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. Bolsonaro won 55 per cent of the votes cast against 45 per cent for his left-wing opponent Fernando Haddad. Bolsonaro campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and a promise to eradicate crime. His victory constitutes a swing to the political right. Following the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff in 2016, the country has been led by conservative Michel Temer, who has been unpopular. Bolsonaro is a deeply divisive figure whose remarks on a range of issues, such as an apparent support for torture and hostility to... Chancellor Philip Hammond is set to announce a new 50p Brexit coin during the 2018 Budget and it feels a bit like a slap in the face to anyone who voted to remain. In what's being hailed as a 'a victory for The Sun' the seven-sided coin will bear the phrase 'Friendship With All Nations' and it is going to be available from March 29 next year. Clearly the phrase etched into the coin is supposed to send a positive signal to the world, but it instead comes off a little passive aggressive. It would seem that Mr Hammond has a rather warped idea of how friendship works, perhaps the coin was meant... Just in time for Halloween - the spookiest time of the year - an optical illusion has got the Internet squawking, or purring, with excitement. A viral image, tweeted by @RobertMaguire_ and originally found on Reddit, has gone viral for an unexpected reason.

On Tuesday, Melania Trump invited 30 sixth grade students from Digital Pioneers Academy to join her and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the White House Family Theatre as part of her 'Be Best' campaign in National Bullying Prevention Month. During their visit, she showed the film Wonder, a 2017 movie about a boy with Treacher Collins syndrome, which creates facial deformities, that has an anti-bullying message. A spokesperson for the First Lady told The Hill: The movie celebrates ... Following the news of the horrific shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, a crowdfunding campaign started by two Muslim groups has raised more than $40,000 for the victims. Incredibly, the campaign reached its $25,000 goal in a few short hours and is now nearing $50,000. The fundraising page reads: The Muslim-American community extends its hands to help the shooting victims, whether it is the injured victims or the Jewish families who have lost loved ones. We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. The fundraise... If you thought 2018 would be the year that all white people would realise that darkening their skin to dress as a black person is racist, you’d be wrong. A London tube passenger spotted wearing “blackface” on the tube. The woman can be heard saying “It’s a bit racist that you put black make-up on”, trying to calmly point out the various ethical issues with Halloween costumes like this. When confronted by the passenger, the man shrugged and asked “Why not?” The video was posted to Twitter with the caption “It’s 2018? How is this still happening?” It’s 2018 ? How is this still happening ? pic... Each year when people celebrate Halloween, problematic costumes are a depressingly regular feature. This year, a dad has said he regrets dressing himself and his son in Nazi costumes. A picture of Bryant Goldbach and his son was posted online and has been sparking outrage, with the father dressed as a Nazi and his son as Adolf Hitler. Goldbach says he originally did it for historical purposes but now acknowledges the costume was in poor taste. He said: I think it was in bad taste for me to let my child to wear that, probably for me to wear that. It didn't occur to me. I thought it was a bad... President Trump is known for his weird habits, such as his now legendary sideways handshake. Love him or loathe him, he's never afraid to do things a little - or a lot - differently. In very serious breaking news, it's emerged that the president, the leader of the free world, doesn't seem to know how to use an umbrella. This earth shattering revelation was revealed as Trump boarded the presidential plane, Air Force One. Before entering the aircraft, he paused, before leaving his open umbrella at the door. The umbrella was left, eerily hovering open outside the air craft for all to see. loo... The world is still reeling from the news of the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The aftershocks of the shooting, in which a gunman killed 11 people after shouting that Jews "need to die", have been felt across the world. Unfortunately, with a figure as divisive as president Trump, many Americans are in the position of having a leader who they simply don't trust to act appropriately in important moments such as this. To many, Trump proved this once again as he made a speech to the annual Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis. There had been whispers that his spee... The Vancouver Police Department Canine Unit releases a K9 calendar each year and this installation has not disappointed.

But that doesn’t stop everyone from thinking they’re a critic. Recently, Reddit user I-Have-A-Headache got their own share of this irritating part of human nature. After getting back into art after studying biology, the artist became fascinated with exploring the female form. She has shared an exchange with a supposedly refined art collector, who took offence to the subject matter of her work. When he realised a piece of her work featured female masturbation, he continually low-balled her, reducing the price and labelling it “inappropriate”. Dumb... From Hurricane Maria to Charlottesville and high school shootings, president Trump's responses to horrific events have frequently drawn criticism. After the news broke that a gunman had opened fire in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the president's reaction has been widely condemned.

The decision to pander to what is essentially a talking point from the National Rifle Association - that the answer to... Earlier this month Kanye West made headlines around the world following his bizarre meeting with Donald Trump at the White House. He said many odd things during his discussion with the president including rants about 'Superman' and 'hydrogen planes.' It was all very strange and nobody was quite sure what to make of it but despite everyone seemingly having their say no one has heard what his in-laws, the Kardashian's thought. In an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the mother of the family, Kris Jenner attempted to shed some light on how she felt about he son-in-laws controversial sup... Earlier this year The Simpsons was dogged by accusations of perpetuating stereotypes of Indian-Americans in the character of Apu. The convenience store worker had been in the show since 1990 but a failure to progress his characteristics had seen viewers in 2018 brand Apu as racist and problematic. The show and its creators had clumsily tried to address the accusations but now they have seemingly decided that they would rather not engage with any further discussions around Apu by announcing that he will be axed from the show. Speaking to Indie Wire, producer Adi Shankar, who was working on a... Hold the front page! A cat just walked down the catwalk in Turkey - and people can't get enough. Footage has emerged of the sassy feline strutting her stuff on the aptly named 'catwalk' during Esmond International Fashion Show in Istanbul, Turkey, on Friday. Speaking to The Dodo about the unexpected attendant at the show, fashion designer Goksen Hakki Ali commented: Everybody was in shock After footage of the feline was posted onto Instagram, it quickly went viral, with over 100,000 views: View this post on Instagram Ahahahahahah #catwalk #real #vakkoesmod A post shared by H (@hknylcn) on ... A teacher in the US state of Iowa is under investigation after being photographed wearing blackface at a Halloween party. It is thought that Mega Luloff, who is a teacher at Walcott Elementary, was impersonating the character LaFawnduh from the 2004 movie Napoleon Dynamite. In the images which were shared online, the 32-year-old is seen wearing a black wig as well as having black makeup on her arms, face and neck. Her photograph has since been removed from the school's website, while NAACP officials are calling on the Davenport School District administrators to fire the teacher. Betty Andre... On Friday, 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of sending 'explosive devices' to leading Democrats and CNN. A van that belonged to the Florida native was also ceased by the authorities, with the vehicle being adorned in numerous stickers supporting Donald Trump as well as attacking his opponents. Footage of the van began airing on all major news networks but a viral tweet sent by screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer, claimed that Fox News were censoring the stickers during their coverage. Fox News is blurring out the stickers on the van. Fox News is blurring out the stickers on the... Right-wing commentator Candace Owens is being criticised on Twitter after she deleted a tweet promoting a conspiracy theory relating to the recent bomb scares in America. The 29-year-old who can count Kanye West as one of her fans chose to remove a post that she shared on Wednesday claiming that the packages sent to leading Democrats and CNN were not sent by conservatives. She added that she found the fact that the bombs were sent during the midterm elections campaign was 'suspicious.'

The American political commentator Rochelle Ritchie has claimed that Twitter failed to act after she was sent threats by Cesar Sayoc, who has been arrested in connection with the 'explosive devices' sent to critics of Donald Trump this week. Ritchie, who has previously worked as the press secretary for the House Democrats, has stated that she received threatening messages from Sayoc earlier this month, after making an appearance on Fox News on October 2. Although Sayoc's Twitter account has now been suspended, Ritchie had taken screenshots of the messages that he sent to her and in a tweet ... This week numerous 'explosive devices' have been sent to critics of Donald Trump, including Barack Obama, Robert De Niro and Hillary Clinton. In times like this, you would hope that even her strongest of critics would show some sympathy. That wasn't the case at a Republican rally in Wisconsin where crowds chanted "lock her up" just hours after the device was sent to her and Bill Clinton's home in New York. It was a similar sight in the White House on Friday, where young conservative supporters of Trump chanted "CNN sucks" just days after the news network was also a target in the bomb scares... It should come as no surprise to you that being a mother is an extremely difficult and an oftentimes underappreciated job. One woman has decided to literally illustrate her frustrations to show her husband and it's an amazing sight. Meet Mattea Goff, she's married to Kris and they have two children, Seleste, 5, and Aurora, 5 months old. On Thursday 11 October, Mattea was struggling to find the best way to convey how stressed and exhausted she is to her husband, as he was struggling to understand just why she was so cranky in the morning. That's where the idea of drawing the problem came abo... Barack Obama returned to the political arena on Friday to lend his support to Democrats running for office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Speaking to the masses, the former president was on his typical charismatic form and didn't pull any punches when referring to Donald Trump and the Republicans. You may recall an article from the New York Times which was published on Wednesday which claimed that Chinese and Russian spies are routinely eavesdropping in on calls that Trump makes on his iPhone. Trump has already denied this and claimed on Twitter that he only uses government phones and that the ar... At the risk of mansplaining, it's probably a safe bet to say that everyone who experiences periods knows they're not fun. Another thing which is no doubt infuriating is the apparent lack of education, or pure ignorance, when it comes to tampons and female hygiene in general. Half of the world's population needs to use feminine hygiene products a week each month, every single month, for nearly 30 years. Which of course is a pricey bill to foot, considering how these products are inexplicably taxed to hike the price instead of being considered as a basic necessity. One particular story was sh... Avengers 4 is fast approaching and the fan theories just won't stop coming. After Avengers: Infinity War left us with a monster cliffhanger as to the fate of our beloved superheroes and people have been going wild, trying to figure out how the good guys will come back from this and beat Thanos after he wiped out half of the population of the universe. A new fan theory coming out could make a lot of sense and it regards none other than Mr Nick Fury himself. If you recall, in Infinity War before being dissolved into some sort of human dust, Fury sends a message on a mysterious pager-esque dev... President Donald Trump’s presidency has been blighted by serious and chilling blunders. From taking two days to condemn white supremacists following Charlottesville, to mocking alleged sexual assault survivor Dr Christine Blasey Ford, most people would think that there’s no way he could go any lower. But, as has become the norm, they’d be wrong. Following the news that Democratic Party politicians including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, alongside Trump critics including Robert De Niro and news network CNN, were targeted by postal explosives, the president took to Twi... Although most people would like to think that they have empathy for others, it's rare to see acts of compassion actually take place in public. When they actually happen, they are sometimes small favours or acts of solidarity. Other times they can be acts of such heartwarming sensitivity that they leave you speechless. That brings us to this viral story of two men who decided to help out an older woman who they had noticed was paying for the petrol for her car with change. They reached out to her and gave her a handful of cash to make her situation a little easier. The astounded woman breaks... Twitter might have helped to give us president Trump and Brexit, but there’s life in the blue bird yet. Today Channel 4’s official Twitter account has done something than millions of people in the UK would love to do: it told Piers Morgan to “go f*** himself”. Yes, that’s right, in the below tweet, the pioneering TV channel didn’t hold back in letting one of Britain’s most loathed man know how it feels. Dear @PiersMorgan.

A 16-year-old black girl has appeared on an episode of the US talk show Dr Phil insisting that she is caucasian. The girl, named Treasure, believes that she is a white person and that she is superior to other black people. She appeared on the show with her mother and brother, who had contacted Dr Phil, in the hope that his expertise in psychology could help her out of fears in regards to her mental well-being. In a clip played before she spoke in front of the live studio audience, Treasure explained why her appearance, specifically citing the natural straightness of her hair, is a key indic... In a time when the news seems bleak, thank goodness for gay penguins. That’s right, the cute-o-meter is about to be broken by the news that same-sex penguin couple, Sphen and Magic, have successfully incubated an egg together at the Sydney aquarium. Apparently this came about after the pair discovered they were "absolute naturals" as parents. The egg was kindly donated by another couple who had one too many. The egg was fostered to Sphen and Magic from another couple who had two, and did not have the resources to look after both 👍 — Sea Life Sydney Aquarium (@Sydney_Aquarium) October 26, 2... As we've documented numerous times on indy100,racism in America is rife and it doesn't appear to be getting any better. Hate speech directed at black people and white people idly calling the police on minorities for absolutely nothing is almost a daily occurrence now. Now it appears that people who aren't white can't even go for a drive in a car with their children without suffering abuse. A video shared by Twitter user Santiago Mayer shows a woman, who is said to be a friend of his mother, being subjected to a string of racist insults and references to her appearance, while waiting at tra... Trans activist and reality star Caitlyn Jenner has ended her support for president Donald Trump over his assault on trans rights. The Olympic gold medalist, who supported Trump over Hillary Clinton and even attended his inauguration ball, said she had "remained hopeful" that she could work with Mr Trump's administration. But in an op-ed for the Washington Post, she admitted that she had got it wrong, admitting her position had been a "mistake". She wrote: The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president. The president has caused international outcry a... Vaccinations seem like a no brainer when it comes to protecting your children from disease, but there are no shortage of debates between anti-vaxxers and rational people in the world. It's such a simple concept that even Benjamin Franklin, who was alive in the 1700s, was a staunch supporter of vaccinations. The founding father lost his son to smallpox in 1736, which caused him to pen a message in support of vaccination, which resonates even now. In the message, he was urging parents to inoculate their children - and despite the underdeveloped and basic science that existed in the 18th centu... Justin Bieber has done a lot of things to upset people, including getting really bad tattoos and telling people not to take photos of him. But people think he's gone too far this time. In the midst of a chaotic week, when he and his new wife Hailey Baldwin were seen arguing in public with her father, Bieber sat down on a park bench and ate a burrito. However, the way he chose to eat the burrito has caused some hysteria online. 'What do you mean?' We hear you ask. Well, take a look at this picture. Justin Bieber eating a burrito sideways. Enough said. Now, we aren't aware of any instruction... The president of Southampton University Students' Union has caused controversy after saying that a “mural of white men”, which pays homage to WW1 heroes, should be painted over. Reported by the BBC, Emily Dawes said on Twitter, in a now-deleted tweet: Mark my words - we're taking down the mural of white men in the uni senate room, even if I have to paint over it myself. The mural in question was painted by Sir William Rothenstein in 1916. It remembers students who lost their lives in the war and were unable to complete their degrees. The mural depicts a fallen soldier collecting his honorar... A 70 year-old man who was filmed racially abusing a passenger aboard a Ryanair flight has broken his silence. David Mesher was filmed calling 77 year-old Delsie Gayle a an “ugly black b******” and telling her not to speak to him in a foreign language on the flight. The footage sparked calls for a boycott of Ryanair after the airline appeared to take little action against Messer. Gayle, who’s husband died not long ago, even had to move seats on the flight from Spain to London. This racist white man refused to sit next to an elderly black woman on a Ryanair flight. He called her an "ugly blac... Michael Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing Stormy Daniels in her bid to sue Donald Trump, managed to put his foot in it on Thursday. Big time. During an interview with Time magazine, the 47-year-old commented on who the Democrats should put forward as their presidential nominee in 2020. Now, there are plenty of good candidates currently working for the Democrats including Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kamala Harris and even, at a stretch, Michelle Obama.

The title of Avengers 4 is being kept as a closely guarded secret, but that hasn't stopped people speculating what it might be. There have been suggestions that it might be called Avengers: End Game,but another title that is being thrown around the internet is Avengers: Annihilation. This may or may not have been the title that Mark Ruffalo revealed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon a few weeks ago, but it's a theory that is gathering speed. Directors Joe & Anthony Russo have stated that the name of the film was not uttered by any characters in Avengers: Infinity War, but it is possibl... Most people will tell you that getting a period isn’t always convenient. Depending on what a person is wearing, leaks can appear. While there’s nothing wrong with this completely normal bodily function, for teenagers it can be particularly uncomfortable. Most of the time, embarrassing period stories normally revolve around a person being the subject of unfair ridicule. It’s certainly rare that teenage boys come to the rescue in tales of awkward periods. But as a recent Reddit post revealed, it does happen. When a male classmate noticed his female peer’s stain on the bus, he did the humane t... Just when you thought you'd seen everything at a wedding, someone manages to go and set fire to the happy couple. Yes, this is the moment two adrenaline junkie brides set their dresses on FIRE after walking down the aisle. April Choi, 32, and Bethany Byrnes, 28, enlisted guests from their wedding parties to torch the gowns while they were still wearing them. Don't worry though, as although the dramatic footage shows flames engulfing their dresses, the garments were specially altered to make the trains detachable Picture: Sherry Schons / SWNS The same-sex couple - who are both variety entert... Most parents will have a moment in their lives when they will have to tackle playground bullies making their kids unhappy. More often than not, a stern talking to with parents can sort out problems, but sometimes it takes a different tactic – as one Houston dad recently found out. Too often, the cycle of abuse repeats itself. Hurt people deal with their emotions by bullying others. This is why, when Aubrey Fontenot heard his eight-year-old son Jordan was getting bullied by another boy at school named Tamarion, he decided to empathise After receiving permission from the supposed bully’s fami... This might come as a shock to you but Donald Trump supporters aren't big fans of his former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Yet, you would hope that on the day an explosive device was sent to her and Bill Clinton's home in Chappaqua, New York, they might show a little compasion. After all, an assassination attempt is nothing to laugh at. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case. At least not at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, where Trump devotees revived the old chant of "lock her up" as senator Leah Vukmir delivered a speech. Tonight: Trump crowd chants "lock her up" after bomb maile... On 23 October, Hollywood A-lister and expert troller Ryan Reynolds celebrated his 42nd birthday. While you sit there and wonder how someone could possibly look that good at that age, allow us to distract you from a mini-crisis of confidence with a small scrap between Deadpool and Wolverine. Well, not exactly the two superheroes, but the actors who play them - Mr Reynolds and Mr Hugh Jackman respectively. On the day of Reynolds' birth, Jackman wished him many happy returns on Twitter, but not before giving him a little dig about which of them is the nicest of the two. Because I’m told that I... Rami Malek has stepped into the shoes of pop icon and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury for his latest on-screen role. But Bohemian Rhapsody has so far been plagued by controversy. After trailers emerged, the film faced criticism as it appeared to erase the AIDS crisis and Mercury’s sexuality. Director Brian Singer has also faced allegations of sexual abuse in recent years, which he strongly denies. Given the negative vibes surrounding the film, you’d think its actors would be poised to put this right during their promotional appearances. However, the promo tour appears to have gotten off to a... The US midterm elections are just around the corner and, as always, their political debates are beginning to heat up, with jibes aplenty being thrown around. We've already seen some pretty outrageous stuff so far, including the campaign ad from David Brill, which featured possibly the best twist of all-time. Now we have probably the quickest takedown of a politician by an opponent when Florida gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis squared off. A particularly tense moment in the debate occurred when DeSantis was asked about his connections to David Horowitz, a radical conse... Chelsea Handler is known for her epic putdowns and super quick wit. But the comedian is now using her platform to address an important and serious cultural issue: white privilege. Handler stopped by Ellen to promote a new project with Netflix that explores her privilege as a white woman. She described to host Ellen DeGeneres how, following the 2016 presidential election, she began reading texts by black authors and exploring the benefits that her white skin has given her. She told DeGeneres how this made her “feel gross”, before discussing her discomfort at the fact that 53 per cent of whit... Following the discovery of the bombs sent to the homes of Barack Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton, as well as the New York office of CNN, you would expect a strongly worded statement from Donald Trump on Twitter. After all, it's not like he's ever lost for words on the website. Yet before the president could release his statement, his vice president Mike Pence sent out this tweet condemning the attempted attacks.

The volatility and division of American politics has reached disturbing new lows, with packages allegedly containing explosives being sent to president Obama, George Soros, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and the offices of news network CNN. Of course, given president Trump’s frequent attacks on the recipients of the devices, people are assuming the explosives were sent by someone who thinks they are working in his best interests. Whether it's "lock her up" chants about Hillary Clinton, taking two days to condemn white supremacists who murdered a woman in Charlottesville, praising a Montana congr... Yesterday, a series of explosive devices and suspicious packages were discovered at homes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as the New York offices of CNN. A similar device was also found at the home of billionaire philanthropist George Soros and other leading Democrats. The FBI is searching for suspects and have warned that other packages may still be undiscovered. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has labelled these attempts as "an act of terror" and, while it was fortunate that nobody was hurt, it does bring into further question the rhetoric that Donald Trump has promoted as... Yesterday, Tommy Robinson, aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, walked free from court after his contempt case was referred to the attorney by a judge at the Old Bailey. The 35-year-old far-right 'journalist' has become something of a figurehead in recent months for those that agree with his politics, many of whom waited outside the court and cheered when the outcome was confirmed. Robinson, who is the founder and former leader of the English Defence League, had been imprisoned in August for breaking reporting restrictions at Leeds Crown Court in May where the Huddersfield grooming gang were on trial... It’s as bad as it sounds. A white couple decided to create a weird photo shoot for their wedding, complete with fake Congolese militia. The bizarre photos feature a white bride in a whole host of awkward poses including being held at gunpoint by a black soldier and walking down a dirt road with little black children following. Another had the bride standing in front of a crowd of Congolese adults and children with the caption: “Just cruising thru the ghetto in Congo in a wedding dress." A different photo has a close up shot of what looks like her diamond wedding ring curled around an AK47 w... U2 aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea but you've got to hand it to Bono and his commitment to promoting his own ego. The Irish rockers aren't strangers to making political statements either and, at a concert in London on Tuesday night, Bono decided to share his thoughts on Brexit. Before they played the topical song 'Get Out Of Your Own Way,' Bono opted to address the crowd at the 02 Arena and share his thoughts on Britain's decision to leave the EU. The 58-year-old said: We’ve just been touring all across Europe and whatever you think about it, all we heard about from Madrid to Berlin to... A doctor in America shared the reason why he always tries to find the Facebook profile of a recently deceased patient - and it'll pluck at your heartstrings. Doctor Louis M Profeta, an emergency physician at St Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, says he checks the profiles of those who have died so he can remain compassionate when he breaks the devastating news to their loved ones. He took to LinkedIn, where he admitted that checking “kind of keeps me human". The doctor explained that he feels it is his duty to "peek inside" their "once-living world". He writes: It kind of keeps me human. Y... News has dropped of a well-known businessman who has successfully filed an injunction against a newspaper to prevent it from reporting allegations of sexual and racial abuse of staff members at his British companies. After an eight-month investigation into the ‘bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman’, The Telegraph was prevented from revealing details about the person in question thanks to a so called 'gag order'. Five employees of companies that the unnamed person owns, referred to only as 'ABC' in court documents, came forward with allegations of ‘discre... Nobody should ever have to celebrate their birthday alone, but that's sadly what happened to one unlucky boy in Tucson, Arizona. Six-year-old Teddy was hoping to spend his special day with 32 of his schoolmates at a Peter Piper Pizza restaurant, but not a single one turned up. His mother, Sil Mazzini, had already been told by a few parents that their children wouldn't be able to attend, but the sight of Teddy sitting by himself on a huge table is enough to break even the coldest of hearts. Mazzini sent the picture to local journalist Nick VinZant who asked the folks on Facebook to make Tedd... A five-year-old-boy was bullied for wearing red nail varnish, so his big brother and dad decided to paint their nails too. Aaron Gouveia’s son Sam likes wearing nail varnish and had been wearing it for a while, until one day in school when he was bullied for it. In tears, he came home and wanted to take it off, and that’s when his father talked to him about it. The former journalist, who has a Twitter account called Daddy Files, recalled the story on the social media platform. He began: "Sam is my middle child & he’s a terror. A 'boy’s boy' as so many (not me) would say. He’s rough and tumb... We haven't even seen the trailer or know anything about Avengers 4, but it's safe to assume one thing: Chris Evans will no longer be Captain America. A few weeks ago, the 37-year-old posted an emotional tweet hinting that his time as the super soldier had come to an end, following the conclusion of filming on the next Avengers movies. Officially wrapped on Avengers 4. It was an emotional day to say the least. Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor.

In the lead up to Halloween, Megyn Kelly had a segment on her 'Today' show on which she posed the following question: What’s wrong with blackface? During the segment, titled ‘Halloween Costume Crackdown', the NBC show host conversed with fellow journalist Jenna Bush Hager, NBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff and Melissa Rivers about donning blackface for Halloween. The entire panel was white. "What is racist?" Kelly quipped. When I was a kid, that [blackface] was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character. The rest of the panel attempted to softly explain why wearing blackface i... This is probably the most unlikely description of a suspect that you'll ever read, but a man barring a resemblance to 'Ross from Friends' is wanted by Blackpool Police. That's right a Ross Geller lookalike - or, should we say, David Schwimmer lookalike - is wanted in connection with a theft from a Blackpool-based restaurant on 20 September. Almost as soon as this CCTV picture was posted of the man, everyone began to notice his striking resemblance to the 51-year-old actor who starred in Friends between 1994 and 2004. that’s ross gellar, sir pic.twitter.com/xbahPYb4wh — 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚... Business and technology entrepreneur and Brexit supporter, Sir James Dyson, has confirmed that his forthcoming electric cars will be built in a new manufacturing facility. In a beautiful bit of irony, this factory won't be in Britain. It won't even be in Europe. It's being built in Singapore, a decision based on the Asian nation's geographical location to "high growth markets". Dyson, best known for their bag-less vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, has confirmed that the facility will be ready by 2020. Chief executive Jim Rowan said in a memo to staff: Dyson's growing automotive team is maki... Kendall Jenner’s latest Vogue cover has landed in her in the middle of a cultural appropriation row, prompting the magazine to apologise for styling her hair in an ‘afro’ way. The November 2018 issue of the fashion magazine shows the 22-year-old model in a cream and white patterned dress, with her hair styled in a big brushed-backwards way, reminiscent of the 1960s. Critics argue that a white model should not be modelling a black hairstyle.

The human brain is an incredible instrument – our most powerful organ. Being able to process information unlike other species has allowed us to build civilisations across the world and even take our first forays into space. But that doesn’t mean our brains are always on point. Regardless of how clever we are, we all get confused sometimes over things that seem easy. Optical illusions – such as “the dress” – are a perfect example of this. Another famous optical illusion, entitled “My Wife and My Mother-in-Law” can supposedly reveal how old a person is. In the photo, people can either see a y...

Another day, another misguided tweet from someone in the British media. Following the protests in London for a second referendum on the UK’s relationship with the European Union – supported by the Independent as part of its Final Say campaign – Twitter has been flooded with opinions on the biggest peaceful protest since the Iraq war marches. Presenter and columnist Adam Boulton has put his foot in it, with a tweet that many people interpreted as encouraging riots.

If you'd like to see the reality of how Donald Trump's poisonous politics are impacting people's day-to-day lives, then sadly you won't have to look too far. A woman was been groped on a Southwest Airlines flight from Houston to Albuquerque on Sunday by a man who reportedly invoked the fact that Donald Trump 'gropes' women as his defence. The woman, only described in the complaint as C.W, said she was asleep in her seat when she felt her 'clothes move', and a hand touching her from behind along the 'bra line'. Federal prosecutors say that the man was 49-year-old Bruce Michael Alexander fro... Far-right Tommy Robinson supporters couldn’t get any weirder, surely? Well, unfortunately for everyone with a working brain and a pair of ears, this assumption is false. On the heels of Robinson’s latest court battle, his supporters have written a song – to the tune of Leonard Cohen’s 'Hallelujah' – which celebrates Robinson. It was tweeted by Ezra Levant, a Canadian Robinson fan who associates closely with fellow anti-Islam and anti-immigrant cheerleader Katie Hopkins after she was fired from consecutive media platforms in the UK. Tommy Robinson fans: You are all Snowflake cucks Also Tommy... The Trump administration gets scarier by the day. And the president's latest admission is no less terrifying - he's nailed his colours to the mast and said that he's a 'nationalist'. Speaking to the packed out rally in Houston, Texas, ahead of the midterms and to support the Republican candidate Ted Cruz, he said: A globalist is a person who wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what, we can't have that. ... You know what I am? I’m a nationalist. Use that word. The crowd reportedly broke out into choruses of 'USA' in response. Nationalism h... Animal rights charity PETA are no stranger to fanning the flames of controversy to prove a point. The latest dispute to engulf the organisation relates to milk, the dairy industry and white supremacy - we bet that’s not how you expected that sentence to end. PETA tweeted a link to an article entitled “What does drinking milk have to do with white supremacy?” The link was accompanied by the quote “Cows’ milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists. One more reason to #DitchDairy”. Cows' milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists. One more reason to #DitchDairy. https://... Remembrance Day is nearly upon us, and millions of people across the country will be choosing to wear red poppies on their clothes as a symbol of respect for the military personnel who have sacrificed their lives in conflicts. The red remembrance poppy is an artificial flower that's been used since 1921 to commemorate those who died fighting in the war, and in the run up to Remembrance Day on 11 November, someone in Sailsbury has thought it's appropriate to create a Christmas tree out of them. Taking to Twitter, BBC Wiltshire posted a photograph of the tree, accompanied by the caption: Pop... It's sad isn't it, you know, when you can no longer be racist, homophobic, transphobic, or misogynist in public without being blasted by the 'PC police'? Well, the latest victim of this seems to be that 'sexist' advertising campaign for Yorkie, the chocolate bar, that stated "it's not for girls". Earlier this month, Kleenex announced that it would be changing the branding of its tissues from 'Mansize' to 'Extra Large' after a barrage of complaints that the branding was 'sexist'. Taking to Twitter to reveal the change, Kleenex tweeted: We recently made changes to our Mansize branding and wi... Another day, another disturbing video clip from Trump’s America. Hot off the heels of the Trump administration’s reported plans to legislate trans identities out of existence, his supporters are still as besotted with him as ever before. But a new clip, tweeted by a US journalist, displays the startling loyalty of Trump’s supporters. When a journalist asked MAGA hat-wearers at a Trump rally which topics they were excited to hear the president talk about, their answer was astonishing. They responded: It doesn’t matter what he says, we’ll support it. What do you want to hear Trump talk about?... Former Tory MP Stewart Jackson has provoked outrage after he called the stepfather of a sick child 'a pathetic cretin' on Twitter. The ex-Peterborough MP, and former chief of staff for David Davis while he was Brexit Secretary, was responding to a Twitter user who had posted a photograph of his ill stepson in a hospital bed, draped in the EU flag.

We've all been there - we're in a heated row with our partner, or they're making more and more demands on us, and we quite simply would love to just not respond to them and look the other way.

Although it is often unavoidable, the thought of using a public toilet is enough to give some people sleepless nights. For some people, one of the ways of getting around this potential exposure to god knows how many germs, is to line the seat with toilet paper. However, an expert has stated that doing this might not be the best idea as you could be putting yourself at risk to even more bacteria. You're probably asking 'How is this possible?' Surely paper can't possibly carry as many germs as a dirty toilet seat? Well, according to Dr Philip Tierno, the way toilet seats are designed means th... Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have a chequered past, to put it mildly. Now, the president has come up with a catchy new nickname for his one-time rival: 'Beautiful Ted'. Trump shared his new nickname for the Texas senator with reporters as he headed to Houston to support the Republican in his efforts of re-election in the midterms. Speaking to ABC News chief Jonathan Carl, he said: To me, he's not 'Lyin' Ted' anymore—he's 'Beautiful Ted '. He then added: I call him 'Texas Ted'.

Depending on your political viewpoint, Caitlyn Jenner’s politics is either her strong point or her weak spot. But either way, her political beliefs are complex to say the least. After supporting Donald Trump in the 2016 election, even after he called Mexicans “rapists”, mocked a disabled reporter and was heard bragging about touching women without their consent, it seems Jenner has finally hit her limit. On her reality show, Jenner even said she thought Trump would be good for women’s issues. But as the penny has started to drop, Jenner has changed her tone. She recently stated that Trump h...

They call it the 'Ignition Overpressure Protection and Sound Suppression water deluge system' and it shot the water 100 feet into the air. The goal of this release is to reduce the extreme amount of hear and energy that becomes generated by a rocket launch. Nasa said: The test is part of preparation for la... A white woman has been filmed racially abusing a family from Guatemala in a Virginia restaurant, demanding that they speak Spanish. The family who was visiting a relative in the state were approached by the unnamed woman in a branch of Andy's restaurant in Lovettsville, Virginia, where she demanded to see their passports. In a video, the woman can be seen shouting at the family and demanding that they stop speaking Spanish as it is 'disrespectful' to speak another language in the US. The family, who have asked to remain anonymous were quoted as saying by NBC Washington: She asked for passp... In financially uncertain times such as these, it always feels like the good guys are the ones who bare the brunt.

The miner of Bateau Bay received 20 stitches in his right bicep from what he suspects was a bronze whaler shark. However, the confrontation appears to have been started by Kenny, after he accidentally headbutted the animal. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, he said: I went...

The Trump administration is looking into a law that would effectively erase recognition of trans and nonbinary gender identities, according to the New York Times. The memo being circulated says the Department of Health and Human Services would make changes to Title XI definitions of gender, to only recognise male and female sex, ignoring any other identity. The effects of such a policy would be utterly devastating to over 1 million Americans as it would seek to eradicates the identities of those whom identify as transgender, while also strictly defining gender as 'unchangeable'. In response... This year has seen several US politicians confronted in public due to their association with the Trump administration. Both Sarah Sanders and Scott Pruitt have been accosted by members of the public and now we can add Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to that list.

The Trump administration is considering stripping transgender and nonbinary people of official recognition by defining gender as determined by genitalia at birth.

The law could impact the lives of 1.4 million transgender and nonbinary Americans as it effectively eradicates the identities of those whom id... There’s few things children love more than toys.

In an article, she explains how she got "fed up" of cleaning and re-arranging her children’s stuff, so she packed them all up and threw them away.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/hollywood-calls-gun-control-urges-181347307.html---split---Saturday’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the worst attack ever in the U.S. to target the Jewish community, has caused an outpouring of grief and rage among notable figures in entertainment. The shooter, identified as Robert D. Bowers, was reportedly shouting anti-Semitic slurs as he opened fire, killing 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two other people. Bowers surrendered to police after being injured by gunfire. The shooting came just one day after Cesar Sayoc was arrested for targeting Democratic political and entertainment figures with mail bombs, including Robert De Niro, the Obamas, and the Clintons. The mail bombs heightened partisan tensions in the lead-up to the Nov. 6 election. In addition to their condolences for the victims and their families, many people accused President Donald Trump of fueling the fire, and emphasized the need to vote. Some raised the question of how much Fox News is contributing to the current climate. Rob Reiner tweeted that he feared “more and more incidents of terrorists feeling emboldened.” As long as Trump takes no responsibility for his part in inciting violence, which he will never do, we will see more and more incidents of terrorists feeling emboldened by tacit permission.

Weather conditions were normal but the brand new aircraft had experienced a technical issue on its previou... A day after the shooting that left 11 dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue, friends and family members recalled the victims — professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. Officials released the names of all 11 victims during a news conference Sunday, all of them middle-aged or elderly. The victims of the synagogue attack included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. The oldest was 97. Five of the victims lived in Squirrel Hill and the rest were from other Pittsburgh neighbourhoods and communities surrounding the city. The names of the victims are: ... The 11 victims gunned down in the Tree of Life massacre have names like Fienberg. Gottfried. Rabinowitz. Rosenthal. They were Jewish worshippers killed on Saturday by a gunman who stormed the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighbourhood. Many of them lived in the largely Jewish enclave where Halloween trick-or-treaters visit homes with decorative Hebrew scrolls affixed to doorposts. And as thousands grieved the slain at a memorial on Sunday, the tragedy has reawakened dormant-but-never-forgotten concerns in the Jewish community: the prospect of a violent anti-Semitism ... Lenard Broadhead says biodegradeable materials used in his new Honda are so "eco-friendly," hungry squirrels find them irresistible. Broadhead, who lives in Ottawa, says the rodents have made a series of targeted strikes on his air-filters, motors and fuel injector wiring, with repair costs eating away about $1,000 of his savings. Now his new routine is to remote-start his vehicle from a safe distance and then watch the underside for escaping squirrels. "I'm paranoid about this, because it's freaking expensive," Broadhead said. Watch as Lenard Broadhead explains what squirrels have been doi... An obscure regulation targeting the international marine shipping industry could have a widespread impact on the economy, including the price of airline tickets and diesel at the pump. The change affects large ships, which use a low grade of fuel that's considered the bottom of the barrel because of its air pollution. The International Maritime Organization is introducing a sulphur limit rule for 2020, known as IMO 2020, which will decrease the amount of sulfur allowed in the fuel from 3.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent. In order to comply, many ships will likely switch to diesel, which could lea... At the Pakistani orphanage where he was abandoned at birth, little Imran packed his things and said goodbye to the children who weren't so lucky. At four years old, Imran believed he would finally have a family. "Say goodbye to me," he said. "My mom is coming to take me to Canada." That was two years ago. He never made it — all because of a controversial policy that's kept hopeful Canadians separated from children they had created a space for in their hearts and their homes. But after a year-long investigation by The Fifth Estate, that may change. The federal government says it will review ... In 2013, Justin Trudeau – then leader of the third-place party – admitted to having smoked cannabis about a half-dozen times. He was unapologetic. He noted that the most recent occasion was during a dinner party at his Montreal home — well after his election to Parliament. Two years later, he became prime minister. Not all Canadians have had the privilege of using cannabis without consequence. Today, more than 500,000 Canadians are encumbered with a criminal record for doing something that is now legal: possessing a small amount (30 grams or fewer) of cannabis. A criminal conviction has rea... A woman says she was targeted by thieves and then humiliated when she turned to her insurance company for help. Criminals cleared out her family's storage locker and when she tried to make a claim, her insurance adjuster told her to get out of his office because she was breastfeeding her newborn. Ashly Cosgrove says her one-month-old son was tucked under her headscarf while she was nursing. Her husband, Zahir Zuway, and one of their daughters — age five — was also in the room. "He told me I had to leave the room," Cosgrove said from her home in Calgary. "I objected. I was just really embarr... She thought when she left her abusive ex she would finally be safe. But that illusion was shattered the day she discovered someone had broken into her Winnipeg home and installed hidden cameras in her bedroom and living area. "For a few days, I just wanted to hide inside a cupboard and not come out. I felt so violated," the woman said. Because of a court-ordered publication ban, CBC News is not naming the people involved in the case. The woman discovered the first camera on a Friday afternoon last April, after spotting an electrical socket facing her bed she had never noticed before. "I was... The Boston Red Sox really are that great. David Price proved his post-season mettle, Steve Pearce homered twice and Boston beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 on Sunday to finish off a one-sided World Series in five games. A tormented franchise during decades of frustration and despair before ending an 86-year championship drought in 2004, the Red Sox have become baseball's team of the century with four titles in 15 seasons.

Far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election on Sunday, promising to clean up politics, shrink the state and crack down on crime, in a dramatic swing away from the left in the world's fourth-largest democracy.

Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right, seven-term congressman, won Brazil's presidential election Sunday, giving him a convincing mandate to radically alter politics in Latin America's most populous country. Critics at home and abroad have lambasted the former paratrooper for his homophobic, racist and misogynist statements and his support for Brazil's military dictatorship that ruled from 1964 to 1985. Supporters backed his pledge to crack down on crime and battle government corruption in South America's largest economy. For Canadian business, a Bolsonaro presidency could open new investment opportu... Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Thai owner of English Premier League club Leicester City, was one of five people killed after a helicopter crashed next to the stadium, the club said on Sunday. The 60-year-old retail entrepreneur's helicopter burst into flames shortly after taking off from the soccer field Saturday at the team's King Power stadium which is named after his duty-free chain. The club did not name the other four victims. Vichai bought Leicester for 39 million pounds ($50 million US) in 2010 when it was in the second-tier Championship and bankrolled the revival that peaked with the... Jewish communities and citizens across Canada gathered together over the weekend to commemorate the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and condemn what one rabbi described as "an outrageous act of evil." Vigils and rallies were organized in a number of Canadian cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Halifax and Vancouver. Montreal Rabbi Reuben Poupko, who is originally from Pittsburgh, said no Jewish community has been left untouched by the shooting that left 11 people dead and six injured.

As Maysoon al-Masri struck out for the Israeli border with Syria on a pitch-black night last summer, she struggled with second thoughts — and with the kind of homesick remorse that is impossible to shake. The former journalist and her husband slipped through the dark, ruined streets of Daraa in southwestern Syria toward a pre-arranged meeting point on the border, where — with the help of the Israeli military — they became exiles, travelling west in the hope of a new, peaceful life. "I was really upset. I didn't want to leave home," al-Masri told CBC News in an exclusive interview. "It was l... In the hours before his arrest, as federal authorities zeroed in and secretly accumulated evidence, Cesar Sayoc was in his element: spinning classic and Top 40 hits in a nightclub where he'd found work as a DJ. As he entertained patrons from a dimly lit booth overlooking a stage at the Ultra Gentlemen's Club, where Halloween decorations hung in anticipation of a costume party, he could not have known that U.S. investigators that very evening were capitalizing on his own mistakes to build a case against him. He almost certainly had no idea that lab technicians had linked DNA on two pipe bomb...

---split---6.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/pittsburgh-synagogue-alleged-mass-shooter-told-swat-officers/story?id=58803485---split---The man who allegedly gunned down 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue used three handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle in the 20-minute rampage and screamed to SWAT officers who wounded him in a shootout that he wanted "all Jews to die," authorities said on Sunday. Robert Gregory Bowers, the suspect in the latest mass shooting in America, allegedly acted alone in the Saturday morning massacre at the Tree of Life temple, bursting into Shabbat services with guns blazing and killing three women and eight men, while injuring six others, including four police officers, officials said. During a news conference Sunday morning, the names of the dead were released. They ranged in age from 54 to 97, and included two brothers, a married couple and a family physician. All the victims were from the Pittsburgh area. Dr. Karl Williams, the Allegheny County medical examiner, read the names of the victims: Joyce Fienberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69.   Also killed were brothers Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and David Rosenthal, 54; and Bernice Simon, 84, and her husband, Sylvan Simon, 86.   Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, remained in fair condition and under guard on Sunday in a Pittsburgh hospital. He is scheduled to make his first appearance in federal court at 1:30 p.m. on Monday.  Investigators said that minutes before carrying out the carnage, Bowers is believed to have posted his intent to commit the massacre on the social media platform Gab, which is popular with white supremacists and the alt-right. "Screw the optics, I'm going in," reads a post believed to have been made by Bowers moments before the first gunshots were fired inside the temple. Bowers was charged late Saturday night with 29 federal counts, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. "Each count is punishable by death," Scott Brady, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said at Sunday's news conference.   Bob Jones, the special agent in charge of the FBI Pittsburgh office, said Bowers allegedly used three Glock 357 handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle in the massacre. "All the weapons he brought into the facility were used," Jones said. Brady added that during the course of the deadly assault, "Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people." Jones said Bowers roamed the sprawling temple in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood to kill victims.  Three services were occurring simultaneously at the temple at the time of the rampage and Jones said bodies were found in three different locations of the synagogue. The first shots were fired about 9:45 a.m. and calls went out to emergency medical services at 9:54 a.m. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was officiating one of the services when the shooting broke out. He told ABC News on Sunday that for about 20 seconds he wasn't sure what was happening.   Myers immediately called 911 as another rabbi huddled with congregants in a cloakroom. He said he was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher being the "eyes and ears" for the police as they rushed to the scene.  Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers describes the moment gunshots rang out inside Pittsburgh synagogue: "I remember everything crisply and will remember it the rest of my life." https://t.co/pIeIZOmsst pic.twitter.com/2iKIbaVAx1  Officers raced to the synagogue and encountered Bowers as he was exiting the building and a gun battle ensued, authorities said. Bowers retreated back into the temple and went to the third floor, according to the criminal complaint filed against him.     "SWAT operators entered the third floor of the building. While searching for any remaining victims SWAT operators encountered Bowers, who opened fire on the officers," according to the complaint. During the gunfight, two officers were shot multiple times by Bowers. Two other officers were injured by flying glass or bullet fragments in the encounter, authorities said.   During the exchange of gunfire, Bowers was shot several times and taken into custody, according to the complaint. As Bowers was being treated at the scene, he blurted out a statement to SWAT Officer David Blahut, saying, "He wanted all Jews to die and also that they (Jews) were committing genocide to his people," according to the criminal complaint. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, according to Jones. Investigators suspect he acted alone, Jones said.   In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.   Some of the congregants were gathering for a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue which had not yet started when the massacre began to unfold. No children were among those injured, authorities said.  Five victims remained hospitalized Sunday evening, including two in critical condition, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He said the two in critical condition were a 40-year-old SWAT team member and a 70-year old man who is the chaplain at UPMC-Presbyterian. Dr. Leonard Weiss, assistant EMS medical director for the city of Pittsburgh, lives next door to the synagogue and told ABC News on Sunday that the gunfire woke him up. "I started hearing yelling. Then I realized it was very close by," Weiss said. "My first thoughts were to get safe. But I knew that my role with the city and my role in my job is to find out what's going on and respond." He said he called the emergency dispatch center to find out where the staging area was, then alerted his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center of the alarming situation. "Then I dressed up. I got as much equipment as I could together, and put my boots on and I went outside," Weiss said. "I immediately was suspicious when I heard the gunfire that there would be several casualties. It took a long time for the scene to get safe and for us to get a specific count on who was injured." He said police officers escorted him to the staging area, where he helped direct ambulances to the scene and paramedics to the scene. He recalled checking on one victim with a bullet wound who was being rushed to the hospital in bad shape. He said that once the gunfire subsided and the wounded had been removed from the synagogue, he went to the threshold of the temple and looked in. "I saw several damaged windows. I could see a lot of upsetting things in the chapel that was beyond that threshold," he said. "I was able to visualize some of the victims who lost their lives.   "I felt very emotional," he said. "I felt scared for myself and for my family and my neighbors. I felt scared for my city that it could happen here. And, [I] felt especially proud and worried about my colleague paramedics that risked their lives to go right in and pull people out while the action was unfolding." He said it wasn't until Sunday morning that he heard one of the victims killed was Rabinowitz, a family physician and colleague at the UPMC Shadyside Hospital.  Kim and Ken Hardin, who live across the street from the synagogue, said they heard the shots and quickly ushered their children and a friend of theirs into the basement and away from windows. "We heard five repetitive shots. I stepped out on my porch and I heard three additional shots and within minutes police started to arrive," Ken Hardin told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Sunday. "Police started to park in front of our house. They were shielding themselves with their car. So we realized the situation was pretty serious." He said five officers knocked on his back door and asked to use their second floor to position snipers. "The five police officers went upstairs, asked that I open the windows in our bedroom and obtain a chest-high dresser," Ken Hardin said. "So I found one in my son's room. A police officer and I took the drawers out and dragged the dresser right in front of the window and they perched their rifles on top of the dresser toward the synagogue." Kim Hardin added: "We did see shooting taking place. Our youngest son said that he saw a police officer get shot. I don't know whether or not that he did. It was certainly traumatic for a 10-year-old to see police with so many weapons and to hear the gunfire."  The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement.   First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, Brady said. "They are truly heroes, who without hesitation, without concern for their safety ran toward gunfire to protect innocent victims. By confronting and neutralizing Bowers, they prevented additional loss of life," Brady said. The shooting rattled nerves across the country and globe and prompted an outpouring of support and condolences. In New York, the Empire State Building went dark except for an orange halo on the mast to honor the victims. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower also went dark in homage to the victims. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the city of Pittsburgh will stand by the victims' families and help them get through the tragedy. "Pittsburgh is a strong town. We are a resilient city," Peduto said at Sunday's news conference. "We'll get through this darkest day in Pittsburgh's history by working together."

---split---6.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/start-here-synagogue-shooting-online-hate-suspected-mail-bomber/story?id=58767053---split---It's Monday, Oct. 29, 2018. Thanks for choosing to start here.   1. Pittsburgh reeling after synagogue shooting kills 11 Pittsburgh and the Jewish community are in mourning after 11 people were killed when a gunman opened fire inside a synagogue in Squirrel Hill. It's the deadliest attack on American Jews in U.S. history. Members of three congregations were inside the Tree of Life temple where a baby-naming ceremony was about to get underway. Among the victims of the shooting were a 97-year-old woman, a married couple in their 80s, and two brothers in their 50s. Police said the alleged attacker, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, was ranting during a gun battle with officers, "They're committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews." ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman tells us about his conversation with a rabbi who was there when the shooting began: "He saw the gunman, heard the gunfire, but his brain couldn't assimilate what was actually going on. And then after about 20 seconds, he said he understood they are under attack."   2. Pittsburgh massacre highlights rise in hate online Investigators said it's believed that shooting suspect Robert Bowers wrote on Gab, a social media platform popular with white supremacists and the alt-right, just moments before the synagogue massacre: "Screw the optics, I’m going in." Gab is among alternative media platforms that offer "fringe media figures censorship-free spaces," according to Benjamin Decker, a research fellow at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. As authorities investigate Bowers' social media presence and whether he announced his intentions online, we look at the advancement of social media and the spread of online hate speech. ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz compares it to the rise of ISIS and how the terrorist group was able to take advantage of internet-based rage, hate and recruitment. John Cohen, former acting undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security and an ABC News contributor, tells us that groups like ISIS and neo-Nazis are using social media to "inspire disaffected people" to commit attacks: "They turn to social media to express their ideas. They will often say things on social media ... that as we look back in retrospect foretold of the upcoming attack."   3. Suspect tied to mail bombs to appear in court Cesar Sayoc, who's accused of mailing 14 pipe bombs to top Democrats and Trump critics, is expected to make his first court appearance today in Miami after he was arrested on Friday. Sayoc, 56, was charged with five federal crimes, including interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives and threats against former presidents. He faces up to 48 years in prison if convicted. Investigators believe the suspect built the devices in his white van, which was covered in stickers and decals with political messages, according to two officials briefed on the probe. The officials said a printer, stamps, paper, an unidentified powder and soldering equipment were found inside. ABC News Mark Remillard is in Miami and breaks down the case. 4. Trump's response to the week of violence President Donald Trump condemned the Pittsburgh shooting this weekend as "pure evil" and a "wicked act of mass murder." At a rally in southern Illinois on Saturday, he told supporters, "If you don't mind, I'm going to tone it down just a little bit." He shifted between using solemn words about the attack and Trump rally classics, like targeting Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, an intended victim of last week's mail bomb plot that included Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN. "Even as he's going after the same old targets, he has, I believe, toned it down a bit," ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl tells us. "The question is, what does he do now?" Elsewhere: 'The base by which we calculate unemployment for black men is skewed': Here's what the president gets wrong about black unemployment. 'It's going to be a long slog': If Democrats take back the House in the midterms, a battle to reveal Trump's tax returns looms. 'We can confirm that one of our flights has lost contact': An Indonesian passenger jet with 189 aboard crashed in the ocean shortly after takeoff. 'The president said that?': The president talks about the World Series, which Boston won on Sunday. From our partners at FiveThirtyEight: The Red Sox Win The World Series Last 'Nightline': How the mail bombing suspect was tracked down: Since Cesar Sayoc was arrested on Friday, officials have confirmed that at least 14 bombs have been found.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/us/loved-ones-remember-legacies-of-synagogue-shooting-victims---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. This undated photo provided by Barry Werber shows Melvin Wax. Wax was killed when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Courtesy of Barry Werber via AP) PITTSBURGH – They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. A day after the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead, officials released the names of the victims. The oldest of them was 97. The youngest was 54. They included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. Said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation: "The loss is incalculable." CECIL AND DAVID ROSENTHAL: 'SWEET, GENTLE, CARING MEN' Cecil and David Rosenthal went through life together with help from a disability-services organization. And an important part of the brothers' lives was the Tree of Life Synagogue, where they never missed a Saturday service, people who knew them say. "If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be," Chris Schopf, a vice president of the organization ACHIEVA, said in a statement. Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday's deadly shooting. They lived semi-independently. Cecil was a person who was up for all sorts of activities: a concert, lunch at Eat 'n Park — a regional restaurant chain known for its smiley-face cookies — even a trip to the Duquesne University dining hall, recalls David DeFelice, a Duquesne senior who was paired with him in a buddies program three years ago. The two became friends, DeFelice said. "He was a very gregarious person — loved being social, loved people. ... You could put him any situation, and he'd make it work," chatting about the weather or asking students about their parents and talking about his own, said DeFelice. And when DeFelice recognized Hebrew letters on Cecil's calendar, the elder man was delighted to learn that his buddy was also Jewish and soon invited him to Tree of Life. DeFelice joined him on a couple of occasions and could see that Cecil cherished his faith and the sense of community he found at temple. "He was such a strong practitioner of his faith," DeFelice said. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil, who according to his obituary was known as "the honorary mayor of Squirrel Hill," and David, who worked at Goodwill Industries. "They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated," he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with "such a gentle spirit." "Together, they looked out for each other," she said. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." The two left an impression on state Rep. Dan Frankel, who sometimes attends services at Tree of Life and whose chief of staff is the Rosenthals' sister. "They were very sweet, gentle, caring men," Frankel said. "... I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people." BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON: HELPING OTHERS AS A TEAM Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbor Jo Stepaniak says, and "they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness." "Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team," she said. The Simons, who were among those massacred Saturday, were fixtures in in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She'd served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighborhood, with the couple's dog in years past. Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor — the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi emeritus, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. And both Simons cared deeply about Tree of Life Synagogue. "(They) were very devoted, an active, steady presence," Berkun said. The Simons had married there in a candlelight ceremony nearly 62 years earlier, according to the Tribune-Review. Tragedy has struck their family before: One of the couple's sons died in a 2010 motorcycle accident in California. And now the Simons' deaths are reverberating through their family and community. "Bernice and Sylvan were very good, good-hearted, upstanding, honest, gracious, generous people. They were very dignified and compassionate," Stepaniak said, her voice breaking. "Best neighbors that you could ask for." MELVIN WAX: 'A SWEET, SWEET GUY' Melvin Wax was always the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire a few minutes after Sabbath services began. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, said Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He was a gem. He was a gentleman," recalled fellow congregant Barry Werber on Sunday. "There was always a smile on his face." Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said "Mel," a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous and a pillar of the congregation. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person," said Snider, a retired pharmacist and chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. "I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them," she said. Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday's services. "He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me," Snider said. "Just a sweet, sweet guy." JERRY RABINOWITZ: 'TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER' Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. "He is one of the finest people I've ever met. We've been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that," Ciesielka said. "His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people." Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday's shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. "He was truly a trusted confidant and healer," he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. "Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best." Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its "kindest physicians." The hospital said in a statement that "the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss." "Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating," Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. Olivia Tucker's grandmother was treated for cancer by Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz. Tucker, who is transgender, also visited Rabinowitz for a checkup. "He's the only doctor who ever has made a misstep about my trans-ness, and followed it up with really insightful questions with the purpose of learning and growth," Tucker said. "I felt blessed to have had him." JOYCE FIENBERG: 'MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING' Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 75, who was among the victims in Saturday's shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being," she said. The research center's current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor's degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and "a certain elegance and dignity" to the center, Perfetti said. "One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting," even if they were brief, he said. "I was always impressed with her." Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: 'PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL' Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area's Hadassah chapter. "Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him," said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein, 71, was president of the Men's Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up "the religious heart" of the congregation, said Cohen, the congregation co-president. Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, "he was somebody that everybody liked," Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER'S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. "I feel a part of me died in that building," Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday's shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he regularly saw her at services. "Rose was really a fixture of the congregation," Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret "Peg" Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, "led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. "He died doing what he liked to do most," said Don Salvin, Gottfried's brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: 'NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD' A neighbor in Pittsburgh's Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as "a really nice guy." Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. "I'm scared for my kids' future," Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. "How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?" Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she's lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a "wonderful" father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner "talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,' Prizner told the Tribune-Review. Beth Markovic, owner of Murray Avenue Kosher grocery and deli, said Younger was a dedicated customer who was especially fond of her meatloaf and chicken salad and asked her to alert him when she was making it. "So every time I make those things, I will certainly be thinking of him," Markovic said. "I have his phone number right in front of me where I do my work. . So, we feel it. We feel it very much." ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh. Associated Press journalists Allen G.

The government has begun the process of seeking the death penalty for the suspect accused of killing 11 worshippers during an anti-Semitic rampage on Sunday inside the Tree of Life synagogue, a report said. Thousands crowded into Soldiers & Sailors auditorium hall, pouring into the streets and huddled together in the rain for a candlelight vigil. The teary-eyed crowd spoke of resilience, healing, and gun control the day after a mass shooting claimed the lives of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue. The man accused of storming a Pittsburgh synagogue and killing 11 worshippers during an anti-Semitic rampage was described Sunday by neighbors as a loner who listened to talk radio, chain-smoked and was so bland in person that he bordered on being “forgettable.” The deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday prompted one man to create a special twist on the Pittsburgh Steelers logo. The suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue repeatedly expressed anti-Semitic views as he traded gunfire with responding officers, at one point flatly stating: "I just want to kill Jews," according to a federal affidavit made public Sunday. Pittsburgh's professional sports franchises honored the victims of Saturday's deadly mass shooting at a synagogue with a moment of silence and plans for a blood drive and donation collection. The victims of the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh included a grandfather, husband and wife, and two brothers, officials and family members revealed as new details about the alleged gunman behind the deadly rampage were released Sunday. A ninth death has taken place at a pediatric rehabilitation center in New Jersey due to an outbreak of a respiratory virus, officials announced Sunday. Multiple people have been killed, six others injured including four officers and a suspect is in custody following a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday. The alleged gunman in Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue spewed anti-Semitic posts on a social media platform popular with far-right extremists where he claimed that “Jews were the enemy of white people."

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-of-life-synagogue-shooter-pittsburgh_us_5bd475ffe4b055bc948c6ef2---split---Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges on Saturday evening against the man suspected of fatally shooting at least 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, allegedly opened fire Saturday morning at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters late Saturday afternoon that no children died in the shooting. Six people were reportedly injured, four of them police officers. A news conference to discuss the charges is scheduled for Sunday morning, The Associated Press reported.﻿ Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said he believed the suspect was wielding an “assault rifle” and also had at least three handguns with him. “This is the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” he said. Hissrich made similar comments at an earlier press conference that day. “It’s a very horrific crime scene,” Hissrich said at an earlier press conference. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve seen some plane crashes. It’s very bad.” Law enforcement responded to reports of an active shooter at the synagogue, which was crowded for Saturday services in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, shortly before 10 a.m. Police sources told KDKA that a gunman walked into the synagogue and yelled, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice plans to charge the suspect with hate crimes, along with other criminal charges. Congregation member Zachary Weiss, 26, told HuffPost that his father, Stephen Weiss, had been filling in on Saturday for a sick rabbi. “Anytime a congregant passes away you lose a friend,” said Weiss, noting that his father was unharmed. “The city is coming together and right now that is all we can do.” Multiple victims were being treated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, spokeswoman Amy Charley said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. “At this time, UPMC Presbyterian is treating four patients from the Tree of Life synagogue shooting,” she said. “Three victims are in surgery and one other is stable, awaiting surgery. Another patient at UPMC Presbyterian was treated and released. UPMC Mercy is treating a patient who is currently in surgery.” Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh told WHNT that he estimated between 60 and 100 people were inside the building when the shooting occurred. The synagogue had a Torah study and Shabbat services scheduled for Saturday, and a bris ― a Jewish ceremony in which an infant boy is circumcised ― was reportedly also taking place. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way,” Wolf said. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” The Tree of Life Congregation, founded more than 150 years ago, merged with Or L’Simcha in 2010 to form Tree of Life Or L’Simcha, according to its website. The synagogue describes itself as a Conservative Jewish congregation ― “Conservative” referring to a denomination of Judaism unrelated to political leanings. The site states that the synagogue is “true to traditional teachings while being “progressive and relevant to the way we live today.” Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun, who was not in the building at the time, told ABC News that the Squirrel Hill neighborhood hosts a number of other synagogues, along with Jewish gift shops and bookstores and kosher bakeries. “Absolutely no crime, it’s an amazing neighborhood, it’s hard to believe it’s a city neighborhood,” he said. NEW: Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun says there is "absolutely no crime" in the neighborhood where a shooting took place at his synagogue: "It's an amazing neighborhood. It's hard to believe it's a city neighborhood." https://t.co/TJJ3BEA0kS pic.twitter.com/AP1dgQVOCW The shooting took place on International Religious Freedom Day, the day that commemorates former President Bill Clinton signing the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act, which aimed to promote religious freedom through U.S. foreign policy. Both New York City and Los Angeles confirmed that they were increasing security measures as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. The New York Police Department told HuffPost it would be “deploying heavy weapons teams” at “houses of worship” across the city as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted that the LAPD would also be stepping up security. HuffPost reporter Saba Hamedy contributed to this report. This story has been updated.
---split---6.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-gather-vigil-pittsburgh-synagogue-023059353.html---split---Thousands of people gathered in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday night to mourn the 11 people killed and several others injured after a man opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue that morning. To pay tribute to the lives that were lost, the mourners crowded the streets in the neighborhood, holding candles, singing songs and pleading silently with signs to end the hate and violence. While the Squirrel Hill neighborhood has attracted a diverse range of residents in recent years, it remains a historic hub for Pittsburgh’s Jewish population. Drew Barkley, the executive director of the nearby synagogue Temple Sinai, told Time magazine on Saturday that the community is tight-knit. “The sad part is that people are waiting to find out who the dead are because it’s such a close-knit community there’s like one degree of separation and chances are everyone will know at least one person who died,” Barkley said. An unbelievable sea of people now at Murray and Forbes. Lighting candles and singing @WPXIpic.twitter.com/CuLt8cvsii Students from the nearby Taylor Allderdice High School organized the candlelight vigil, which began inside the Sixth Presbyterian Church before moving to the streets, in the hours after the shooting. More than 3,000 people attended the event to show their support, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “This was a very emotional, beautiful vigil, so proud of our community, our hearts are broken from this senseless, senseless hate crime against the Jewish community,” Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle (D), who was in attendance, said, according to CBS Pittsburgh. “To see these young students say what they had to say and to show that strength and the sense of community that exists here, that this is not something that we’re going to let break us, was really inspiring,” he continued. Allderdice High School is less than one and a half miles from where the massacre took place. Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in an apparently anti-Semitic attack, leaving nearly a dozen people dead and injuring six others. The synagogue was reportedly crowded at the time of the shooting, with at least three services and events scheduled for the day. Officials said Bowers, who reportedly had an “assault rifle” and at least three handguns, announced his presence to the congregation by shouting, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. He was later arrested after exchanging fire with police officers. The shooting is considered one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish people in recent U.S. history.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vigil-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting_us_5bd4fa7be4b0a8f17ef8637a---split---Thousands of people gathered in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday night to mourn the 11 people killed and several others injured after a man opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue that morning. To pay tribute to the lives that were lost, the mourners crowded the streets in the neighborhood, holding candles, singing songs and pleading silently with signs to end the hate and violence. While the Squirrel Hill neighborhood has attracted a diverse range of residents in recent years, it remains a historic hub for Pittsburgh’s Jewish population. Drew Barkley, the executive director of the nearby synagogue Temple Sinai, told Time magazine on Saturday that the community is tight-knit. “The sad part is that people are waiting to find out who the dead are because it’s such a close-knit community there’s like one degree of separation and chances are everyone will know at least one person who died,” Barkley said. An unbelievable sea of people now at Murray and Forbes. Lighting candles and singing @WPXI pic.twitter.com/CuLt8cvsii Students from the nearby Taylor Allderdice High School organized the candlelight vigil, which began inside the Sixth Presbyterian Church before moving to the streets, in the hours after the shooting. More than 3,000 people attended the event to show their support, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “This was a very emotional, beautiful vigil, so proud of our community, our hearts are broken from this senseless, senseless hate crime against the Jewish community,” Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle (D), who was in attendance, said, according to CBS Pittsburgh. “To see these young students say what they had to say and to show that strength and the sense of community that exists here, that this is not something that we’re going to let break us, was really inspiring,” he continued. Allderdice High School is less than one and a half miles from where the massacre took place. Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in an apparently anti-Semitic attack, leaving nearly a dozen people dead and injuring six others. The synagogue was reportedly crowded at the time of the shooting, with at least three services and events scheduled for the day. Officials said Bowers, who reportedly had an “assault rifle” and at least three handguns, announced his presence to the congregation by shouting, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. He was later arrested after exchanging fire with police officers. The shooting is considered one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish people in recent U.S. history.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-synagogue-reax-20181027-story.html---split---After word spread about the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, Rabbi Sarah Bassin of Beverly Hills quickly changed her planned sermon. Eleven people were killed and six injured in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the hub of the Jewish community, police said. Four police officers were among the wounded. The suspected gunman was arrested at the scene and identified as Robert Bowers, 46, authorities said. He has a history of making anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant social media posts. Bassin found a July blog post written by Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers about gun violence, titled “We deserve better.” In the post, Myers lamented that tragic events lead to thoughts and prayers by elected officials but little else before the nation’s collective conscience moves on. “Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the mid-term elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume,” he said. Bassin read the post to her congregation at Temple Emanuel. “It’s an innate cycle of these mass shootings — they are devastating and soul killing each time, and then they fade from memory,” she said after Saturday’s service. “I can’t imagine that he thought it would actually come to his community.” Temple Emanuel senior Rabbi Jonathan Aaron sent an email to congregants saying that Beverly Hills police had increased patrols in the neighborhood, just as Los Angeles police and sheriff’s departments also stepped up patrols around places of worship throughout the region. “Our synagogue is being watched closely, and we have taken measures to bolster our security,” he said. “We are on high alert in the synagogue and are prepared to protect ourselves from anyone that would do us harm.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted a similar message of caution, saying he had reached out to Jewish community leaders. “We mourn with #TreeOfLife community today,” he said. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors are investigating the killings as a hate crime and could seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter. The gunman, who was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, yelled, “All Jews must die!” as he walked into the synagogue, police told local television reporters. The shooting, which began shortly before 10 a.m. Eastern time, was likely “the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,” according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century. Amanda Susskind, Los Angeles regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said anti-Semitic incidents were up by 57% nationwide in 2016-17. Susskind recalled the 1999 shooting at a Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills by a self-professed white supremacist. Armed with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and wounded five people — including three children ages 5 and 6 — before he left the center and killed a mail carrier in Chatsworth. Furrow is serving a life sentence. Fortunately, Susskind said, there have been no similar incidences in the Los Angeles area since. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, President Trump suggested that if the Pittsburgh synagogue had armed security, “maybe it could have been a very much different situation." Susskind said security can be helpful but isn’t the only way to protect places of worship from harm. "Frankly, if someone is coming in with guns blazing, it’s hard to say whether that would make a difference,” she said. “Synagogues struggle with balancing wanting to be open to the community and protecting congregants. It's a tough, conflicting thing.” In Pico-Robertson, one of L.A.’s prominent Jewish communities, Stefani Sherwin, 69, said she was devastated to learn about the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, especially after the spate of suspicious, potentially explosive devices sent in recent days to prominent critics or political rivals of Trump. The targets included former President Obama and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “At some point I believe we get desensitized to it,” Sherwin said. “I don’t cry about it anymore — it’s almost expected.” Even so, Sherwin, who grew up in Pico-Robertson and now lives in the Pacific Palisades, said she feels scared about the increase in xenophobia that she’s noticed since Trump took office. “I don’t think I look Jewish, so maybe that serves me,” she said. “But I think the Jewish community is always looking over their shoulders.” Bassin, of Temple Emanuel, said she hopes to see an increased focus within the Jewish community on gun reform that can outlast the news cycle. “We all know that thoughts and prayers alone are insufficient,” she said. The Interfaith Solidarity Network, a group of L.A.-area interfaith leaders, issued a statement Saturday calling on faith leaders across the country to step up efforts of unity and tolerance. “The ISN condemns the shooting as a xenophobic act of violence stemming from ongoing national divisive rhetoric and policies, and stands in solidarity with the victims of this heinous and racist act,” the organization said. The ISN plans to hold an Interfaith Solidarity March on Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. The milelong walk will begin at Temple Aliyah, 6025 Valley Circle Blvd., in Woodland Hills.
---split---6.0---split---https://www.thedailybeast.com/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooter-spewed-his-hate-on-gab-the-alt-rights-favorite-social-network---split---Gab has marketed itself as a home for extremists kicked off of other social-media platforms. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has put new pressure on Gab, the niche social network where alleged shooter Robert Bowers and countless other white supremacists have been able to network and post their hate-filled messages. Bowers was an active Gab user, even posting what appeared to be an announcement of the attack shortly before he allegedly shot and killed 11 people, and wounded at least six others, at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Gab celebrated the attention it received after Bowers’ posts were found, claiming it was receiving a million hits per hour following the shooting. But the shooting could also isolate Gab from the tech companies still willing to do business with it. In the aftermath of the shooting, Paypal kicked Gab off of its payment platform, a Paypal spokesperson confirmed to The Daily Beast. And late Saturday night, Gab tweeted that its new hosting provider, Joyent, had pulled its services. "Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this. Working on solutions," it noted, adding in another tweet, "Big tech cannot stop us. The mainstream media cannot stop us." In a statement on the shooting, Gab said it “condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” Bowers’ account is no longer available, but Gab said it saved a backup of the posts for law enforcement. Bowers’ posts on Gab were replete with anti-Semitic slurs and calls for violence against Jews, who he claimed were behind plots to attack white Americans. But those kinds of posts aren’t out of the ordinary on Gab, which has become a hub for racist and anti-Semitic activity on the internet even as more prominent social networks crack down on extremist content. Founded by Andrew Torba—a Trump supporter who was once kicked out of the prestigious Silicon Valley tech accelerator Y Combinator’s alumni network for calling his colleagues “cucks”—Gab has built catering to right-wing extremists into its business model. The site even has a frog logo that echoes the alt-right favorite “Pepe the Frog,” and new users start with a profile picture cribbed from the “NPC meme” popular on far-right sites like 4Chan. In a March SEC filing, the company claimed to be positioning itself as a home for “conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users.” “As mainstream social networks continue to crack down on ‘objectionable content’ and censor conservative views, we believe the need for alternative platforms will only continue to rise,” the filing reads. Gab’s business plan has often meant hosting posts from some of the vilest characters in American politics. White supremacist Chris Cantwell, the infamous “crying Nazi” from the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, is on Gab. So is neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the white-supremacist Daily Stormer website. Gab was also the back-up social network for white supremacist and former Paul Ryan primary challenger Paul Nehlen after he was banned from Twitter. Even Gab eventually banned Nehlen—not over his attacks on Jews, but because he had posted personal information about a rival alt-right personality. Gab’s supposed commitment to free speech has frequently led to clashes with tech companies whose services it needs to use to keep the site running. In August, Microsoft threatened to pull its cloud-computing services from Gab over posts in which neo-Nazi Patrick Little said he would destroy Holocaust memorials and said Jews should be raised as “livestock.” While Torba likes to position Gab as a rival to Twitter and often taunts Twitter with posts on Gab’s own Twitter account, Gab is nowhere near the usership levels of Twitter or other major social media networks. While Twitter has more than 300 million active users, Gab reported having slightly less than 400,000 users as of March. Bowers’ posts on Gab show that he regularly interacted with other Gab members. He taunted believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, several of whom have fled to Gab after being kicked off of sites like Reddit. He reposted a Holocaust denial meme from “Pol News Network,” whose more than 23,000 followers make it one of the largest accounts on Gab. In the aftermath of the shooting, Bowers’ fellow Gab users reacted with praise for the shooter, hatred towards Jews, and fear that the massacre might finally prompt a crackdown on Gab. Got a tip?

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage---split---Advertisement Supported by By Campbell Robertson, Christopher Mele and Sabrina Tavernise PITTSBURGH — Armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and at least three handguns, a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said. In a rampage described as among the deadliest against the Jewish community in the United States, the assailant stormed into the Tree of Life Congregation, where worshipers had gathered in separate rooms to celebrate their faith, and shot indiscriminately into the crowd, shattering what had otherwise been a peaceful morning. The assailant, identified by law enforcement officials as Robert D. Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door. According to the police, Mr. Bowers exchanged gunfire with officers before retreating back inside and barricading himself inside a third-floor room. He eventually surrendered. Mr. Bowers, 46, was injured by gunfire, although the authorities said it was unclear whether those wounds were self-inflicted or whether the police had shot him. He was in stable condition Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Federal officials charged Mr. Bowers with 29 criminal counts. They included obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs — a hate crime — and using a firearm to commit murder. He also faces state charges, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The authorities said that he had no previous criminal history. [Read more about the shooting suspect, who frequently reposted anti-Semitic content on social media.] Though a bris, a ceremony to mark a child’s birth, was among the ceremonies taking place Saturday, no children were among the casualties, law enforcement officials said. The wounded included a 70-year-old man who had been shot in the torso, and a 61-year-old woman with soft tissue wounds, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The attack Saturday morning struck the heart of the city’s vibrant Jewish community, in the leafy Squirrel Hill neighborhood that is home to several synagogues, kosher restaurants and bakeries. Hours later, hundreds gathered at three separate interfaith vigils on a cold, rainy evening to mourn the dead and pray for the wounded. The assault on the synagogue unfolded on a quiet, drizzly morning, and came amid a bitter, vitriolic midterm election season and against the backdrop of what appears to be a surge in hate-related speech and crimes across America. It also took place in the wake of the arrest Friday morning of a man who the authorities said sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to critics of Mr. Trump, including several high-profile Democrats. Calling it the “most horrific crime scene” he had seen in 22 years with the F.B.I., Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a “peaceful service” when congregants were gunned down and “brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith.” “We simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American life,” said Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, speaking at a news conference Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh. “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Pennsylvanians and are not who we are as Americans.” The anguish of Saturday’s massacre heightened a sense of national unease over increasingly hostile political rhetoric. Critics of President Trump have argued that he is partly to blame for recent acts of violence because he has been stirring the pot of nationalism, on Twitter and at his rallies, charges that Mr. Trump has denied. About Saturday’s attack, Mr. Trump, addressing reporters at Joint Base Andrews, said: “It’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done.” “The results are very devastating,” he said, adding that if the temple “had some kind of protection” then “it could have been a much different situation.” Later, speaking to reporters as he got off Air Force One in Illinois, Mr. Trump said he planned to visit Pittsburgh but he did not say when. Leaders in the United States and across the world condemned the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he was “heartbroken and appalled” and that the “the entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that criminal charges by the Justice Department “could lead to the death penalty.” “Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society,” Mr. Sessions said. “Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety.” The massacre Saturday was at least the third mass shooting in a house of worship in three years. Last November, a gunman killed 26 worshipers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine congregants in a church in Charleston, S.C. [From a Texas church to a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, houses of worship have become sites of mass shootings.] It came amid rising anxiety about illegal immigration and in a decade that has seen an uptick in hate crimes. According to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued earlier this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979. The attack also was a deep and painful blow to the Jewish community in the United States, and came just days after George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and major donor to Democratic candidates, who is Jewish and who survived Nazi occupation in Hungary, received a pipe bomb in the mail. Also in the past week, a Senate campaign sign for Josh Hawley, attorney general of Missouri, was sprayed with a swastika. On Saturday, the Tree of Life Congregation was holding services for three separate congregations when the gunman stormed in with an AR-15-style assault rifle, a Glock, and two other handguns, and began shooting. Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 a.m., Mr. Jones of the F.B.I. said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later. Mr. Bowers had already shot and killed 11 people and was on his way out of the synagogue, Mr. Jones said, when he encountered police officers and shot at them. He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr. Jones said. He was in the synagogue for about 20 minutes, law enforcement officials said. “By the time I got there they were already starting to extract people,” said Chief Scott Schubert of the Pittsburgh Police. “Watching those officers running into the dangers to remove people and get them to safety was unbelievable.” Residents near the synagogue were told to stay inside their homes. Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue. “They chased my wife inside,” he said. “They just said get in the house.” On Saturday night, the authorities were still piecing together a portrait of Mr. Bowers, and had searched his apartment with a robotic bomb detector and police dogs. His apartment is in a neighborhood dotted with mostly small to medium brick homes, about a 25-minute drive south of Pittsburgh in the suburb of Baldwin Borough. Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Pennsylvania’s 14th District, where the synagogue is, said that Mr. Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name. “I don’t think anybody really knows this guy, other than he was a hateful anti-Semite who had posted anti-Semitic views,” Mr. Doyle said. “We’re all kind of numb, kind of in shock, it’s not really something that happens much here.” A spokesman for the A.D.L. said that before Saturday’s shooting the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent United States history was in 1985, when a man killed a family of four in Seattle. He had mistakenly thought that they were Jewish. More recently, in 2014, a white supremacist opened fire outside a Jewish Community Center in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., killing three people. “I’m afraid to say that we may be at the beginning of what has happened to Europe, the consistent anti-Semitic attacks,” said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of Simon Wiesenthal Center, who prayed at Mr. Trump’s inauguration. He spoke in a phone interview from Austria, where he was visiting the Mauthausen concentration camp. “If it is not nipped in the bud,” he continued, “I am afraid the worst is yet to come.” Anti-Semitism appeared to run deep for Mr. Bowers. Before it was deleted Saturday morning, a social media account believed to belong to him was filled with anti-Jewish slurs and references to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. In January, an account under his name was created on Gab, a social network that bills itself as a free speech haven. The app, which grew out of claims of anti-conservative bias by Facebook and Twitter, is a popular gathering place for alt-right activists and white nationalists whose views are unwelcome on other social media platforms. Early members included the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website. Several weeks ago, Mr. Bowers’s account posted a link to the website of HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit organization, which was planning a shabbat ceremony for refugees in locations around the country. The caption read: “Why hello there HIAS! You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?” And hours before the gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue, the account posted again: “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” HIAS said in a statement on Saturday: “There are no words to express how devastated we are by the events in Pittsburgh this morning.” Shortly after Mr. Bowers was named the suspect in the shooting, Gab confirmed that the name on the account, which was verified, matched that of the suspect. The company archived the account before taking it offline, and released a statement saying it was cooperating with law enforcement. “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,” the statement read. The Tree of Life Congregation dates back to 1864, and was originally in downtown Pittsburgh, said Alvin K. Berkun, a former rabbi at Tree of Life and now rabbi emeritus, who stayed home from services on Saturday to tend to his sick wife. It moved to its current site in Squirrel Hill in 1952, where it now takes up most of a corner block. About 26 percent of the Pittsburgh area’s Jewish households are in Squirrel Hill, while another 31 percent of Jewish households are largely located in neighborhoods around there, Brandeis University researchers reported in a 2017 study. About 48 percent of Jewish children in greater Pittsburgh live in Squirrel Hill, according to the study, which was carried out on behalf of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. [Squirrel Hill has long been one of the most deeply rooted Jewish neighborhoods in America.] “Squirrel Hill is really an amazing safe community,” he said. It is the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh with kosher restaurants and bakeries and a Jewish Community Center. “I lived for a while in Israel and I know what security can mean, but the truth is the two safest neighborhoods I know are Squirrel Hill and Jerusalem. I’ve lived in both.” On the high holidays, when the sanctuary comes close to reaching its capacity of 1,450 congregants, there are security officers. But Saturday morning, he said, when there would be around 75 people, “everything would have been wide open.” In recent years, the congregation size had dwindled and so now three congregations meet on Saturday morning, in three different parts of the synagogue. “It’s a very vibrant place on Saturday mornings,” he said. Rabbi Berkun had heard that the gunman had barricaded himself at one point in his old study. Still, threats were something he had never really thought about, not here. As soon as he saw news of the shooting on social media, Zachary Weiss, 26, tried to get in touch with his father, Stephen Weiss, a longtime member of the Tree of Life Congregation. By that time the elder Mr. Weiss was already in action, carrying out the all-too-real protocols of the active shooter response training that congregants at Tree of Life had put into place the year before. Recounting what his father told him, the younger Mr. Weiss said that services had just been getting started when he heard a loud noise. “There was a loud sound and a couple of people investigating it heard a couple more loud sounds,” he said. “That’s when my father and the rabbi discovered it was the sound of gunshots.” The rabbi instructed everyone to get to a safe place, and after the Tree of Life congregants had done so, his father considered the other congregations that meet in the building on Saturdays. The bris was taking place on a lower floor, and he checked first to make sure the people there were safe. They were. His father never saw the shooter, Mr. Weiss said, but, before evacuating, he was at one point close enough to see the shell casings. “It’s going to take a long while for us as a community to grasp this,” he said.

Wax was killed when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Courtesy of Barry Werber via AP) PITTSBURGH (AP) -- They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors serving their local community. A day after the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead, officials released the names of the victims. The oldest of them was 97. The youngest was 54. They included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife. Said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation: "The loss is incalculable." CECIL AND DAVID ROSENTHAL: 'SWEET, GENTLE, CARING MEN' Cecil and David Rosenthal went through life together with help from a disability-services organization. And an important part of the brothers' lives was the Tree of Life Synagogue, where they never missed a Saturday service, people who knew them say. "If they were here, they would tell you that is where they were supposed to be," Chris Schopf, a vice president of the organization ACHIEVA, said in a statement. Achieva provides help with daily living, employment and other needs, and the organization had worked for years with Cecil, 59, and David, 54, who were among the 11 killed in Saturday's deadly shooting. They lived semi-independently. Cecil was a person who was up for all sorts of activities: a concert, lunch at Eat 'n Park — a regional restaurant chain known for its smiley-face cookies — even a trip to the Duquesne University dining hall, recalls David DeFelice, a Duquesne senior who was paired with him in a buddies program three years ago. The two became friends, DeFelice said. "He was a very gregarious person — loved being social, loved people. ... You could put him any situation, and he'd make it work," chatting about the weather or asking students about their parents and talking about his own, said DeFelice. And when DeFelice recognized Hebrew letters on Cecil's calendar, the elder man was delighted to learn that his buddy was also Jewish and soon invited him to Tree of Life. DeFelice joined him on a couple of occasions and could see that Cecil cherished his faith and the sense of community he found at temple. "He was such a strong practitioner of his faith," DeFelice said. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun saw that, too, in Cecil, who according to his obituary was known as "the honorary mayor of Squirrel Hill," and David, who worked at Goodwill Industries. "They really found a home at the synagogue, and people reciprocated," he said. Cecil carried a photo in his wallet of David, whom Schopf remembers as a man with "such a gentle spirit." "Together, they looked out for each other," she said. "Most of all, they were kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." The two left an impression on state Rep. Dan Frankel, who sometimes attends services at Tree of Life and whose chief of staff is the Rosenthals' sister. "They were very sweet, gentle, caring men," Frankel said. "... I know that this community will really mourn their loss because they were such special people." BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON: HELPING OTHERS AS A TEAM Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help other people, longtime friend and neighbor Jo Stepaniak says, and "they always did it with a smile and always did it with graciousness." "Anything that they could do, and they did it as a team," she said. The Simons, who were among those massacred Saturday, were fixtures in in the townhome community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where they had lived for decades. She'd served on the board, and he was a familiar face from his walks around the neighborhood, with the couple's dog in years past. Sylvan, 86, was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor — the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. (The rabbi emeritus, Alvin Berkun, quipped that Sylvan had to get better so he could once again lift the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture.) Bernice, 84, a former nurse, loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work, according to Stepaniak and neighbor Inez Miller. And both Simons cared deeply about Tree of Life Synagogue. "(They) were very devoted, an active, steady presence," Berkun said. The Simons had married there in a candlelight ceremony nearly 62 years earlier, according to the Tribune-Review. Tragedy has struck their family before: One of the couple's sons died in a 2010 motorcycle accident in California. And now the Simons' deaths are reverberating through their family and community. "Bernice and Sylvan were very good, good-hearted, upstanding, honest, gracious, generous people. They were very dignified and compassionate," Stepaniak said, her voice breaking. "Best neighbors that you could ask for." MELVIN WAX: 'A SWEET, SWEET GUY' Melvin Wax was always the first to arrive at New Light Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood — and the last to leave. Wax, who was in his late 80s, was among those killed when a gunman entered the synagogue Saturday and opened fire a few minutes after Sabbath services began. Fellow members of the congregation, which rented space in the lower level of the Tree of Life Synagogue, said Wax was a kind man and a pillar of the congregation, filling just about every role except cantor. "He was a gem. He was a gentleman," recalled fellow congregant Barry Werber on Sunday. "There was always a smile on his face." Myron Snider spoke late Saturday about his friend who would stay late to tell jokes with him. He said "Mel," a retired accountant, was unfailingly generous and a pillar of the congregation. "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything at the synagogue. He was really a very learned person," said Snider, a retired pharmacist and chairman of the congregation's cemetery committee. "He and I used to, at the end of services, try to tell a joke or two to each other. Most of the time they were clean jokes. Most of the time. I won't say all the time. But most of the time." New Light moved to the Tree of Life building about a year ago, when the congregation of about 100 mostly older members could no longer afford its own space, said administrative assistant Marilyn Honigsberg. She said Wax, who lost his wife Sandra in 2016, was always there when services began at 9:45 a.m. "I know a few of the people who are always there that early, and he is one of them," she said. Snider had just been released from a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and was not at Saturday's services. "He called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me," Snider said. "Just a sweet, sweet guy." JERRY RABINOWITZ: 'TRUSTED CONFIDANT, HEALER' Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and his partner in his medical practice were seemingly destined to spend their professional lives together. He and Dr. Kenneth Ciesielka had been friends for more than 30 years, since they lived on the same floor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ciesielka was a few years behind Rabinowitz, but whether by fate or design, the two always ended up together. They went to the same college, the same medical school and even had the same residency at UPMC a few years apart. "He is one of the finest people I've ever met. We've been in practice together for 30 years and friends longer than that," Ciesielka said. "His patients are going to miss him terribly. His family is going to miss him terribly and I am going to miss him. He was just one of the kindest, finest people." Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus remembered Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician and victim in Saturday's shooting, as more than a physician for him and his family for the last three decades. "He was truly a trusted confidant and healer," he wrote in an email to his former co-workers on Sunday. "Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz ... could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor. He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best." Rabinowitz, a family practitioner at UPMC Shadyside, was remembered by UPMC as one of its "kindest physicians." The hospital said in a statement that "the UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss." "Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith. His loss is devastating," Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, wrote in a statement on Twitter. Olivia Tucker's grandmother was treated for cancer by Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz. Tucker, who is transgender, also visited Rabinowitz for a checkup. "He's the only doctor who ever has made a misstep about my trans-ness, and followed it up with really insightful questions with the purpose of learning and growth," Tucker said. "I felt blessed to have had him." JOYCE FIENBERG: 'MAGNIFICENT, GENEROUS, CARING' Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg, 75, who was among the victims in Saturday's shooting, spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, retiring in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, said she is devastated by the death of her colleague and friend. "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being," she said. The research center's current director, Charles Perfetti, said Fienberg earned her bachelor's degree in social psychology from the University of Toronto, in her native Canada. She brought a keen mind, engaging personality and "a certain elegance and dignity" to the center, Perfetti said. "One could have elevated conversations with her that were very interesting," even if they were brief, he said. "I was always impressed with her." Stephen, who died in 2016 after a battle with cancer, was a renowned professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University. His work was used in shaping national policies in forensic science, education and criminal justice. The couple married in 1965 and had moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s. Joyce began her work at the center in 1983. The couple had two sons and several grandchildren. DANIEL STEIN: 'PASSIONATE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL' Daniel Stein was a visible member of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, where he was a leader in the New Light Congregation and his wife, Sharyn, is the membership vice president of the area's Hadassah chapter. "Their Judaism is very important to them, and to him," said chapter co-president Nancy Shuman. "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein, 71, was president of the Men's Club at Tree of Life. He also was among a corps of the New Light members who, along with Wax and Richard Gottfried, 65, made up "the religious heart" of the congregation, said Cohen, the congregation co-president. Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." With his generous spirit and dry sense of humor, "he was somebody that everybody liked," Halle said. ROSE MALLINGER: SHOOTER'S OLDEST VICTIM Former Tree of Life Rabbi Chuck Diamond said he worried about Rose Mallinger as soon as he heard about the deadly shooting at the synagogue. The 97-year-old had almost unfailingly attended services for decades, he told The Washington Post, and was among the first to walk in. "I feel a part of me died in that building," Diamond said. The oldest of those killed in Saturday's shooting at Tree of Life, Brian Schreiber told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he regularly saw her at services. "Rose was really a fixture of the congregation," Schreiber, president and CEO of the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, 61, was among the wounded, a family member said. She remains hospitalized. RICHARD GOTTFRIED: READYING FOR RETIREMENT Richard Gottfried was preparing for a new chapter in his life. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife and practice partner Margaret "Peg" Durachko Gottfried. He and his wife met at the University of Pittsburgh as dental students, according to the Washington Post, and opened their practice together in 1984. Gottfried, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not otherwise afford dental care, was preparing to retire in the next few months. He, along with Wax and Stein, "led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. "He died doing what he liked to do most," said Don Salvin, Gottfried's brother-in-law, told the Washington Post. IRVING YOUNGER: 'NEVER HAD AN UNKIND WORD' A neighbor in Pittsburgh's Mount Washington neighborhood on Sunday remembered victim Irving Younger as "a really nice guy." Jonathan Voye told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Younger, 69, was personable and occasionally spoke with him about family or the weather. "I'm scared for my kids' future," Mr. Voye told the Post-Gazette. "How can you have that much hate for your fellow neighbor?" Tina Prizner, who told the Tribune-Review she's lived next door to Younger for several years, said he was a "wonderful" father and grandfather. The one-time real estate company owner "talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody,' Prizner told the Tribune-Review. Beth Markovic, owner of Murray Avenue Kosher grocery and deli, said Younger was a dedicated customer who was especially fond of her meatloaf and chicken salad and asked her to alert him when she was making it. "So every time I make those things, I will certainly be thinking of him," Markovic said. "I have his phone number right in front of me where I do my work. . So, we feel it. We feel it very much." ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia, Peltz reported from New York and Dale reported from Pittsburgh. Associated Press journalists Allen G. Breed and Robert Bumsted in Pittsburgh and researcher Monika Mather in Washington contributed to this report.
---split---6.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/nine-killed-historic-emanuel-church-charleston-south-carolina-n377436---split---A gunman remained at large early Thursday after nine people were shot and killed in Charleston, South Carolina, during a Bible study session at one of the nation's oldest African-American churches, authorities said. "I do believe this was a hate crime," Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said early Thursday near the scene at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. At a 6 a.m. ET press conference, investigators released an image of the suspect and said he had left the church in a black four-door sedan. “Regardless of how small the people think that their information might be we want them to call us,” Mullen said. He called on the public to be “vigilant” but to not approach the suspect. The suspect was described as slender white male aged 21 to 25, who was about about 5ft 9in tall with a bowl cut. Police did not release the car's make but Mullen said it had a "very distinctive license plate." The victims included the church's pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, 41, a Democratic member of the state Senate, two sources told NBC News. Mullen said police were called on a report of a shooting at the church at 9:05 p.m., and when officers arrived there they found eight people dead and others injured. Two of the wounded were rushed to a hospital, and one of those victims later died, he said. Related: Massacre Church at Center of African-American Struggle "This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience. It is senseless," Mullen said. "It is unfathomable that somebody in today’s society would walk into a church, when people are having a prayer meeting, and take their lives." Police described the suspect as wearing a gray sweatshirt or hoodie, jeans and Timberland boots. Mullen characterized the gunman as "extremely dangerous." The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were among the law enforcement agencies assisting in the search for the gunman, Mullen said. "I can assure you that we are going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up, and to make sure that he does not to hurt anyone else,” Mullen said. Known as "Mother Emanuel," the church is the oldest AME church in the South, having been founded in 1816 under the leadership of abolitionist minister Morris Brown, the second bishop of the AME Church in the U.S. The Gothic Revival-style church is on the National Register of Historic Places.

It's horrible," Lisa Phipps, who works across the street as a caterer, told NBC News. "I just can't believe this is happening in my community," Phipps said. "That's a very active church. ... Their influence is wonderful. They do so much for the community. I can't imagine a human being doing something like this." Related: All You Need to Know About Hate in America Cornell William Brooks, the president and CEO of the NAACP, added: "There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture." The attack came two months after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, by a white police officer in neighboring North Charleston that sparked major protests and highlighted racial tensions in the area. The officer has been charged with murder, and the shooting prompted South Carolina lawmakers to push through a bill helping all police agencies in the state get body cameras. Pinckney was a sponsor of that bill. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who represents South Carolina, called the shooting a "senseless tragedy" and said he was making arrangements to return to the state from Washington, D.C., as soon as possible. "Tonight we stand together in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation at Emanuel AME, and for the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at the loss of their loved ones," Scott said. "We will come together as a city and as a state to lift up those who need us most right now." Mayor Joe Riley Jr. said that the gunman had to be a "hate-filled person." The Rev. Joseph Darby, a prominent pastor who knew Pinckney, told MSNBC that the shooting was "not surprising." He added: “This is the product of what happens when those who spout divisive and bigoted rhetoric speak to people who do not respond to words with thought but to words with action. This is the epitome of a hate crime ... This is sadly familiar, it is a shame that in the 21st century this happens.” Related: KKK Among 19 Hate Groups Operating in S.C. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who had been scheduled to campaign Thursday in Charleston, canceled the events "due to the tragic events unfolding in South Carolina tonight," his campaign said. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was in South Carolina campaigning earlier Wednesday but left the state before the shooting took place. "Heartbreaking news from Charleston — my thoughts and prayers are with you all," she said in a tweet. In a statement early Thursday, Gov. Nikki Haley asked everyone to "please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers." The Rev. Norvel Goff, presiding elder of the Edisto District of the state conference of the AME Church, said a prayer vigil would be held at noon Thursday. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-of-life-synagogue-shooter-pittsburgh_us_5bd475ffe4b055bc948c6ef2---split---Federal prosecutors filed 29 charges on Saturday evening against the man suspected of fatally shooting at least 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, allegedly opened fire Saturday morning at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters late Saturday afternoon that no children died in the shooting. Six people were reportedly injured, four of them police officers. A news conference to discuss the charges is scheduled for Sunday morning, The Associated Press reported.﻿ Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office, said he believed the suspect was wielding an “assault rifle” and also had at least three handguns with him. “This is the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” he said. Hissrich made similar comments at an earlier press conference that day. “It’s a very horrific crime scene,” Hissrich said at an earlier press conference. “It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen, and I’ve seen some plane crashes. It’s very bad.” Law enforcement responded to reports of an active shooter at the synagogue, which was crowded for Saturday services in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, shortly before 10 a.m. Police sources told KDKA that a gunman walked into the synagogue and yelled, “All Jews must die,” before opening fire. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice plans to charge the suspect with hate crimes, along with other criminal charges. Congregation member Zachary Weiss, 26, told HuffPost that his father, Stephen Weiss, had been filling in on Saturday for a sick rabbi. “Anytime a congregant passes away you lose a friend,” said Weiss, noting that his father was unharmed. “The city is coming together and right now that is all we can do.” Multiple victims were being treated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, spokeswoman Amy Charley said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. “At this time, UPMC Presbyterian is treating four patients from the Tree of Life synagogue shooting,” she said. “Three victims are in surgery and one other is stable, awaiting surgery. Another patient at UPMC Presbyterian was treated and released. UPMC Mercy is treating a patient who is currently in surgery.” Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh told WHNT that he estimated between 60 and 100 people were inside the building when the shooting occurred. The synagogue had a Torah study and Shabbat services scheduled for Saturday, and a bris ― a Jewish ceremony in which an infant boy is circumcised ― was reportedly also taking place. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way,” Wolf said. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” The Tree of Life Congregation, founded more than 150 years ago, merged with Or L’Simcha in 2010 to form Tree of Life Or L’Simcha, according to its website. The synagogue describes itself as a Conservative Jewish congregation ― “Conservative” referring to a denomination of Judaism unrelated to political leanings. The site states that the synagogue is “true to traditional teachings while being “progressive and relevant to the way we live today.” Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun, who was not in the building at the time, told ABC News that the Squirrel Hill neighborhood hosts a number of other synagogues, along with Jewish gift shops and bookstores and kosher bakeries. “Absolutely no crime, it’s an amazing neighborhood, it’s hard to believe it’s a city neighborhood,” he said. NEW: Rabbi Emeritus Alvin Berkun says there is "absolutely no crime" in the neighborhood where a shooting took place at his synagogue: "It's an amazing neighborhood. It's hard to believe it's a city neighborhood." https://t.co/TJJ3BEA0kS pic.twitter.com/AP1dgQVOCW The shooting took place on International Religious Freedom Day, the day that commemorates former President Bill Clinton signing the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act, which aimed to promote religious freedom through U.S. foreign policy. Both New York City and Los Angeles confirmed that they were increasing security measures as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. The New York Police Department told HuffPost it would be “deploying heavy weapons teams” at “houses of worship” across the city as a precaution in response to the Pittsburgh incident. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted that the LAPD would also be stepping up security. HuffPost reporter Saba Hamedy contributed to this report. This story has been updated.

Oklahoma City handed them a fifth straight loss, 117-110, in picking up their first win of the season. Turnovers once again destroyed Phoenix (1-5). The Suns committed 22 that led to 22 Thunder (1-4) points. “I don’t even know, I don’t even know,” said Suns rookie 7-footer Deandre Ayton when asked about why turnovers continue to plague them. Phoenix has allowed a staggering 129 points off 101 turnovers in this five-game skid. “I got two turnovers myself in the full-court set,” Ayton continued as he had three tota... SAN PEDRO TAPANATEPEC, Mexico – Social media has filled with speculation that the caravan of Central American migrants walking to the U.S. is funded by political organizations trying to influence the upcoming U.S. midterm elections one way or another. Volunteers with the bi-national group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which has stepped in to help coordinate the caravan after migrants crossed into Mexico from Guatemala, insist there isn’t a political agenda or hidden hand guiding the caravan. The migrants, many of whom are families traveling with children and babies and fleeing poverty and violence ... News of the mass killing at a synagogue in Pittsburgh was only a few hours old when President Donald Trump attempted to cut off any discussion about gun laws by, in essence, blaming the victims. He said our easy access to weapons had “little to do with it,” meaning the shooting, adding, “If they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation.” As if the only solution to our epidemic of mass murders is for every single one of us to be armed at all times or to be protected by armed guards. At all times. Okay, let’s not talk about guns t... A woman was killed in a Phoenix motel after she and her boyfriend were tied up after getting in an altercation with visitors Sunday morning. Police identified 29-year-old Tiffani Sellys as one of the victims. Sellys's body was found at a motel near the 2700 block of West Sweetwater Ave. after her boyfriend was able to free himself from his restraints and call for help, police said. The boyfriend, who was not identified, led responding officers back to the room shortly before 8 a.m. Sunday, where Sellys was pronounced dead, according to police. Phoenix police are looking for a male suspect, ... Aspiring agent Christian Dawkins wrote of a plan to pay UA standout Rawle Alkins and his family $50,000 while he played for Arizona last season, ESPN reported in a lengthy story posted Sunday night. The report also linked Dawkins to UA coach Sean Miller via phone records.

Thirteen of those calls lasted five minutes or longer. Michael Schachter, the defense attorney for Adidas executive Jame... A day after one of the deadliest attacks against Jewish people in U.S. history, a Phoenix-based Jewish organization brought together dozens of faith members for a prayer ceremony in solidarity with the 11 killed and six injured in Pittsburgh. As people filed into the Chabad Lubavitch of Arizona, rabbis asked many of the men if they needed a kippah, a small head covering. One man accepted, receiving a blue and white striped cap. That act, and countless other tiny ones like it, are examples of the Jewish pride needed to survive in the wake of apparently anti-Semitic tragedy, said Rabbi Moshe ...

Josh Rosen can’t tell you exactly what he said in the huddle before leading the Cardinals on their game-winning drive Sunday afternoon against the 49ers. The language was just a little too naughty to share. “Something with some expletives,” the rookie quarterback said after his team’s 18-15 victory at State Farm Stadium. “You’ve gotta leave it up to the imagination.” Left tackle D.J. Humphries didn’t mind sharing Rosen’s message at all. “‘We’re about to win this f-----g game,’ that’s what he said,” Humphries said. “Excuse my French. That’s what he said. … I’m with it. I’d been thinking that... At halftime, San Francisco held a 5-3 lead, but the first two quarters weren't exactly a defensive showcase at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Both offenses hurt themselves early in the game. The Cardinals defense's ability to contain the run and give fresh looks helped them leave with an 18-15 win over the 49ers. The defense was missing starting tackle Corey Peters, but the defensive line still kept the pressure on quarterback C.J. Beathard throughout the game. They sacked Beathard four times and hit him an additional four. Defensive end Markus Golden got the ball rolling, sacking Beathard f... Lawyers representing Democratic congressional candidate Hiral Tipirneni sent letters to multiple television stations Saturday requesting they take down ads her opponent, Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, is running. Tipirneni and Lesko are facing off in the 8th Congressional District, a rematch of the special election earlier this year, where Lesko bested Tipirneni. Tiperneni said her opponent's ads are "falsely equating" her health care plan with Bernie Sanders' "Medicare For All" idea, which she said Lesko "knows to be untrue." Letters from Tipirneni's attorney, Lynda Vescio, went to Cha... In his 15 NFL seasons, Larry Fitzgerald has caught 1,268 passes, gained 15,902 yards and scored 112 touchdowns. He's done about everything with a football that a receiver can do. That changed on Sunday. After catching a pass for a two-point conversion in the final minutes, Fitzgerald wound up and spiked a football for the first time in his life. It was as much a release of frustration as it was a moment of celebration, and it showed what an 18-15 victory over the 49ers meant to a downtrodden team on the edge of fracturing. But to hear Fitzgerald tell it, the reason for the spike was strictl... With nine days until the election, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema, urged her campaign volunteers and supporters to increase canvassing efforts. "We have a lot of work left to do.

He searched through each of the tunnels deep in the Earth for any signs of glimmering gold. His records showed there might be more gold hidden within the darkness of one particular shaft. The possibility of finding the mother lode was too strong to stay away, Waddell recounted during a press conference at Banner – University Medical Center Ph...

---split---6.0---split---https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMNH4hwsw7p-GAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen---split---NEW YORK (AP) — The shooting rampage that killed 11 people at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue is being decried as the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Statistics show that long before the gunfire, anti-Semitism has been on the rise in the United States. Jews make up only about 2 percent of the U.S. population, but in annual FBI data they repeatedly account for more than half of the Americans targeted by hate crimes committed due to religious bias. The Anti-Defamation League identified nearly 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. in 2017, up from 1,267 in 2016. It also report...

BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel won’t try to influence talks on who succeeds her as conservative party leader. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer spending rose by an inflation-adjusted 0.3 percent in September, led by increased spending on health care services and motor vehicles. The Commerce Department also says that the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation returned to the central bank’s 2 annual percent target after having been slightly elevated in prior months. In addition, personal incomes rose 0.2 percent in September — the smallest gain since June 2017 and roughly half of that increase was wiped out by inflation.

The release said Hartman was registered to vote in both states and had cast ballots nine times in both since 2006. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended for one year of probation and ordered to pay a $100 fine and court costs.

But standing out from the crowd isn’t easy, even when a phone offers innovative features. One such smartphone launches this week from Red, a company with roots in movie cameras. Its Hydrogen One has a holographic screen that produces 3-D visuals without making you wear special glasses. The challenge will be finding customers beyond gadget elitists.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. On 'Sunday Morning Futures,' the Homeland Security committee chair reacts to the response to the deadly synagogue shooting and wave of package bombs and speaks out on the threat posed by the migrant caravan. PITTSBURGH – A solemn but powerful presence was seen in Pittsburgh — as thousands crowded into Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall. So many came that many more were pouring into the streets and huddled together in the rain for a candlelight vigil. The teary-eyed crowd spoke of resilience, healing, and gun control the day after a mass shooting claimed the lives of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue. The latter, gun control, is bringing forth mixed emotions for many who stood divided on President Trump’s recent statement: “If they had protection the results would have been far better.” It is a stance that he has echoed in past mass murders. While many attendees never imagined having to have the conversation of arming places of worship, residents in the city known for its friendly hellos and tight-knit communities stood together mourning the loss of their neighbors, and acknowledging yet another mass shooting. An October 28 vigil after the mass shooting in Pittsburgh. (Fox News) Ray Iwanonkiw Sr., a resident of a neighboring community agrees with Trump’s position: “We need protection,” he continued, explaining that while he doesn’t believe violence will solve violence, he just doesn’t see any sensible way to stop what he calls the “insensible.” “If people know that there is the presence of security here [in places of worship] they are going to back off,” he added. Logan Gatenby, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, says he was born in 1996, and he frankly can’t remember a time when armed forces and metal detectors weren’t the norms. “I was born after Columbine,” said Gatenby. “When someone has the intentions to do something this heinous I don’t know if government action or policy can really change someone’s intention to do something so evil.” But when asked if he would feel safer with armed guards in his place of worship, his response was unsure. “I just don’t know about the concept,” said Gatenby. He added that in the city of Mr. Rogers, “for every one person you see doing something hateful, there are hundreds who are trying to help.” ACCUSED KILLER DESCRIBED AS BLAND BY UNSUSPECTING NEIGHBORS According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, a total of 293 mass shooting incidents have occurred in 2018 — Saturday’s shooting marks the 294th. It's a number Rabbi Ethan Linden, both a former resident, and now leader of a New York congregation, says he won’t accept as a norm. “I lived in Europe for two years, and every synagogue has a police officer in front of it and always felt to me like a sad statement,” said Linden. Community members created a makeshift memorial to honor shooting victims on Murray Avenue in the Squirrel Hills neighborhood of Pittsburgh. (Fox News) “I don’t want people to have to have guns to go to synagogue, school, or to camps I want us to find some common sense changes so that people don’t feel like they need to be armed just to leave their homes.” TIMELINE OF PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE In a community still grieving, vigils like Sunday's are the first step in finding peace and discussing how and if they can return to a sense of normalcy. And while normal may look different for the group, they have all taken comfort in one another and found peace that suspect Robert Bowers is no longer a threat to their community. “I don’t have all the answers,” said Iwanonkiw. “And everyone may not agree with me, but I am thankful and proud of how we’ve come together.” Bowers’ first court appearance is scheduled for October 29.

After Cesar Sayoc Jr. drove around in a white van with a photo of Michael Moore with a bullseye on it, the Fahrenheit 11/9 director realized that this was not the first time he has seen Sayoc, who was arrested Friday in connection with a series of bombs mailed to CNN, prominent Democrats and critics of Donald Trump. Moore took to Twitter to share a video of Sayoc in Melbourne, Florida at Trump’s first “Trump 2020 Re-election Rally” in 2017. The footage was for Fahrenheit 11/9, but didn’t make the final cut. “My direction to my producer Basel Hamdan and our longtime collaborator Eric Weinrib... A synagogue massacre.

In a pre-election prayer, The Big Bang Theory creator Chuck Lorre beseeched the Lord to inspire voters to rebuke the “fascist” in the White House, to give strength and wisdom to special counsel Robert Mueller, and to go Old Testament on those “who collaborate with the darkness.” All of that in the show-closing vanity card in the closing credits for Thursday’s Big Bang Theory episode. It’s not the first time Lorre has taken a jab at Donald Trump in his signature vanity cards displayed at the end of his shows. But it’s the first time he’s used the F-word (for fascist) to describe the Presiden... Coming off an exhausting and amazing record-breaking Game 3 on Friday, the winning Los Angeles Dodgers turned a likely Game 4 triumph into tragedy and dropped a big lead at home last night to now see the Boston Red Sox on the verge of winning the 2018 World Series. Spurred on by Mitch Moreland’s three-run home-run in the seventh inning, the Boston boys clawed back in front of around 54,400 baseball fans at Dodger Stadium to end the nearly four-hour game with a victorious 9-6 score. A result that sees the now 3-1 leading Red Sox looking at their first World Series championship since beating ... Hollywood Twitter continued mourning the Pittsburgh Tree of Life massacre today, sending out condolences and a renewed vow to challenge politicians on gun control policies. Some took umbrage at President Donald Trump, blaming his rhetoric and a series of tone-deaf maneuvers during the latter stages of Saturday. The President, who earlier in the day sent numerous tweets mourning and decrying the senseless attack, kept to his planned Saturday schedule and held an Illinois Make America Great Again rally later in the day. During that, he jokingly referred to a “bad hair day” in his remarks. He ... Sunday AM Update after Friday 11:04PM and Saturday AM update: While it’s often written that the weekend that lands prior to or around Halloween is deathly slow, it really depends on what the studios put on the marquee. We could have said the same thing about the third weekend in October, that it’s just a platform for lackluster wares, a pig pile of counter-programming. But Universal/Miramax/Blumhouse’s Halloween proved that business theory wrong last weekend with the second-best start ever for the month with $76.2M. And the horror sequel is showing again that there’s money to be made at the... Noted playwright, poet and novelist, Ntozake Shange died on Saturday morning.

It’s been 26 years since NBC’s The Golden Girls retired from the airwaves but the geriatric sitcom is alive and well as a licensing brand name and — as flaky as it may sound — fan demand for The Golden Girls breakfast cereal is so high that boxes are being hawked on eBay for as much as $100. The limited-edition Golden Girls multigrain cereal was introduced Sept. 30 as an in-store exclusive at Target stores and online but the sold-out quickly. The blue-hued loops were marketed as a “tasty treat, fun to eat” but the real allure was the anime-style collectible Golden Girls vinyl figures tucked... In the latest installment of James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke on Friday, the Late Late Show host welcomed singer Michael Buble. As with every other Carpool Karaoke segment, the two sang some of the crooner’s greatest hits such as “Haven’t Met You Yet” and “It’s A Beautiful Day”, but the conversation took an emotional turn when they started talking about Buble’s son and his cancer diagnosis. Buble said that when they received the news about his son Noah’s cancer diagnosis in 2016, his “whole life ended.” “It’s so hard to have to acknowledge it because it’s so painful to talk about,” he said.

President Donald Trump called for better security in public places today, including the possibility of armed guards at houses of worship. Speaking at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before departing for an Indianapolis speech, he decried the “hate in our country” and insisted that steps be taken. “They had a maniac walk in and they didn’t have any protection and that is so sad to see,” Trump said in Maryland. “If you take a look at it, if they had protection inside, the results would have been far better.” Trump made similar suggestion after February’s Parkland, Florida school shootings, say... Producer and filmmaker Adi Shankar has said in an interview that Apu, the long-running convenience store owner from The Simpsons, may be out of the series. Shankar told Indiewire in an interview that “multiple sources” told him that Apu would be quietly dropped in order to avoid further controversy.

Garcetti said that the LAPD would step up patrols and has reached out to community leaders to address any concerns in the wake of the incident.

President Donald Trump has been on the road a lot lately, doing three Make America Great Again rallies just in the last week. But the President isn’t totally relying on live events as he tries to push for fellow Republicans in the midterms. He’s also using Twitter shout-outs. Today’s early tweetstorm mainly focused on stumping for various Republican candidates around the country, as the Commander-in-Tweet used his considerable number of followers (reduced in the last week, much to his chagrin, but a Twitter cleanup operation) to spread the word on the coming elections. The tweetstorm so far... Clocking in at a stunning seven hours and 20 minutes with 18 innings, Game 3 of the 2018 World Series made history last night as the longest fall classic ever. In a town that loves to go large, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 3-2 at home victory over the Boston Red Sox also beat the previous World Series record of most innings in a single game.

Baseball fans on Twitter were livid on Friday night, as DirecTV experienced technical difficulties that took the service offline in the 10th inning of the World Series.

The teams remained tied into the 11th inning. Boston leads the Series two games to none. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to take the World Series, making this practically a make or break g... UPDATE, with New Rules Halloween video The hashtag “#MAGAbomber” came for Cesar Sayoc Jr. nearly as quickly as his arrest today, but Bill Maher reached back a couple years for something a tad more classic. “Is it okay to call this one deplorable?,” Maher asked during his opening monologue on tonight’s Real Time With Bill Maher. “Or would that hurt Republicans’ feelings?” Maher would eventually get to his annual gripe about politically correct (or not) Halloween costumes (watch that video bit above, and read about it below), but first he had some laughs to squeeze from that mail bomber – and... President Donald Trump lashed out at the media tonight at a Make America Great Again rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, claiming it was trying to blame him for the recent bomb package scares. The arrest of Cesar Sayoc, who is suspected of mailing explosive devices prominent Democrats, was not something that should be tied to Trump followers, the President said. “The media has tried to attack the incredible supporters of our movement,” Trump said. “We want honest coverage from the media. That’s all we want.” Trump gave kudos to the FBI, Secret Service, and state and local law enforcement fo...

---split---7.0---split---http://www.marketwatch.com/story/multiple-people-dead-at-synagogue-in-suburban-pittsburgh-2018-10-27?mod=hp_LATEST---split---Published: Oct 28, 2018 9:22 a.m. ET 46-year-old suspect was not previously known to law enforcement By Eleven people were dead after a shooting Saturday morning at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and six were injured, including four law-enforcement members, according to municipal, state and federal officials who appeared at a late-afternoon news conference. No children were among the dead. The suspect, identified by law enforcement and local media as 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident Robert Bowers, was also injured. Bowers late Saturday was charged with 29 federal counts, including hate-crime and firearm offenses. Police were first called, officials said, at 9:54 a.m. on Saturday regarding an active-shooter situation at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the heavily populated residential area of Squirrel Hill and the first officers were dispatched to the synagogue a minute later. Two police officers were injured in an initial exchange with the shooter,, and two others, SWAT team members, were injured later in the incident. The suspect,who appeared pending further investigation to have acted alone ultimately surrendered, officials said. Bowers legally owned all his weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s in-charge agent, the entire deadly incident lasted 20 minutes. Bowers, whom officials revealed at the news conference was previously unknown to law enforcement, was said to have posted numerous messages of racial hatred on social media, including one as recently as Saturday morning, the Jewish sabbath, saying, in part: “Screw your optics. I’m going in.” CBS News reported that the shooter shouted, “All Jews must die,” during the attack. An official at the news conference said the suspect was in possession inside the synagogue of an assault rifle — local media reports described it as an AR-15–style rifle — along with three handguns. In addition to his antisemitic postings, including some on the Gab site, reputedly a favorite of the alt-right, Bowers was said to have been critical of President Donald Trump, whom he is believed to have viewed as not sufficiently ethnonationalist. “There is no #MAGA,” reads a Bowers post from this week on Gab, “as long as there is a [anti-Jewish slur] infestation.” The attack is being investigated as a hate crime, said Gov. Tom Wolf at the news conference late Saturday. Wolf said mass shootings cannot be accepted as a standard feature of American life. Bowers was reported to be receiving medical treatment. Earlier Saturday, the governor described in a tweet what officials of the commonwealth had initially learned, saying: “We are still learning details about the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh but it is a serious situation.” We are still learning details about the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh but it is a serious situation. @PAStatePolice are assisting local first responders. Please stay away from the area and keep the congregants and law enforcement in your prayers. President Donald Trump tweeted that he, too, was watching the tragic events unfold: Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All! Wolf later tweeted that he was headed to the scene: On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need. Trump added in brief comments to journalists that something “has to be done” about the atmosphere of hatred in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, suggesting, as he has in the past, that armed guards inside the synagogue may have created a different outcome in Saturday’s tragedy. Trump: "It's just a shame. To watch this and to see this, for so many years, so much of it, is absolutely a shame." Later, after flying to Indianapolis, Trump told a Future Farmers of America conference that, in memory of the Pittsburgh dead, a future of justice, safety and tolerance should be fought for, before going on to talk about the trade, tax and other policies of his administration that he characterized as agriculture-friendly. He went on to speak disparaging of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and to lament his unlikelihood of winning a Nobel prize: Trump seemed to be semi-arguing with his speechwriter out loud here. https://t.co/Jo9g1g7aDw ! Trump praises Norman Borlaug for his Nobel Peace Prize, then says, "They probably will never give it to me, even what I'm doing in Korea, and Idlib province, and all these places. They probably will never give it to me. You know why? Because they don't want toooo." Trump headed from the youth event in Indianapolis to a political rally in Murphysboro, Ill., on Saturday night. The White House, and Trump himself per his remarks in Indianapolis, had reportedly mulled canceling the rally in light of the synagogue shooting but decided to go forward with it, saying, according to CBS, “We can’t let evil change our life and change our schedule.” Early in the day, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that the White House was monitoring the event, and first lady Melania Trump said, also on Twitter, that she was heartbroken over the mass shooting and that the “violence needs to stop”: Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all. My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America. There were reportedly three services being held simultaneously at the synagogue, a house of worship for multiple congregations, at the time of the attack, according to reports early Saturday. One, according to reports, was a bris, a circumcision ceremony performed on the eighth day of a boy’s life. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Air quality across Europe is slowly improving, but harmful emissions remain stubbornly high in some countries, according to a study released Monday by the European Environment Agency. The Copenhagen-based agency calculated that air pollution caused more than half a million premature deaths across Europe in 2015 — mostly from tiny airborne particles known as PM2.5. However, improvements in air quality mean the number of premature deaths is about half the level it was in 1990, the European Union agency said.

One bright summer morning four years ago, two park rangers set off hiking up a dormant Alaskan volcano. But like a light switch, the weather changed. Vicious winds brought frigid, sideways rain. It didn't relent. Usually dry ditches transformed into swiftly flowing creeks, and the rivers grew higher. The rangers found rocky shelter to wait out the storm, but one foolish ranger — ill-equipped with cotton socks that day — experienced both an immeasurably miserable and nearly-harmful journey back to safety: Wet cotton socks don't insulate. The lesson: In the outdoors, simple gear matters — a l... It's Troll Week on Mashable. Join us as we explore the good, the bad, and the ugly of internet trolling.

The president was slated to spend 30 minutes on the phone with CEOs and make brief remarks at a state leadership conference. He was b... LOS ANGELES — Michael Avenatti has assembled a team of Democratic political veterans who are helping him coordinate meetings with donors, connect with national and state party officials, craft messaging and build out a digital fundraising apparatus designed to enable a 2020 presidential bid. Avenatti’s already long prospects suffered a blow Thursday after he was quoted in Time magazine saying that the Democratic presidential nominee who will battle President Donald Trump “better be a white male” —remarks he contends were taken out of context. The same day, the Senate Judiciary Committee ref... In February of this year, at the close of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, the pro-Trump blogger Mike Cernovich trekked to the Capitol Hill townhouse that serves as the personal headquarters for former White House adviser Steve Bannon. The inconspicuous brick building, once the unofficial Washington bureau for Breitbart News, had grown into an unlikely center of political gravity during the presidency of Donald Trump. Now out of the White House, the president’s former chief strategist was still holding court there for a steady stream of journalists, do... Democrats have religiously deferred to special counsel Robert Mueller over the last 17 months, hamstrung by their lack of congressional power and expressing faith that the respected investigator will get the job done if left alone. That could all change after November. If Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections, they’re prepared to use their newfound subpoena power to aggressively open probes into President Donald Trump’s finances and connections to Russia. But doing so — just as Mueller appears to be entering the final laps of his own probe — would create tensions between the s... And President Donald Trump returns to partisan mode after the Pittsburgh mass shooting. MIAMI — Former President Barack Obama plans to rally for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson on Nov. 2 in Florida, an appearance that will be bookended by President Trump rallying for the Democrats’ rivals for governor and Senate in the Sunshine State on Oct. 31 and Nov. 3. The get-out-the-vote rallies from the two most popular figures in their respective parties underscore the national importance of the two top-of-the-ticket races in the country’s biggest swing state. And they show just how much Democrats and Republicans want to turn out their bases in the t... Decision follows heavy losses in state election. Democrats eager to investigate the Trump administration if they seize the House would have the GOP to thank for one of their most potent tools — a sweeping subpoena authority that Democratic lawmakers denounced as an abusive power grab three years ago. House Republicans changed the rules in 2015 to allow many of their committee chairmen to issue subpoenas without consulting the minority party, overriding Democrats objections that likened the tactic to something out of the McCarthy era. Now the weapon that the GOP wielded dozens of times against Barack Obama’s agencies could allow Democrats ... Hours after calling for a more civil national discourse in the wake of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump on Sunday ridiculed one of the targets of a spate of pipe bombs sent to high-profile members of the Democratic Party last week. Following an appearance by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the president derided the billionaire liberal activist as “Wacky” and criticized his performance in the morning-show interview, conducted by journalist Jake Tapper. “Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be inte... President Donald Trump could see up to six Cabinet officials depart in the weeks after next month’s midterm elections, according to interviews with a half-dozen current and former Trump officials and Republicans close to the White House. For a president who has already shed or shuffled up eight Cabinet officials, that would make for the highest turnover rate in recent history. It would also be a major disruption even by the standards of an ever-churning administration — possibly creating new confusion across departments and agencies and risking multiple bloody Senate confirmation fights. Th... Compete against the nation’s top political minds by picking the winners of competitive House, Senate and gubernatorial races. Attorney Michael Avenatti on Sunday night assailed President Donald Trump’s “racism and bigotry,” painting himself as the working-class fighter who can stand up to the president’s “unusual cruelty” and “make America decent again.” An aggressive trial attorney and 2020 hopeful, Avenatti has sold himself as the Democrat tough enough to take on Trump. He’s best known for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against the president over what was characterized as a 2016 hush money payment. But his presidential ambitions took a major hit last week when he was quoted in Time magaz... SAO PAULO — Jair Bolsonaro, a brash far-right congressman who has waxed nostalgic for Brazil’s old military dictatorship, won the presidency of Latin America’s largest nation Sunday as voters looked past warnings that he would erode democracy and embraced a chance for radical change after years of turmoil. The former army captain, who cast himself as a political outsider despite a 27-year career in Congress, became the latest world leader to rise to power by mixing tough, often violent talk with hard-right positions. His victory reflected widespread anger at the political class after years ... Anti-Semitism has "moved from the margins into the mainstream," Anti-Defamation League CEO and National Director Jonathan Greenblatt said Sunday. His remarks on NBC's "Meet the Press" came a day after a gunman fatally shot 11 and injured seven others in Pittsburgh in the deadliest attack on a synagogue in U.S. history. The tragedy can be linked to concurrent political rhetoric, Greenblatt said. "Political candidates and people in public life now lineally repeat the rhetoric of white supremacists," Greenblatt said. "They think it's normal and permissible to talk about Jewish conspiracies, ma... The chairmen of the Republican and Democratic congressional campaign committees called for political unity Sunday in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. "We all bear some responsibility," National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We need to clean up our act and try to bring more civility to our Congress and, frankly, to our dialogue."

The Department of Homeland Security is "more prepared than we've ever been" to ensure the security of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says. "The goal here ... is absolutely to assure Americans that their votes will count and their votes will be counted correctly," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "We are constantly monitoring, constantly working with them, sharing information." Among other measures , Nielsen said, her department will be establishing a "virtual Situation Room."

It should be "up to the families themselves" whether President Donald Trump attends any memorial event for those killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Mayor Bill Peduto said Sunday. "That's really up to the families themselves," Peduto told NBC News' "Meet the Press." "You know, we're going to be working together as we have." The Sabbath shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue left 11 dead and others injured, making it the deadliest synagogue attack in U.S. history. Speaking at a rally later that day, Trump called the act "an anti-Semitic attack at its worst." He then announced plan... Local and federal law enforcement officials said Sunday that the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue entered the building Saturday morning making statements about genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people as congregants were in the middle of worship. "A place of worship is a scared place. It is a place of peace. It is a place of grace. It is a place where a community comes together to celebrate that they hold most dear and most scared," Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, told reporters during a Sunday morning news conference of th... A Department of Homeland Security adviser visited the Pittsburgh synagogue that was the site of a mass shooting Saturday "as recently as March," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says. "We actually conducted a site visit there with our protective security adviser in the area," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "This is something we often do." "We feel that the best way to help communities support their efforts in terms of protection is to be there, to be there on the ground, to listen to them, to understand their needs." Protective security advisers are "trained critical infrastruc... HAMILTON, Mont. — Sen. Rand Paul says he’s not going to let Saudi Arabia off the hook after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Turkey by agents linked to the Saudi government. The Kentucky Republican said Saturday he’s intent on forcing another vote to block billions in arm sales to the autocratic Middle Eastern kingdom and won’t settle for targeted sanctions, seeking to capitalize on negative public sentiment surrounding the Oct. 2 killing. “Are we going to do fake sanctions? Are we going to pretend to do something by putting sanctions on 15 thugs. Or are we going to do something tha... The throngs of protesters who stormed Capitol Hill late last month didn’t succeed in keeping Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. But they did furnish Donald Trump and the Republicans with an election-season message to energize their base. Ever since Americans saw the atria and corridors of the Senate buildings teem with foot soldiers of the resistance, the president and other Republicans have been trying to stoke fears of social chaos with overblown rhetoric comparing Democrats to a mob. “The only way to shut down the Democrats new Mob Rule strategy is to stop them cold at the Ballot Box... In this political environment, it’s easy to look at Republicans and Democrats as having next to nothing in common. Regardless of the issue at hand, we see them as wanting completely different things—especially when it comes to issues of sex and sexuality. From differences in the way they have approached the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to their views on abortion and same-sex marriage, Democrats and Republicans appear worlds apart. It’s not just their public policy positions that seem to differ wildly, though. According to the largest and most comp... People are worried about what’s happening on the internet—and they should be. In just the past few months, Americans have seen massive social turmoil over the deletion of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ accounts from digital platforms; the public disclosure of criminal charges for Russian interference in the upcoming midterm elections; and other continuing developments in disinformation operations, such as the the Kremlin’s new digital campaign to turn U.S. public opinion against taking military action against Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. But these latest incidents are only part of a far... Megyn Kelly’s elopement with NBC was a marriage that almost nobody wanted to see work. Her new colleagues at the network resented the $20 million annual salaryshe reportedly collected upon arriving at the network in 2017. Today show veterans viewed new show, Megyn Kelly Today as an interloper that succeeded only in garnering worse ratings than an existing show in the Today franchise (Today’s Take) in the network’s line-up. Liberals and centrists found outrage in a conservative media star from the Fox News Channel being rewarded with a prestigious broadcast slot. Many fans of her old Fox sho... INDIAN TRAIL, N.C.—The other day, under a bright blue sky, a woman in a red shirt and a red hat stood outside the Hemby Bridge Volunteer Fire Department and distributed pamphlets touting Republican candidates to arriving early voters. “May I share some information with you?” retired teacher Ginny Shaffer asked again and again. She was having no trouble finding takers. One woman just gave her a smile and a thumbs-up.

TAPACHULA, MEXICO—Rosa Gonzalez arrived in the shelter here after leaving her native El Salvador suddenly in late summer, fleeing her small town with her older brother and a few possessions, hoping to avoid becoming yet another murder statistic at the hands of her country’s violent gangs Rosa’s problem hadn’t started with the gangs, but with her husband. He drank, and when he was drunk enough he liked to beat up Rosa. One night, earlier in the summer, he came home and beat her up again. For Rosa, it was the last straw. She took her two kids and left. He begged her to come home, but she refu... Democrat Brian Forde raised nearly half a million dollars of bitcoin for his unsuccessful bid for a California congressional seat this year, but then had to field questions from election watchdogs about a contribution from Hong Kong. Republican Austin Petersen, a U.S. Senate candidate from Missouri, received the largest single bitcoin donation in federal election history, but was forced to return the virtual currency in June because it exceeded federal contribution limits.

In federal penitentiaries across the nation, prisoners eagerly awaiting a transfer to halfway houses say they are being told that they will have to wait weeks or months longer than they had anticipated because there is a shortage of beds at the transitional group homes. But that’s not true. According to inmates, halfway house staff and industry officials, scores of beds lie empty, with some estimates of at least 1,000 vacant spaces. They remain unused due to a series of decisions that have sharply reduced the number of prisoners sent to halfway houses. And home confinement, a federal arrang... The United States was founded on the premise that all individuals are created equal, with certain unalienable rights. Throughout our history, Americans have fought and died for these rights. They are ingrained in the fabric of our society and regularly debated, whether in coffee shops on Main Street or the halls of Congress. Those fundamental rights and freedoms are part of our national identity, but that’s not the case in other parts of the world. That’s why for more than a century, the United States has been a vocal supporter, not just rhetorically but financially, as well, of global huma... The press gave primo coverage to Donald Trump’s outrageous utterances during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries because, well, he was a front-runner, and when front-runners speak, it’s news. After Trump secured the Republican nomination, the press gave similar notice to his tongue-wagging because—well, because it believes every trill and chirrup from a major-party nominee contains news value. Later, when Trump became president and the press continued to steer his tweets, White House lawn utterances, and MAGA-rally speeches onto Page One, the justification for the saturation coverage... The three-way test of wills over Saudi Arabia’s murder of an exiled journalist has started to play out in oil markets. Each day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintains his drip feed of grisly details of Jamal Khashoggi’s killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Each day, a reluctant President Donald Trump is forced to respond to a new revelation. The affair has betrayed a yet unseen presidential aptitude for restraint. Meanwhile, the Saudis’ initially combative tone has been quietly replaced with a more deferential stance. They have opened the valves on their idled oil producti... As the 2018 midterm election cycle enters its final days, a time-honored election tradition is hitting its stride. Contenders for public office are taking to television studios and university campuses across the country to duke it out with their general election rivals, making a final pitch to voters before Nov. 6. POLITICO steps into the arena to show you some of the political sparring matches that have unfolded in just the past week. Warren Buffett's Nevada energy utility is clobbering Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson in a power struggle over the fate of the state's electricity supply. The Omaha investor and the Las Vegas gambling magnate are on opposite sides of a Nevada ballot measure that could rattle the electric power industry: Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns NV Energy,a government-regulated monopoly that ranks as the state's largest utility. And Adelson is bankrolling a campaign to break up the company and take control of where his power-hungry casinos buy electricity. The fight has drawn more political mone... Minnesota hasn’t elected a Republican attorney general in over 40 years. Keith Ellison — the prominent Democratic congressman and No. 2 at the Democratic National Committee — is putting that streak to the test. Rocked by accusations of domestic abuse, Ellison has fallen behind former Minnesota Republican state legislator Doug Wardlow, according to a poll this week. And while each candidate has tagged the other as too far outside the mainstream to be the state's top law enforcement official, in reality the race revolves around Ellison and what voters make of the misconduct allegations he’s f... MISSOULA, Mont. — The Trump family has not forgotten about Sen. Jon Tester’s role in bringing down Ronny Jackson. In his tour barnstorming the state on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, Donald Trump Jr. on Saturday repeatedly lashed Tester for unveiling numerous allegations of misconduct against the former Veteran Affairs nominee, who also serves as a White House doctor. Trump Jr. even said that the Secret Service agents that protect him “can’t stand” Tester’s role in derailing his nomination, during an appearance in rural Ronan. “Jon Tester talks a big game on vets. The only t... KENOSHA, Wisc. — Want to know just how important Wisconsin is in the midterm election? Take a look at the political luminaries who visited over the last six days. Sen. Kamala Harris on Sunday. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday. President Donald Trump on Wednesday. And, the biggest prize of all for Democrats, former President Barack Obama on Friday. With a tight contest for Speaker Paul Ryan’s open congressional seat, a competitive Senate race and a battle for governor that is about as close as it can get, the state that slipped through Democrats’ hands in the 2016 presidential election is getti... President Donald Trump on Saturday said that a fatal shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier in the day has proved to be "far more devastating" than local officials initially feared, as authorities identified a suspect held in custody. “It looks like the results are coming in, and they're far more devastating than anybody originally thought in the morning,” the president told reporters at a news conference at Joint Base Andrews. “In the morning, they thought that it was a shooter, but they had the shooter, they soon would, but the results are very devastating. You're seeing the numbers c... The White House is lowering expectations that Republicans will maintain control of the House in the midterm elections — while positioning President Donald Trump to claim credit for any seats his party gains in the Senate. White House political director Bill Stepien wrote a three-page memo this week in which he outlined the political landscape confronting the GOP and bluntly warned that the party’s prospects for the House are “challenging.” “House Republicans’ goal this year is to minimize their losses,” he wrote in the memo, which was distributed to senior administration officials. A copy w... President Donald Trump by his own admission toned down his fiery political rhetoric at a rally in southern Illinois on Saturday evening, following a fatal mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The president delivered few of his trademark blistering attacks on his political rivals or adversarial groups during the rally at the 8,000-seat Murphysboro airport hangar to boost statewide political allies ahead of the midterm elections, delivering a largely aspirational address. Although Trump frequently insults the members of the media on site to cover his remarks, the president resisted cri... The would-be terrorist who failed to harm CNN and George Soros did succeed at one thing: ruining President Donald Trump’s week. Trump had hoped to capitalize on growing Republican enthusiasm in the final weeks of the midterm campaign — stoking fears of a Central American migrant caravan and hoping his Thursday unveiling of a plan to lower prescription drug prices would hold the news media’s attention heading into the weekend. But even Trump can’t shape the media narrative to his will amid an attempt at mass political assassination and a nationwide manhunt. "It didn’t get the kind of coverag... Authorities on Friday charged a man who appeared to be an emphatic supporter of President Donald Trump with sending suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics, while the president expressed frustration that the attacks were distracting from the midterms. The FBI arrested Cesar Sayoc, a 56-year-old Florida man, and charged him with five federal crimes — from mailing explosives to threatening former presidents — that carry a sentence of up to 58 years in prison. The federal complaint included 13 explosive devices that were bound for high-profile Democrats and CNN. It also detailed how mis... President Donald Trump on Friday evening accused the media of using a nationwide bomb-threat scare to "score political points against me" and the GOP ahead of the midterm elections. "We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party," Trump told supporters during a rally in Charlotte, N.C., alluding to the actions of a fervent Trump supporter who was arrested and charged Friday for allegedly sending 14 potentially explosive devices to prominent Democrats from Barack Obama to Robert ... BOSTON—One Sunday night two years ago, Marc Ebuña and Ari Ofsevit stayed up past 1 a.m. to watch the city’s transit system grind to a pointless halt. Sitting in their respective apartments, they were monitoring a website that tracks Boston’s rapid-transit trains in real time. “I live-tweeted the late-night ballet, the last-trains ballet,” Ebuña says. Except what they were seeing was more of a citywide muscle spasm than an elegant dance. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority barely acknowledged this nightly jam, and wasn’t doing anything about it. So Ebuna and Ofsevit, who had plent... To be a millennial in Boston means putting yourself at the mercy of one of the oldest and least well-funded transit systems in America. A common thread is running through nearly every tech debate in Washington these days: fear that an ambitious China is poised to win the next wave of technology. The worry that China is preparing to eat America’s lunch is the subtext for nearly all policy discussions on next-generation tech like quantum computing that can break encryption, artificial intelligence that can spy on or supplant humans, and super-fast wireless networks that can power an advanced digital economy. And it's causing rattled U.S. policymakers to flirt with some of the same top-down, regimented strategies that Beijing ... For more than 10 years, Aaron Belkin slowly and methodically worked to shift public opinion on “don’t ask, don’t tell,” chipping away at the hardened view that openly gay Americans had no place in the military. When the law was repealed in 2011, the San Francisco State University political science professor felt vindication in his belief that an aggressive communications campaign can bring success to long-shot causes. Now Belkin has a new target: the Supreme Court. Belkin and fellow academic-activists have launched the 1/20/21 Project, which aims to add four seats to the Supreme Court soon ... PORTSMOUTH, Ohio — Two years after Ohio swooned over Donald Trump’s law-and-order presidential campaign, the state is weighing a decidedly un-Trumplike solution to its spiraling opioid epidemic: Stop locking up drug users, and instead use the money to treat them. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray is embracing a proposal on the ballot that would downgrade all drug possession crimes to misdemeanors and prohibit jail time for all but the most frequent offenders, a move that has put him out of step with key state officials and even some in his own party — and sets up a test of ... President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Democrats are threatening to endanger patients with pre-existing conditions while Republicans will protect them — an assertion at odds with his administration’s own persistent efforts to dismantle Obamacare. “Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican,” Trump tweeted, part of a ramp-up of his rhetoric on health care ahead of the midterm elections. Public health experts say his claims are inaccurate, given his administration's moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act's safeguards... A caravan of Central American immigrants headed for the U.S. through Mexico "is not getting in," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vows. "My general message to this caravan is: Do not come," Nielsen told "Fox News Sunday." "You will not be allowed in." "There is a right way to immigrate to the United States," she added, "and this is not it." Since its formation, the caravan has reportedly swelled to more than 7,000 people. But its size is nothing new, Nielsen said. "We have a crisis at the border right now ... [and] this caravan is one iteration of that," Nielsen said. "Frankly, ...

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Eleven people gathered for a baby naming service were shot to death and four police officers wounded after a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life synagogue; Garrett Tenney reports from Pittsburgh. The alleged gunman in Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue spewed anti-Semitic posts on a social media platform where he claimed that Jews were "the enemy of white people," according to a report. Two hours before Robert Bowers, 46, allegedly burst into the Tree of Life Synagogue and opened fire during a Shabbat service, he posted on the chat site Gab.com about the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the New York Times reported. This image shows a portion of an archived webpage from the social media website Gab posting by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. (Associated Press) “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” a message attributed to Bowers said. HIAS, a Maryland-based nonprofit, helps refugees around the world and is guided by Jewish values, according to the organization. In total, Bowers allegedly killed 11 people and wounded at least six, including four police officers. He was also wounded and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. A criminal complaint said the 11 dead were eight men and three women, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Authorities did not immediately identify them. Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of HIAS, told the Associated Press he wasn’t aware of Bowers "until this morning," meaning after the shooting. A U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania filed 29 federal charges against Bowers Saturday night, the Post-Gazette reported. The suspect also faces local charges, the report said. The federal charges include 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING LEAVES 11 DEAD AND 6 WOUNDED; SUSPECT HIT WITH MULTIPLE CHARGES “The actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity,” said Scott W. Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.” Gab.com promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to sites like Twitter, which some critics say monitors content too rigidly. Just recently, President Trump complained that Twitter had purged some of his followers. Since the Bowers account launched on Gab in January, there have been frequent posts on the account about Jews, including conspiracy theories, according to reports by the New York Times and Associated Press. One post read: “Open your eyes! It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!” Another featured a photo of a Nazi concentration camp used to cremate Jews. A caption read “Make Ovens 1488F Again.” The first two words refer to the white supremacist “14 Words” slogan and “88” stands for “Heil Hitler” because “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Other posts featured conspiracy theories about the Holocaust, in which six million Jews perished during World War II. Other Bowers posts criticized President Trump, according to the reports. In one post, he called the president a “globalist, not a nationalist. There is no #MAGA as long as there is a [slur for Jews] infestation.” A month ago, he posted photos of three handguns he called his “glock family,” Reuters reported. Gab.com said in a statement that it suspended Bowers' account after his name was mentioned on police radio chatter about the Pittsburgh shooting. It then backed up the content on the account and alerted the FBI, the company said. “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,” a statement read. Gab's founder and CEO posted that PayPal has banned the site from using its online payment service. "The company is diligent in performing reviews and taking account actions. When a site is explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action," PayPal spokesman Justin Higgs said. Media tents and vehicles line an intersection near the Tree of Life Synagogue, upper left, where a shooter opened fire Saturday. Police said Bowers had 21 guns registered in his name and was not known to law enforcement before the shooting. He is a registered voter with “no affiliation” in Allegheny County, Pa. “For the record, I did not vote for him nor have I owned, worn or even touched a MAGA hat,” he once posted on social media, referring to President Trump. The shooting follows a pattern of massacres in places of worship and comes days after mail bombs were sent to prominent Democrats. Florida resident Cesar Sayoc Jr. has been charged in connection with the explosive devices. After the shooting, dozens of law enforcement officers descended on Bowers' neighborhood, which is about a 25-minute drive from the synagogue. One man who said he lived in the area for more than 15 years shook his head, noting that many immigrant families had recently moved in. Another woman told the Times she had struggled to understand violent hate. “I can’t believe it has spread out this far,” she said.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/multiple-people-killed-6-injured-163209211.html---split---A shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh has left 11 people dead and six injured, officials announced. President Donald Trump announced that the shooting took place during a baby naming ceremony, though Erika Strassburger, the city councilwoman for the district, said she could not yet confirm that. Trump condemned the shooting at an act of anti-Semitism. No children were injured in the shooting, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich announced at a press conference. The shooting took place at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill section of the city, the department announced in another tweet. It will be prosecuted as a hate crime and the FBI will be leading the investigation, the department announced. A law enforcement official confirms to PEOPLE the suspect is Robert Bowers, 46. The official says investigators are looking at social media posts that might belong to the suspect. Police sources told KDKA the shooter yelled, “All Jews must die” after entering the synagogue during the Saturday morning Shabbat service. The suspect was taken into custody after surrendering to police, according to the Associated Press. Strassberger said the suspect was barricaded by police in the building prior to surrendering and that he was taken to the hospital, the New York Times reports. The Pittsburg Bureau of Police and Public Safety Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. A statement from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian said the hospital is treating four patients. “Three victims are in surgery and one other is stable, awaiting surgery. Another patient at UPMC Presbyterian was treated and released,” the statement said. Allegheny General Hospital spokesman Dan Laurent tells PEOPLE the hospital is treating one patient and isn’t releasing any information about the patient. UPMC Mercy announced the hospital is treating a patient who is currently in surgery. Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who was not present for the shooting, told ABC News that the Jewish neighborhood where the synagogue is located is usually very safe, and he was “stunned” about the violence that had taken place. “There’s absolutely no crime, it’s an amazing neighborhood, it’s hard to believe it’s a city neighborhood,” he said. “It’s dominated by the Jewish community center four blocks away, it’s dominated by kosher bakeries, all kinds of Jewish gift shops, bookshops, a number of synagogues. Crystal Uvalle, 30, who lives nearby and attended bar and bat mitzvahs at the synagogue in her childhood, tells PEOPLE she heard sirens and got an alert on her phone from her employer, the University of Pittsburgh. “We’re still in shock,” she said. “You always knew it was going to happen. Last week, I was thinking, ‘I wonder when this will actually strike us?’ It’s just sad that it did.” Addressing the shooting on social media before the number of deaths and injuries were announced, President Donald Trump wrote, “Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way.” Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement saying, “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying “this one is too many” for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” Local sports teams the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pirates and Penguins issued statements mourning the tragedy. The New York Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department announced they will send officers to protect local synagogues. The Pittsburgh Public Safety Department tweeted, “Families of shooting victims can call 412-432-4400 for news of their loved ones. A Victims Assistance Center has been set up at Chatham University, Berry Hall, 106 Berry Street.”

It is normal for people to feel confused, scared and angry when violence of this magnitude is close to home even if you were not directly impacted,” Governor Tom Wolf said. “Acts of hate send a ripple effect into communities and their purpose is to induce fear in all.

In times such as these having a connection to our community is vital in healing.” Staff from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services’ Office is on site at the Victims Assistance Center set up at the Jewish Community Center, 5738 Forbes Avenue in Pittsburgh, to help with counseling and other support services. Victims and survivors, family members and impacted community members also can access the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) resources for first responders, victims and their loved ones and all affected by this traumatic event. People can call the toll-free Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990 or text “TalkWithUs” to 66746 to receive immediate counseling from trained, caring professionals. Helpline staff can also make referrals to in-person counseling services and other support services. SAMHSA’s Disaster App is also available for first responders. The app helps first responders through all steps of disaster deployment, compiles resources for crisis counseling and behavioral health services, and resources to help first responders cope. The app is available for free through the Apple and Google Play app stores. Those affected by this tragedy also can access free services available through the Center for Victims in Pittsburgh. The center assists with the traumatic impact of crimes and can offer emotional support, counseling, long-term therapeutic assistance and access to the commonwealth’s Crime Victims Compensation Assistance Program, which can provide aid toward various financial expenses that may arise. UPDATED 5:36 PM, Saturday, October 27: Harrisburg, PA – Governor Tom Wolf made the following remarks in response to Saturday morning’s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh: “Today words simply… I can’t express the sadness that all Pennsylvanians feel for what happened today. “I want to give my condolences first of all to the victims of this tragedy, the families, and their friends, and to this community. “This shooting is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime. “My heart breaks for members of the Jewish community. Today all of Pennsylvania mourns with you. “Anti-Semitism has absolutely no place in our commonwealth. Any attack on one community of faith in Pennsylvania is an attack against every community of faith in Pennsylvania. And I want the Jewish community across the commonwealth and across the country to know that we stand in support of you as we together mourn this senseless act of violence. “The Shabbat is a time for reflection, it’s a time for finding peace, not for violence. “Pennsylvania’s Jewish community is strong, is vibrant, and resilient. Now is the time more than ever to come together and to support each other. “I have spent today with first responders, with local leaders, and I am in awe of the bravery of displayed by law enforcement, those folks who help to keep people safe, to aid victims, and to prevent further tragedy. “Federal, state, and local law enforcement are working in concert to investigate this tragedy and to maintain public safety.

My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying “this one is too many” for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.”  On January 20, 2015, Tom Wolf was sworn in as Pennsylvania’s 47th governor.

---split---8.0---split---https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/10/27/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-suspect-identified/---split---Follow KDKA-TV: Facebook | Twitter PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Police say a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh Synagogue on Saturday morning, yelling “All Jews must die.” KDKA-TV sources say the shooting suspect is Robert Bowers.  U.S. Attorney Scott Brady filed federal hate crimes charges against Bowers on Saturday evening. Those charges include: Eleven counts each of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Death and Use of a Firearm to Commit Murder During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence, four counts of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Bodily Injury to a Public Safety Officer and three counts of Use and Discharge of a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence. United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions has issued a statement, saying the Department of Justice will file hate crime charges against Bowers for the shooting. Those charges could “lead to the death penalty.” His full statement reads: “Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety. Today 11 innocent people were suddenly and viciously murdered during religious services and several law enforcement officers were shot. These alleged crimes are reprehensible and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation. Accordingly, the Department of Justice will file hate crimes and other criminal charges against the defendant, including charges that could lead to the death penalty. “It has been an important week for us to show gratitude for the hard work of our law officers around the country. And today was no exception. I want to thank the FBI, ATF, Pittsburgh police, and especially the heroic officers who were so quick to respond to the shooting, including the multiple officers who were shot. These officers ran to danger to save others, which reflects the highest traditions of policing in this country. There can be no doubt that they saved lives today. “The Department of Justice will continue to support our state and local partners and we will continue to bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people.” Police are also investigating if Bowers announced his intentions on social media Saturday morning. His account has since been taken down. Several things posted on his social media accounts show Bowers making several anti-Semitic statements. Just this morning Bowers reportedly posted “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered, screw the optics, I’m going in.”   Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said this shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and as such, the FBI is leading the investigation. “At this time this is being considered a federal violation and the primary investigative agency will be the Federal Bureau of investigation,” Hissrich said. Bowers grew up in Whitehall and is believed to have presently lived in an apartment complex on McAnulty Road in Baldwin Borough. Police, FBI and ATF agents and technicians were at the 11-unit McAnulty apartment complex for most of the day Saturday. PITTSBURGH, PA – OCTOBER 27: A heavy police presence has blocked off a section of McAnulty Road in Baldwin Borough. It is believed the suspected gunman in a shooting a Squirrel Hill’s Tree of Life Synagogue lived in an apartment in that area and that police are processing the scene. (Photo Credit: Ralph Iannotti/KDKA) They were finally permitted inside Saturday night after getting court approval to execute a search warrant. They first checked the building with a robot bomb detector. Chris Hall, one of Bowers’ neighbors, said there was nothing unusual about Bowers. He described him as a truck driver who would come and go regularly. Hall said when Bowers was home, he often had the TV on late at night, but generally, Hall said that Bowers never had company and stayed pretty much to himself. “The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed. No tattoos that I could see, he just looked like an average 50-year-old dude,” Hall said. “He kept to himself. He would smoke his cigarettes in his car. Go for a drive and then be back at odd hours. TV would be on, but I couldn’t really hear it. Just went about my day, he went about his day. I just, I wish there was something that like, something tattooed on him or anything that could say, ‘Hey, this is what’s going on in my head.’ I wish… I just wish we knew.” RELATED LINKS: Eleven people have been killed and a number of others injured after the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill on Saturday. Police sources tell KDKA’s Andy Sheehan the gunman walked into the building and yelled, “All Jews must die.” He was reportedly armed with an AR-15 and two handguns. At least six other people were injured in the shooting. The shooting happened during weekly Shabbat services at the conservative Jewish synagogue, the building was full was full of people for a Saturday service. He needs to be made an example of. He should be hung publicly, tomorrow. This is still the United States. Give him a trial then hang him after he’s found guilty. Real leftists today literally think nothing about turning any current development to their political advantage. Literally, human concerns never enter their minds. They see an opportunity and they use it. They’re following the teachings of Saul Alinsky in ‘Rules for Radicals (1971), which are most effective to the extent that the “organizer” can detach from human decency. At play here are Alinsky’s Rules Nos. 8 and 13: 8 – Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose. 13 – Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Well Done ~ Hypocrisy is the hallmark of Fox Trump and what’s left of the Republican party. you seem to be the one that is pursuing those two so called rules. 1. you are blaming so called “real leftists when it is clearly a white wing extremist the exact opposite and utilizing this event for your dark purpose. 2. You have picked an 60 year old target, frozen it to today personalized it to todays event and polarizing it to your dark advantage. Not sure if I agree. He deserves a fair trial and I hope he doesn’t get death, for one thing, a life in a concrete steel box is what he deserves, and second, it costs millions to execute someone, sometimes taking decades. It’s far cheaper to sentence them with life with no chance of parole. With any luck, he’ll reap what he sows in prison, and if harm comes to him while incarcerated, not many would lose sleep over it. Thoughts and prayers to all the survivors and those affected by this homicidal, stuck on stupid domestic terrorist. This guy is a Trump hater, Trump is a friend of Israel and has jewish family members in the WH. It seems that no one wants to fight the battle on the field of ideas any more. How long have liberals called Israel a terrorist state? Just re-enforces any wackos irrational hatred of the Jewish people. Unfortunately, my first thought was that it was another demonrat/deep state ploy to blame on repubs before the election. It is unfortunate that this is what entered my mind first before my compassion and concern for all the innocent victims kicked in You are a kook. wow! “white male”, I glad the CBS news media is starting to report ethnicity in their crime reports. I am sure CNN & NBC will soon follow suit. White nationalist. Someone that thought Trump needed to be more radical in his nationalist views. That is one pathetic ideology. The dude has already said that he didn’t and never would vote for trump. There’s nothing inherently wrong with nationalism as it includes EVERYONE that’s a citizen in your country. It’s not that hard to figure out… Unless you’re a little slow, in which case, this might include you. Check out his FB friends list. Very racially diverse, although he has lots of young Indonesian girls/boys as FB friends, so he maybe a pedo too. Sad case. I am a Texas now, but love Pittsburgh. A great town with great people. So sorry for you, my friends! I’ll believe it when I see the bodies, see the tears, see the blood. Until then, it is just ANOTHER fake narrative, like the school in Florida, and Las Vegas. Pure hogwash by the Democrats. Hero https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/10/report-pittsburgh-shooter-named-on-police-scanner-is-a-nazi-hated-donald-trump-thought-trump-controlled-by-jews/ It’s simply stunning how many of you posting are willing to leap into a political narrative to support whatever point of view you have. Listen and learn and then draw conclusions. Compare, contrast, go to many sources before you spew whatever pre-conceived notions you have. This prefabricated nonsense is what is leading us all into extreme positions. Yesterday’s bomber is undoubtedly a Trump support but his actions would never be endorsed by any thinking feeling person regardless of who you cast your vote for. Just stop it folks. Or it will continue and worsen and then people will feel compelled to pick sides and that is not my USA. Listen, consider and learn. Nobody from any party can claim this. All of us must claim this. All of us must do something to stop it. Very well stated. It’s a travesty, but let’s not point fingers and blame parties. This is a sick/twisted individual. Condolences to those affected. Robert Bowers avenged Gaza, thank you sir So the libs have already tagged the mail bomber as the “MAGA bomber”, so this guy should be called the DNC bomber, right? One only has to look at his tweets and his facebook page to see he is a liberal nut job. So, using the litmus test that the Democrats use, the mail bomber indicts all Republicans and conservatives and the DNC bomber indicts all Democrats and liberals, right? What is good for the goose is good for the gander. you people care about being right and winning more than each other. that’s the most significant problem i can see from the UK. This is why gun laws should be loosened. SO PEOPLE CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES. He has already been identified at other sites as being a “Trump Hater.” Hmm, no mention, not the same kind of headline as “MAGAbomber” i guess. Riighhht. THE JEWISH QUESTION Here is the answer The Book of Revelation – copied from Egyptian mystery religion texts (you can look it up) and spliced with Biblical imagery – a false prophecy. Blood letting, poisoning the wells. It’s history now. It’s the fear of God + superstition + peer pressure. This book inverts the teachings of Christ. It makes people predictable, psychopathic – readable. It’s been used for centuries to divide and manipulate populations. It’s been used as a war tactic for social and political domination. My Twitter page tells the full story. @ChrisGrinnin Trump hater? Obviously, anti-Trump rhetoric from the media (CNN, ABC, CBS, NYT), Obama, Clinton, Pelosi, Shumer, Waters, Soros and others are responsible for this slaughter right? Look who was held responsible for Cesar Sayoc Jr mailing dud pipe bombs! Agreed, this animal needs hanged, immediately. He’s already had his trial, he was caught red handed! Louis Farrakhan darling of CNN/MSLSD says stuff that is real bad against Jews. Al Sharpton another daring of the left.. Enough of the “he’s one of yours”, “Nuh-Uh, he’s another crazy winger!!, You own this!!” Blah-blah BS. The truth is, these people are insane, period. These people are crazy first, and their interpretation of whatever ideology they think they belong to is so perverted by their altered mental state as to be unrecognizable by rational people. They “belong” to no group, no side and no political ideology. They are dangerous and must be rooted out and stopped by a vigilant society before they commit violence. Any group who seeks to capitalize on tragedies like these to push their political ideology may actually share these people’s psychosis. what part of nationalist vs national socialist (nazi) don’t you ignorant @$$hat demonrats understand?!?!?!?!? this is what happens when liars just keep lying to cover all their previous lies…. it called a delusion!!!! turned over to a STRONG delusion, living in a world founded on LIES!!!! Why isn’t he being declared an enemy combatant and put on a plane to Gitmo? Oh my God! Jeff Sessions is alive!!!!!!!!! The Republicans are going to lose this year. So they will in 2020 as well. Get used to right wing conservative usually religiously and racially motivated attacks. I just can’t understand anti-semitism. I worked with many Jewish people in my life. I found most of them to be warm and friendly. Not the demons that these crazies believe. Get to know a group before you demonize them. I’m waiting patiently for journalists on CNN to explain which Democrat politician we need to blame for the acts of this insane — and Trump-hating — thug. *Crickets* Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment: You are commenting using your Google+ account.

Click to Enlarge Dear Tom, Why is the temperature at Midway Airport usually higher than at O’Hare International Airport, even though the two airports are only a few miles apart? — Mark Gaffney, St. Charles Dear Mark, It’s true that Midway Airport usually reports higher temperatures than O’Hare International Airport. It’s because of the “urban heat island effect” of metropolitan Chicago. Metropolitan areas, especially large ones like metropolitan Chicago, have many sources of generated heat. Buildings, heated in the winter and cooled by air conditioning during the summer, release a great deal of heat into th... FLOSSMOOR, Ill. — A 16-year-old student has been charged with a felony for making threats against Homewood-Flossmoor High School Saturday morning, according to a statement from the Flossmoor Police Department.

Kane, who entered with an NHL-leading 11 goals... CHICAGO - At this point, Bears fans won't complain, especially with two of their best players out with injuries. The game was far from pretty, and there is a lot to improve, but the team was able to snap a two-game losing streak with a victory over the Jets at Soldier Field. Frequent Sports Feed guest Robert Zeglinski was back on the show to discuss what went down at Soldier Field on Sunday afternoon at Soldier Field. That included the play of Mitchell Trubisky and the rest of the offense without Allen Robinson and the defense's performance without Khalil Mack. You can see his discussion wi... CHICAGO - They didn't have Khalil Mack or Allen Robinson, but the Bears will still have themselves a victory Monday. Thanks to a strong defense and opportunistic offense, the Bears beat the Jets 24-10 at Soldier Field on Sunday, snapping a two-game losing streak in the process. Was it perfect? No, and there is plenty for the team to correct, but after a few weeks of bad losses, Matt Nagy's team made sure this second half lead wouldn't get away. Lauren Magiera watched the game along with Jarrett Payton at Soldier Field, and together they discussed the contest on Sports Feed from the stadium ...

BROOKFIELD, Ill. — The annual Boo Bash brings fun special treats to Brookfield Zoo, including a haunted cowboy carousel, crazy corn maze and hundreds of carved pumpkins, some weighing as much as 2000 pounds.

And no Halloween celebration would be complete without an opportunity to smash some pumpkins, which are given the animals as tasty fall snacks. WGN's Andrea Darlas has more on the fun at the zoo.

The mother was screaming, the young girl wh... CHICAGO – It was a dreary, drizzly, windy day fitting of the Halloween weekend at Soldier Field on Sunday, and a few things were cloudy about the Bears. Khalil Mack was indeed held out of the game to help an injured ankle heel, with Allen Robinson joining him on the sidelines as he nursed a groin injury. Each new Bears player had major contributions to the team, and now they’d have to stop a two-game losing streak without them. Despite the fact their play was at times as dreary as the weather, the Bears had just enough in them to win without two of their top guys. The Bears defense held ro... NEW YORK — Michael Meyers — or is it Jamie Lee Curtis? — can’t be stopped. “Halloween” dominated the North American box office for the second straight weekend, carving up an estimated $32 million in ticket sales. The top four films were all unchanged at the North American box office, according to Sunday estimates, as Hollywood left “Halloween” to dominate the pre-trick-or-treating weekend.

Authorities have since confirmed they found human remains inside a barrel — and that the remains have positively been identified as Tucker...

LaVine had 27 points and a career-high 11 rebounds, and the Bulls went 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter to pull away for a 97-85 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. One night earlier, the Bulls were embarrassed 135-106 at Charlotte. “It’s good to get a win,” said LaVine, who has led the Bulls in scoring in all six games. “I was upset with the effort that we gave (Friday).” Jabari Parker scored half of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for the Bulls, who struggled from lo...

A group is accusing Curran of covering up details surrounding Robinson’s death. The sheriff said he’s done everything to be transparent — and that Saturday's protest is political theater ahead of next month's election.

There were no signs of tra... CHICAGO — Enrollment at Chicago’s public schools fell by 10,000 a year after the district reported a drop of 11,000 students. The Chicago Tribune reports that the last two years continue a trend of steadily declining enrollment that started 15 years ago. But the drop to a total of just over 361,000 students won’t hurt the budgets of schools as much as previous declines have because the CPS opted this year to base school budgets on enrollment counts from the last school year rather than this year’s 20th day of classes. Still, 54 schools that requested “funding advances” based on anticipated ... CHICAGO — A man tried to lure a 14-year-old boy waiting for a bus in South Shore this week, police said.

Samuel Popeil's son, Ron Popeil, who founded Ronco Inventions and popularly marketed the device, is still alive.

His story asserted that Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to be the next CIA director, played a role in the treatment of al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah during interrogations at a "black site" in Thailand and that she had "mocked" Zubaydah. On March 15, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology. Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment. During this report, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.

It's Trunk Island on St. John, not Magens Bay on St. Thomas. Additionally, Andrew Clutz's name was misspelled as Klutz. A previous version of this story misspelled Nielsen as Nielson in some references. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the affected area was 104 feet by 328 feet. The area is 164 feet by 328 feet. A previous version of this report misidentified the business partner of Paul Manafort who was charged with conspiracy and money laundering. He is Rick Gates, not Carter Page. An earlier version of this story said the suit was filed for eight plaintiffs who were detained and one who was deported. The eight plaintiffs include the person who was deported. A caption on a previous version of this story said the crash site was south of Charlottesville. It is 12 miles west. An earlier version of this story referred to the Drug Enforcement Administration as the Drug Enforcement Agency. A previous version of this story misidentifed Adrienne Keene as Adrienne King. Nanga Parbat was first summited during winter in 2016, not 2014 as a previous version of this post said. In the audio of this story, as in a previous Web version, we say the Station F space covers 110,000 square feet. In fact, it's 366,000 square feet.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program will end next month. The actual date is March 5. A headline on a previous version of this story incorrectly referred to seagrass as seaweed. In the interview, Thomas Homan said ICE "will not turn a blind eye to somebody that we find during our enforcement operations that's in the country illegally." A previous version of the transcript was incorrect. He did not say "in the country legally." A previous version of this story located Hue as just north of Saigon. It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.  An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Cassio and Lepidus were characters in Julius Caesar. In fact, Cassio appears in Othello and Lepidus in Antony and Cleopatra, where his drinking becomes an issue, as well as in Julius Caesar. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we incorrectly say that at least 16 people were shot in addition to the two fatalities. Not all of those who were injured were shot. A previous version of this story misidentified the author as Richard Harris. He is Robert Harris. A previous version of this story misstated the name of a Casey Affleck movie as I'm Not There. The correct title is I'm Still Here. An earlier version of this story misidentified Alan Trammell as Jack Trammell. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Spider-Man 2 was only nominated for sound mixing and visual effects. In fact, it won for visual effects and was nominated for both sound mixing and sound editing. In addition, the story also said The Incredibles won for best animated feature in 2004. The movie was released in 2004 but won its Oscar in 2005. Also, the story said The Dark Knight was passed over for best picture in 2008. The movie came out in 2008, but the nominations and awards show were in 2009. In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses. Previously posted on Jan. 8: We say that Irish voters elected a gay, biracial prime minister. In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election — and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Larry Nassar's sentence was handed down on Tuesday. It was Wednesday. Additionally, we previously said Nassar's statement to victims came after his sentence was announced. It came before the sentence. A previous version of this post referred to Helle Thorning-Schmidt as the former Dutch prime minister. In fact, she was the prime minister of Denmark.

In this report we say that roughly 100 people are losing their DACA status per week. We should have said per day. A previous photo caption misspelled Rafael Mercedes' first name as Raphael.

A previous version of this story misspelled Realtor Tanya Gersh's first name as Tonya in one instance. A previous version of this post incorrectly referred to the band Ladysmith Black Mambazo as Ladyship Black Mambozo. A previous version of this Web story said Three Day Rule's database of singles came from partnerships with online dating sites. The company's singles database is separate from its online dating site partnerships. Previous audio and Web versions of this story suggested that Americans are no longer legally required to buy health insurance. That's incorrect. The individual mandate to buy health insurance that was part of the Affordable Care Act — requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face a financial penalty — is still in effect until 2019. Additionally, former President Barack Obama's first name was misspelled as Barak. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly referred to the movie In the Fade as Into the Fade. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Dylan O'Riordan was brought to the U.S. on a visitor's visa. He came under the visa waiver program.

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to five days to keep the government running. Van Hollen said they would support a stopgap measure of three to four days. Additionally, Mitch McConnell was incorrectly identified as the Senate minority leader. He is the majority leader. An earlier Web version of this story quoted Bob Bland as saying Nevada voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in 2016. Nevada is a longtime swing state that went to Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. A previous version of this story stated that Americans will burn 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel made from soybean oil this year. In fact, some of that biodiesel will be made from other oils, including corn oil, canola oil and recycled cooking oil. A previous Web introduction to this story incorrectly stated that Matthew Kluger was a professor at George Mason University. He is a professor at Northwestern University. An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the DACA program will end in March 2017. The correct date for the end of the program is March 2018, absent a new law codifying it or a further delay of its termination by the Trump administration. A previous version of this story misspelled James Toback's last name as Torbeck. In this story, we say that two members of Congress, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, have resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, Rep. Trent Franks also resigned, for a total of three. A previous version of this story described Straight, No Chaser as a Clint Eastwood film. Charlotte Zwerin directed the film. Eastwood produced it. A previous Web and audio version of this story said the sale of Fiona-related items generated about $3 million for the zoo. However, the $2 million to $3 million number refers to the estimated boost to the local economy from the Fiona-related sales and tourism. We say President Trump's cognitive test took 30 minutes to complete. In fact, the White House physician did not say how long the test lasted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment typically takes about 10 minutes. Saxophonist Lester Young did perform with Benny Goodman on the Carnegie Hall stage in 1938, but the saxophone solo during "One O'Clock Jump" that is heard in this story was played by Babe Russin. A previous version of this story said Russell M. Nelson has 116 grandchildren. In fact, Nelson has 116 great-grandchildren. Additionally, we also quoted Russell M. Nelson as saying, "Two days ago, my brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles laid hands upon my hands." In fact, Nelson said "laid hands upon my head." A previous version of this story incorrectly said Michael Bond died in 2016. He died in 2017. A previous headline incorrectly said that the Great Recession led to fewer deaths among the unemployed. In fact, the decline in mortality is not limited to the unemployed. An earlier version of this story misspelled Johnathon Shillings' first name as Johnathan. A previous photo caption in this story said Ben and Tara were married in 2014 and Ben was diagnosed two years later. They were actually married in 2015 and Ben was diagnosed in 2016. A previous version of this story was missing the 12:30 a.m. time stamp, when investigators noted that the privacy settings on Marilou Danley's Facebook account had been changed.

A previous version of this story misspelled the surname of Cornell researcher Alan Hedge as Hedges. A previous version of this story incorrectly gave Xavier Becerra's first name as Javier.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said that the only field test of the 2020 census questions is set to begin in April in Rhode Island's Providence County. The Census Bureau has conducted previous tests of potential questions, and participants in Providence County can take part in the last scheduled field test beginning in March. A previous version of this story misspelled Timothy Piazza's last name as Piazzaz. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we say historian Danielle McGuire met Recy Taylor on President Barack Obama's Inauguration Day in 2008. The correct year is 2009. A previous version of this story referred to Dartmouth College as Dartmouth University. The audio of this story incorrectly states that Tonya Harding landed the first triple axel in Olympics competition history. In fact, Canada's Brian Orser was the first person to land the triple axel at the Olympics. A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of author Santino Hassell as Hassle. A previous version of this story misspelled Allen Ginsberg's last name as Ginsburg. An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to U. S. Customs and Border Patrol. The correct name of the agency is U.S. Customs and Border Protection. An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Daimler-Benz. The correct name of the company is Daimler. In a previous version of this story, a photo of the late astronaut Gene Cernan seen saluting the flag was misidentified as John Young. That photo has been replaced. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Steve Bannon had been the chairman of the Trump campaign. He was the CEO. A previous version of the Web story incorrectly stated that more than half of the nation's Latino population lives in Los Angeles. It should have said that in Los Angeles, about half of the population is Latino. A previous version of this story referred to Meghan Markle as a princess-to-be. In fact, she will not be known as Princess Meghan. It is more likely that the queen will make Prince Harry a duke and Markle will become a duchess. A previous version of this story said Iceland has had a law against pay discrimination since 1963; in fact, the law passed in 1961. A previous headline misstated the title of the film as In The Land Of The Pomegranates; the correct title has no second "the." Also, because of an error in the press materials, Hava Kohav Beller's first name was misspelled as Hova. A previous version of this story said the Dow rose 4,000 points over the last four months. It rose by that amount over the last 10 months. This post has been updated to include comments from Mark Memmott. A previous caption misidentified Interstate 16 as Interstate 26. The audio of this story describes Papa, Jake and Kevin as elementary school students. They're actually eighth-graders, but in Chicago, kindergarten through eighth grade is referred to as elementary school. A previous version of this story said Republican Joshua Cole was certified as the winner in District 28. In fact, Republican Robert Thomas was certified as the winner. Cole is a Democrat. A previous version of this story misspelled the name of music publisher Wixen as Wixin. An earlier Web version of this story credited some information to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. The information came from the American Veterinary Medical Association. During this conversation, we mistakenly say that The New York Times reported George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat about a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. In fact, the Times reported that Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had collected potentially damaging information about Democratic political candidate Hillary Clinton. An earlier transcript referred to Luxembourg for Finance as a government bank. In fact, it is the agency for the development of the Luxembourg financial center. A previous version of this story said that if Mitt Romney ran for Senate from Utah, it would be his first run for Congress. Romney ran for Senate in 1994, losing to Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy. Additionally, Orrin Hatch and Thad Cochran were incorrectly referred to as Senate pro tempore. The correct term is president pro tempore. The original story incorrectly stated that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida came in second place in the 2016 Utah GOP caucuses. It was Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published. A correction posted here on Feb. 22 has been removed because it mistakenly stated that President Reagan signed that commission into law. In fact, it was President Carter. An earlier version of this story identified Sarah Broderick as CEO/CFO of Vice. She is COO/CFO. In previous audio and a Web introduction for this page, we said President Trump named Jerusalem the capital of Israel. In fact, he didn't name it as the capital; he said the U.S. would recognize it as the capital. In this story, Nikki Haley is described incorrectly as the U.S. ambassador to the United States. In fact, she is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. A previous Web version of this story misstated the name of Oxford American's deputy editor. He is Maxwell George, not George Maxwell. On an earlier Web page, puzzle winner Nick England was mistakenly referred to as Nick English. A previous version of the recipe for Friendship Bread incorrectly called for 25 ounces of active yeast. The correct amount is 0.25 ounces — or 2 1/4 teaspoons. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

---split---9.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-responding-active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue/story?id=58790381---split---Eleven people were killed and at least six more were injured -- including four police officers -- when a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, authorities said. "It's a very horrific crime scene," Alleghany Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters during the press conference Saturday afternoon. "It's one of the worst that I've seen." Police responded earlier Saturday to reports of active gunfire at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha congregation, where a service was taking place, Hissrich said. The suspect is in custody and has been taken to the hospital, Hissrich said. Eight men and three women were killed in the shooting, according to a criminal complaint. One of the four officers is in critical condition. The shooter has been identified as Robert Bowers, who is 46 years old and lives in Pittsburgh. Bowers use at least one assault rifle in the shooting and had three handguns on him. Bowers was charged with 29 federal counts late Saturday, including several hate crimes. He is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious belief resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The four counts of bodily injury to a public safety officer stem from the police officers injured in the shooting. Bowers was not known to the FBI before Saturday, Bob Jones, the agency's special agent in charge, said during a press conference Saturday afternoon. He is believed to have acted alone, Jones added.   He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in fair condition at a local hospital, Hissrich said. In addition to the federal charges, Bowers was also charged with 35 state offenses, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of criminal attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.   The congregants were attending a baby-naming ceremony in the synagogue, Pennsylvania's state attorney general told the Associated Press. There were no children among the dead, Hissrich said. Jennifer Paddy said her daughter, who was staying at a friend's house near the synagogue, "heard rapid gunfire." "Her and her friend ... they ran downstairs and barricaded themselves in the basement," she told ABC affiliate WTAE in Pittsburgh. Since the incident happened at a synagogue, it is being treated as a federal hate crime and will be handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the assistance of local, county and state police, he added.   The Anti-Defamation League said it was "unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning." "This is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States," it said in a statement. First responders prevented the shooting from becoming a worse tragedy, and the injured have been taken to three area hospitals with level one trauma centers, Hissrich said. "Without their courage, this tragedy would have been far worse," said Hissrich said. Rabbi Alvin Berkun, who was not at the synagogue at the time, told ABC News he was "stunned" and "sorry" to hear of the shooting. He said he had stayed home from services Saturday morning because his wife was sick and that he has not heard from friends who were in the building.   Berkun, who lives nearby the synagogue, said police officers came to his door and told him to stay inside his home. He described the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, where the synagogue is located, as "a very Jewish neighborhood" which is "known as a Jewish community." "There's absolutely no crime, it's an amazing neighborhood," Berkun said. "It's hard to believe it's a city neighborhood. It's dominated by the Jewish community center four blocks away ... by kosher bakeries -- all kinds of Jewish gift shops, bookshops, a number of synagogues." "There is one major synagogue but there are at least five other synagogues within two miles of where we are," he said.   When the gunman opened fire at the synagogue, law enforcement officers, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) swiftly responded to the scene. The suspect was apprehended a short time later. The synagogue is a conservative Jewish congregation, according to its website, and there was a morning Shabbat service scheduled from 9:45 a.m. to noon.   Berkun said there are "three different religious groups that are meeting in our building on Saturday morning with three distinct services," estimating that there could have been approximately 75 people in the building at the time. Hissrich declined during the press conference to say how many people were inside at the time.   By late Saturday afternoon, with the death toll at 11, President Donald Trump signaled that he will change the tone of his typical rally speeches, telling reporters that "tone is very important." He said he was enthusiastic about being on the campaign trail, but that Saturday's mass shooting had changed things. "Tonight, I will absolutely change my tone," he said. Earlier, speaking to reporters before boarding a flight to the event in Indiana, Trump called the attack "a shame," calling the suspect "a wacko" and a "maniac." He also said the suspect should "pay the ultimate price" and be subjected to the death penalty. When asked about whether the nation's gun laws should be changed, Trump said the synagogue should have had armed security there. "You want protection, and they didn’t have any protection, they had a maniac walk in," Trump said. "The results could have been much better." He said that before getting into office, he would think "what a shame, what a shame" when incidents like this one unfolded. "It’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States and you have to watch this thing happen," Trump said. After he arrived Saturday afternoon, the president said the shooter appeared to be an "anti-Semitic crime." "That is something you wouldn't believe could still be going on," he added. After hinting earlier in the day that he might cancel Saturday night's rally out of respect for the dead and wounded in Pittsburgh, he told the crowd that he was inspired to attend the rally by the late New York Yankees' owner and friend George Steinbrenner -- and his resolve for the Yankees to play after the September 11th attacks in 2001. Trump also claimed that the US Stock Exchange remained open, though it was closed for six days after the attacks. Vice President Mike Pence offered his condolences on Twitter. "Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders,” he tweeted Saturday morning. "God bless them all."  Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all.  First lady Melania Trump said her "heart breaks" over the shooting, and that "the violence needs to stop."  My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted that he was headed to Pittsburgh.   "We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need," he wrote.  On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need.  By Saturday evening, residents of the Pittsburgh apartment building where Bowers lived who had been evacuated were allowed back into their apartments. One neighbor described the suspect to ABC News as a quiet loner who lived alone and didn't stick out as any sort of danger. The New York City Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department said that they are deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities as well. "The NYPD is deploying heavy weapons teams, including the officers from the Critical Response Command and the Strategic Response Team, to houses of worship across the City," the department said in a statement. "Additionally, sector cars in every command across New York City will be making additional visits to ensure the safety of all of our residents. Currently, there is no nexus to New York. But these steps are being taken until further information is learned about the events in Pittsburgh by the NYPD." Police in Washington, D.C., are also on alert. "We have reached out to Jewish community leaders and have directed officers to pay special attention to synagogues until further notice," a spokesperson for the D.C. police department said.

---split---9.0---split---https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fox-business-pulls-lou-dobbs-episode-1203006635/---split---An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight. This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings,” said Gary Schreier, senior vice president of programming at the 21st Century Fox-owned network, in a statement. The decision comes after Dobbs posted — and then deleted — two different tweets last week suggested recent bomb threat made to media outlets and Democrats were false. On Thursday’s broadcast, Chris Farrell, a director of Judicial Watch, a conservative activist and watchdog group that investigates misconduct by government officials, suggested a caravan of migrants that has been traveling through South America to Mexico — and has been cited by President Donald Trump as a potential threat to the United States — was being funded by billionaire George Soros. Citations like that are typically meant to allude to Jews.   The broadcast did not get much reaction upon its original airing on Thursday, but after it re-ran Saturday night, it sparked new outrage on Twitter and social media. Many TV viewers were focused on the killing of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Farrell is expected to no longer be booked to appear on Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network. Producers and anchors at the two cable networks that make up the Fox News unit at 21st Century Fox have been under orders to be mindful of “protecting the talent, protecting the brand,”since June of 2018. At the time, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott urged employees to clamp down on remarks and rhetoric that undermined the programming. Fox News has at times featured guests and hosts dismissing an account of a girl with Down’s Syndrome; taking aim at one of the high school students involved in the shooting tragedy in Parkland, Florida; and telling an African-American Democratic strategist that he was “out of his cotton-picking mind.” Dobbs has enjoyed a second career of sorts at Fox Business, where he has been since 2011 after working at CNN for more than two decades in senior roles and as anchor of “Moneyline” and an earlier edition of “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” At Fox, his program airs at 7 p.m., and has become newly instrumental as a feeder of audience to a new Fox Business primetime lineup featuring Trish Regan and Kennedy. Fox Business has placed a new emphasis on live primetime programming. For a period of time, the network used pre-taped shows after 8 p.m.  An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] An executive from Fox Business Network said the cable outlet would pull from rotation a recent broadcast of “Lou Dobbs Tonight” featuring a guest making remarks about a “Soros-occupied State Department” that has spurred social-media pushback in the wake of Saturday’s shooting tragedy at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on […] © Copyright 2018 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC.

---split---10.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-north-valley-shooting-20181028-story.html---split---Loren Lieb and Donna Finkelstein were on their way to Lancaster on Saturday to campaign against a congressional candidate who opposes strict gun control laws when the two women received a call with news about a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Eleven people were killed and six injured, in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history. The two longtime friends were stunned. “When is something going to change?” Lieb wondered. The women bonded nearly 20 years ago after another tragic incident in which a self-professed white supremacist walked into the North Valley Jewish Community Center armed with a semiautomatic weapon and began shooting. Lieb’s 6-year-old son and Finkelstein’s 16-year-old daughter were among the five people wounded. Since then, Lieb and Finkelstein have become involved with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and are board members of Women Against Gun Violence. “We have a special bond,” Finkelstein said. “We both took this tragic shooting and we became activists. We know that we do whatever we can to prevent future gun violence.” The mothers had never met before the Aug. 10, 1999, shooting at the community center. Finkelstein’s daughter, Mindy, was a counselor and Lieb’s son, Josh Stepakoff, was attending summer day camp. That morning, Josh had just finished a game of “capture the flag” and was walking down the main corridor of the community center when he came face-to-face with a person he thought was a construction worker. The man turned out to be the shooter, Buford Furrow Jr. Of the five people wounded that day, three were children ages 5 and 6. After the rampage, Furrow left the center and fatally shot a mail carrier in Chatsworth. Furrow is currently serving a life sentence. Although Josh was shot in the leg and the hip, he remembers only running. Mindy was with another camper when she was shot twice and managed to escape with the child. On Saturday morning, Mindy Finkelstein was in bed with her 7-month-old daughter and her husband in the Bay Area when she received texts from family members asking if she’d heard about the Pittsburgh shooting. As she watched the news, she felt “an overwhelming sense of survivor’s guilt.” “I also had a deeper sense of sadness that not much has changed in almost 20 years and actually, now more than ever, gun violence and hate are more prevalent than they were when I was shot,” she said. Now 35, Mindy criticized the easy accessibility to guns, as well as the sheer power of the weapons available. Saturday’s shooting unfolded over 20 minutes at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, known locally for being the historical hub of the city’s Jewish community. The gunman, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, officials said. During negotiations for Bowers’ surrender, an officer at the scene radioed that Bowers was saying that “all these Jews need to die.” He was charged late Saturday on 29 counts, including 11 counts of murder with a firearm, and several hate crime charges such as obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. The Anti-Defamation League reported earlier this year that "anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. rose 57% in 2017 — the largest single-year increase on record and the second-highest number reported since ADL started tracking such data in 1979." Mindy’s daughter is growing up Jewish and she said she wants her “to be proud of that.” “I don’t want her to shy away from it or hide it and I don’t want to hide it. I want to be proud of my heritage,” Mindy said. “The leaders of this country have a responsibility to make it known that this hate that is being spewed out everywhere is wrong and it’s actually killing people.” President Trump, in his first comment to reporters on the shooting, called for armed guards at synagogues and implied that lax security by the synagogue was at least partially to blame for the high death toll. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better," he said. "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him, frankly.” After the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting, the center installed gates, a guard shack and an armed security guard who worked around the clock, all of which came at a huge financial cost to the organization, according to Nina Lieberman, who oversaw the community center at the time. A Los Angeles police officer kept watch at the site for weeks. Lieberman’s 6-year-old son was enrolled in the summer camp and witnessed the shooting. The community center saw a small dip in enrollment after the shooting, said Lieberman, who was associate executive director of the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles at the time. It was a precursor to a bigger blow just a few years later when parents pulled their kids out of preschools and summer camps in large numbers after the 9/11 terrorist attacks out of fear of sending their children to Jewish centers. The drop in revenue played a significant role in causing a financial crisis for the organization, Lieberman said. The Granada Hills site was shuttered in the early 2000s and the land was sold. Members of the community later joined other groups and formed the Valley Jewish Community Center in Woodland Hills. Still, the tragedy in 1999 brought the greater community together, with preschool held the very next day at an Episcopal church next door, Lieberman said. “We made a very conscious decision to act like a community center and provide a sense of belonging,” she said. “We took it as an opportunity to create a sense of togetherness, to say, ‘We are not going to fall because of your behavior.’” After Donna Finkelstein’s husband called her Saturday with the news, she spent most of the day weeping. So did Lieb. The women would spend several hours together canvassing neighborhoods in Lancaster. As they knocked on each door, Finkelstein was fearful about what could happen. “Because you don’t know who has a gun,” Finkelstein said.

Murphy Robert Bowers’ anti-Semitism fueled other hate speech that he published and shared on Gab.com Bowers made anti-Semitic comments alongside xenophobic content, claiming that Jews were helping transport members of the migrant caravans in Latin America. He shared a video that another Gab.com user posted, purportedly of HIAS, a Jewish refugee support group, on the US-Mexico border. In another post, Bowers described HIAS' overall efforts as, "sugar-coated evil." He believed that those in the migrant caravans were violent because they were attempting to leave countries that had high levels of violence. And Bowers repeatedly called them “invaders.” “I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders',” read one post, six days before the shooting. “I like this.” At 9:49 a.m., in his final post on Gab.com, Bowers said referenced HIAS, saying he believed they brought in “invaders,” that were killing his people. From AnneClaire Stapleton Of the 6 people injured at the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, four were police officers, officials said. Don Yealy, Chief of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, detailed the 6 injuries and said two are in critical condition. From Paul P. Murphy The suspect's final ominous post on social media came only five minutes before police were alerted to a mass shooting that left 11 people dead at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh Among many anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant posts on his Gab social media profile, Robert Bowers posted a final one at 9:49 a.m. complaining about a Jewish organization that aids refugees. “I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” he wrote. “Screw your optics, I'm going in.” The first call to police came minutes later, at 9:54 a.m. From AnneClaire Stapleton The suspect Robert Bowers is a Pittsburgh resident, and an assault rifle and three handguns were found on the scene, officials said. He is in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds, said Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh's public safety director. Criminal charges are expected shortly, possibly even today, said Scott W. Brady, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  From Eli Watkins President Donald Trump said he will hold a political rally in Illinois as planned. The Saturday afternoon rally in Murphysboro, Illinois, will follow a stop in Indianapolis, Indiana, for an agriculture convention. Reporters were told ahead of Trump's remarks in Indianapolis that he might cancel the Illinois stop because of the synagogue shooting, but Trump said at the convention that he did not want to "let people that are evil change our lives." "So I think when I'm finished with this, I should go to Illinois," Trump said. "I will go to Illinois, and we'll keep our schedule the way it's supposed to be, and we should all do that, and I maybe recommend that to others also." From AnneClaire Stapleton The shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue left 11 people dead and six people injured, said Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. Four of the six injured people were law enforcement officers, he said. No children were killed in the shooting. The injured does not include the shooter. Bob Jones, FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge, said it was the “most horrific crime scene” he’s seen. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime, Gov. Tom Wolf said. From Paul P. Murphy Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, posted photos on September 29 of his handgun collection to his Gab.com account, which included multiple clips and sights. On September 20, Bowers posted photos of shooting targets from what he says is from July 2017. Bowers said he was firing at the targets with a Walther PPQ.  Gab is a social media platform that advocates for free speech and puts nearly no restrictions on content. Shortly before the shooting, Bowers posted on his Gab account that he “can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” From Jay Croft Jewish people were the victims of more reported hate crimes than any other religious minority in 2016, according to the most recent year of FBI statistics. In that year, 684 anti-Jewish incidents were reported. That's more than the rest of religiously motivated hate crimes combined, records reveal. The FBI showed an overall increase in reported hate crimes of more than 4% from 2015 to 2016. Anti-Islamic (anti-Muslim) crimes accounted for 307, up 19% from the previous year. That was the biggest percentage rise. You can read about the hate-crime statistics here.  A number of rampage shootings have targeted synagogues, churches and other places of worship in recent years.

---split---10.0---split---https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/10/27/heavy-police-presence-near-synagogue-in-squirrel-hill/---split---Follow KDKA-TV: Facebook | Twitter PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – Eleven people have been killed and a number of others injured after a shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill on Saturday. Police sources tell KDKA’s Andy Sheehan the gunman, Robert Bowers, walked into the building and yelled, “All Jews must die.” Sheehan’s sources also confirmed that eleven people have died. No children are among the deceased. Bowers was reportedly armed with an AR-15 and three handguns. (Photo Credit: Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) The initial call to 911 was made around 9:54 a.m. and officers were dispatched to the scene within a minute. Two officers arrived on the scene and observed a male who was carrying an assault-style weapon, according to police. Bowers opened fire on the two officers and then retreated back into the building. One of the officers suffered a gunshot wound to the hand and the other officer received several cuts to his face from shrapnel and broken glass. RELATED LINKS: Pittsburgh SWAT officers arrived on scene, formed a small team and entered the building. Upon entering the building officers observed the devestation. SWAT medics carried two victims, one male and one female, outside of the building. The victims were transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. Officers began searching the third floor of the synagogue when they encountered Bowers again, who opened fire on the SWAT team. One officer was shot multiple times and critically wounded and another officer was also shot multiple times by Bowers. The remaining SWAT officers engaged Bowers while the two injured officers were carried outside to Pittsburgh Paramedics. Bowers was injured in the exchange of gunfire. After being taken into custody, the suspect made statements to an officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide on his people, according to authorities. It is believed that Bowers acted alone. (Photo Credit: KDKA Photojournalist Tim Lawson)  “I will emphasize at this time that there appears to be no active threat to the community. We believe the subject that is responsible for this has been taken into custody,” Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. Hissrich said at least six other people were injured, including several police officers. Two of the officers were among the first responders to the scene. At least one other was a member of the SWAT team. WATCH: Officials Hold Press Conference To Update Investigation: As of 5:30 p.m., three victims — a 61-year-old woman, a 55-year-old man, and a 27-year-old male officer — were in stable condition. Two victims — a 70-year-old man and a 40-year-old male SWAT officer — were in critical condition. One additional officer was treated and released. UPDATE AS OF 5:30 PM ON SATURDAY, OCT. 27, 2018: A 61-year-old female is in stable condition. A 70-year-old male is in critical condition. A 55-year-old male officer is in stable condition. More ⬇️. pic.twitter.com/KfHfqb2Dut — UPMC (@UPMCnews) October 27, 2018 Another person was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. According to multiple sources, that person is the suspect in the shooting. The suspect was reportedly shot multiple times and was last listed in fair condition. The shooting happened during weekly Shabbat services at the synagogue. The building was full of people for a Saturday service and police said they received several calls from people barricaded inside. A heavy police presence blocked off a section of McAnulty Road in Baldwin Borough. It is believed Bowers lived in an apartment in that area. Police were in the process of obtaining a search warrant for the residence. Police are also investigating if Bowers announced his intentions on social media Saturday morning. That account has since been taken down.  One posting stated, “HIAS [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill out people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Hissrich said this shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and as such, the FBI is leading the investigation. “At this time this is being considered a federal violation and the primary investigative agency will be the Federal Bureau of investigation,” Hissrich said. “As the mayor mentioned, we’ve had a tragedy here today. The work of the first responders is what probably prevented it from becoming much more of a tragedy for what it is,” Hissrich said. (Photo Credit: KDKA) District attorney spokesman Mike Manko issued the following statement: “Senior prosecutors and detectives from our office have been monitoring this atrocity since the first reports. A deputy district attorney is on site and is coordinating the prosecution of this individual under state laws involving murder and federal laws involving domestic terrorism. District Attorney Zappala has been in touch with United States Attorney Scott Brady and as this progresses, they will work together to determine the appropriate forum in which to address these crimes. As we always do, we want to allow the families and survivors of this heinous and abhorrent act, and the Jewish Community of Pittsburgh, the time they need to grieve their loss. During this time, the investigation, led by the FBI, will continue and as we did following the murders committed by Richard Baumhammers, we will have a process evaluating the safety and potential vulnerabilities of synagogues, churches and schools. To that end, we have already reached out to leaders of the Jewish community as well as other leaders in the religious and educational community.” Federal charges were filed Saturday evening. Those charges include: Eleven counts each of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Death and Use of a Firearm to Commit Murder During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence, four counts of Obstruction of Exercise of Religious Beliefs Resulting in Bodily Injury to a Public Safety Officer and three counts of Use and Discharge of a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the charges filed could lead to the death penalty. A phone number has been established for any questions from family members of the victims. That number is (412)-432-4400. A victims’ assistance and reunification center has also been set up on the campus of Chatham University. Grief counselors and representatives from the Red Cross will be on hand. (Photo Credit: KDKA) Thousands filled the streets of Squirrel Hill for a vigil Saturday evening. “That’s what makes Squirrel Hill such a great neighborhood. It’s probably one of the most diverse in not only the city, but across the state. This hits home to everyone. We saw people from different religions, ethnicities, they’re all gathering doing vigils,” Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O’Connor said. A GoFundMe page has also been set up to benefit the victims, their families and the synagogue. If you would like to donate, click here. Meanwhile, KDKA-TV spoke with several people familiar with what services would have been taking place on a normal Saturday morning. “At 9:45 there were three simultaneous congregations’ services that were being held,” he said. “In the main part of the building, The Tree of Life has a service that has about 40 people in it. Just below that there is a basement area where New Life congregation would have been having their Shabbat service. There would have been 30-40 people. Just adjacent to Tree of Light’s service area, a congregation was in the rabbi study room and they would have had approximately 15 people in there,” Michael Eisenberg, the past President of the Tree of Life, said. Chuck Diamond was a rabbi at Tree of Life for seven years. Diamond said possibly three rabbis would’ve been inside. Rabbi Pearlman from New Light was in the basement. Rabbi Cheryl Kline was in the social hall. Rabbi Meyers, the rabbi of Tree of Life, would have been in the chapel. “I was at home [when I found out]. I live right up the street around the corner and I started getting phone calls,” Diamond said. Meghan Schiller: Did you ever as rabbi think that you were gonna have to deal with this? Diamond: “I thought about it all the time, I have to tell you. When I was there, in the back of my mind, I always have the thought of something like this happening and what I would do, unfortunately, because of the world we live in.” Schiller: “What comes to mind when you hear that President Donald Trump just tweeted about this?” Diamond: “Well again, this is unfortunately it happens too often in this country and around the world that these things happen, so it affects us all, so I’m glad that he tweeted something and hopefully he’ll take positive action.” President Donald Trump called the shooting a “terrible thing” and said “it’s a shame to watch.” “It’s a terrible terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country, and frankly all over the world and something has be done,” Trump said. “It’s just a shame to watch this and to see it for so many years, so much of it, it’s a shame.” Earlier, Trump tweeted his thoughts to the Pittsburgh area amid the tragedy. Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018 Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018 Trump was asked about revisiting gun laws and said if those inside had protection, “maybe it could have been a much different situation.” “This has little to do with it. If they had protection inside the results would have been far better. This is a dispute that will always exist I suspect. But if they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a much different situation. But they didn’t and he was able to do things that unfortunately he shouldn’t have been able to do,” Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said today’s shooting wasn’t just a criminal act, it was evil. “What happened in Pittsburgh today was not just criminal, it was evil. An attack on innocent Americans and an assault on our freedom of religion. There is no place in America for violence or anti-Semitism and this evil must end,” Pence said. Meanwhile, Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered all commonwealth flags on the Capitol Complex, at commonwealth facilities, and throughout the state lowered to half-staff, effective immediately, in honor of all victims of the attack. He also issued the following statement regarding the incident: “The shooting in Pittsburgh this morning is an absolute tragedy. I have spoken with local leaders and my administration and the Pennsylvania State Police will provide any resources to assist local law enforcement and first responders. “These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way. “And in the aftermath of this tragedy, we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future. We cannot accept this violence as normal.” Two of Pittsburgh’s professional sports teams, the Steelers and Penguins, also Tweeted their thoughts and prayers to the victims. We send our thoughts and prayers to those affected by this morning’s tragedy in Pittsburgh. We will continue to pray for everyone involved. — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) October 27, 2018 We are incredibly saddened to hear of this morning’s tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. We send our thoughts and prayers to all those affected. — Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) October 27, 2018 Stay with KDKA.com for this developing story. Have the deep, fake news media linked this shooter to President Trump or the Tea Party yet? Nope, but some trolls here are on the job! I thought that it was a foregone conclusion the NRAs responsible. Yep. They’ve tried. Either Islamo-Animals or Neo Nazi’s. The safe bet is on this being Muslim. During these days of increasing political violence we need to be armed for self defense. Many places of worship have armed members as security. So far no indication that this was done here. There are a number of cases where armed members stopped a killer. It is a sad fact that the police are minutes away when seconds count. Sorrow for those fallen. Madmen exist among us far and wide. Open carry may be the solution til Criminal Psychopaths respect law and order….and reopen Psych wards closed during the last few decades for 90 day, court ordered evaluation. There was a time when a mass shooting of this magnitude would have locked our nation’s attention. Not that we ever did anything about it beyond useless thoughts and prayers, but we at least took a passing look at it. Now it’s just another story, on Saturday morning. I feel so terrible for the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this (yet another) act of senseless violence. The comments on this thread are a shame – people are DEAD – whether you are right wing or left wing. Someone’s sister, brother, son, daughter, father, etc…Their relatives lives just stopped and they will have to bear this the rest of their days. We need to stop this incessant blaming. Our society has become nothing but hatred and yes this is the result. For one moment can we just bow our heads and pray? Sheeeyeah. ‘Better ask James Hodgkisson about that. Dems are RAH’thn STINKing commie statists. Yes, Bugsy we can and I stand with you in prayer. Thank you for your comment. 8 people are dead and the devastation to them and their families is really what is important here. Is good to see a compassionate voice in the comments after such an atrocity, Jews worshiping on Sabbath gunned down by a madman full of hate and evil. May God’s angels of comfort and peace surround all of the victim’s families and may fellow Americans and human beings have compassion for the victims and their families. In Jesus’ Name AMEN. The problem is that, as disgusting as it may seem, the left uses every opportunity, and will use this one, to advance their political agenda. Many of us are just anticipating it. Muslim or neo-Nazi …. either way, FRY HIM!! We cannot vote these xenophobic, racist misogynists out fast enough. Here’s to dems getting enough votes that Republicans can’t cheat themselves into another year of majority rule. Their policies, rhetoric and fear-mongering are literally killing people. Light on facts, heavy on delusion. What a HORRIBLE tragedy! May those poor souls rest in peace! I feel for their families. To me, virulent hatred of Jews equals hatred of God since they were God’s Chosen and also from whom Christ arose. To the idiots who blamed this on Trump: I cannot resist pointing out that the vile murderer was a Trump Hater. He was sort of the opposite of the loony idiot they caught yesterday down in Florida. Crazy, vile and murderous comes from both sides. The gunman told police: TRUMP 2020 And Satan said unto thee, “Get thee forth and sow falsehoods, chaos and perdition.” Prayers for all! What we need inour country is some peace’ not more violence, not more political speaches. The left hates Israel and Jews. They want more radical muslims entering the country. Why any Jew would vote for democrat hate and corruption is a true mystery! How ignorant people on the left are. Trump has done more to help Israel than any other President, including moving our embassy to Jerusalem. Jews have a friend in Donald Trump. We don’t know who the victims are and the shooter. This is simply a Halloween political spin off from the violence in our country at this time leading up to the Mid-Term Elections So at least 8 innocent people murdered by a mad man in a US community and all of you are only able to banter about your petty political beliefs and phobias How about thanking God that your family was not murdered and maybe say a prayer for the victims and their families. Oh I get it now, your god IS your political party and your ten commandments or sermon on the mount are spouted by Fox news or CNN in daily bullet points. You no longer fear God or his judgement! They haven’t released information on the suspect. “He is a white male” good old media. what happened to the charmingly worded comment about the 6 million in Pittsburg? Was it censored? Another October Surprise. Surprise. Ensure the shooter meets his maker ASAP! Should never deserve the mercy of a trial. Terminate them (shooter / bigot). The Pittsburgh School Board is blaming Chik-Fil-A. … and I suppose this nut-job will have a 20-year-long anti-jew rap-sheet, but, the MSM will claim it’s all Trump’s fault… again. My parents, sister, and myself were married in Pittsburgh and I was born there. I also have relatives there. This is a terrible event and people of good will need to come together to stop this. In Harrisburg, Pa. under the auspices of Rabbi Carl Choper is The Interfaith Alliance of Pennsylvania, whose mission it is to defuse conflict so people can learn to end their difference and work together. I am proud to be part of that organization. Hopefully, similar groups exist around the nation and internationally. Preach to the Democrat left; that is the seat of anti-Semitism in this country. Thoughts and prayers to the families of the deceased, and injured. Special thanks to the 3 officers who were injured stopping the human garbage . Canadian LEO (ret’d) NRA still insists that we all be allowed to own military style weapons, and “guns are not the problem”. Democrats always vote against Jews/Israel. We have a lot of fake Jew politicians who hate Jews. They subscribe to the Muslim Quran scripture of lying and deceit to justify the ends. Doesn’t surprise me a liberal shot up and murdered these people. Democrats have been accusing Jews of murdering Palestinians and stealing their land and all sorts of conspiracy nonsense. I can’t believe some of these comments haven’t been deleted as they spew hate. And I do think that the police were “packing heat” They’ll blame this on Trump, the hero of Israel, the only President with the courage to move the capitol to Jerusalem, and try to paint his as anti-semitic, not to mention his Jewish son-in-law. Sadly, most democrats are stupid enough to believe it. Has CNN found a way to blame it on Trump yet? Lets start the “Blame Trump” countdown clock. Meanwhile, there are a lot of people dead and a lot of families in unimaginable pain. Why cant this just be about them? Why cant we try to figure out what breaks in a persons head to make them the monster that would do this? The shooter didn’t understand the difference between a Jew and a Zionist. Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Zionists are Jews. Zionists hide behind Jews. 9-11 was a Zionist job. USS Liberty was a Zionist job. Holocaust Hoax was a Zionist job. My thoughts and prayers to all those affected. It’s a sad day when violent lunatics feel compelled to target innocent people, and in this case an interfaith place of worship. Truly ridiculous. At the end of the day, hyper violent lunatics sometimes hide in the shadows, simply awaiting opportunity. After my military service an armed home invader hit a home I was having dinner at, having the means to defend myself saved many lives, including a young child. Had I not had access to my sidearm that day, I would not be typing this message. ….again, my thoughts to the victims of this madness. Indeed. Was the intruder armed with a gun? Prayers for all whose family members and friends were killed or injured. Prayers that the suspect will be punished for his crime. God Bless America and all our citizens! This is not a political crime, for it is a hate crime against Jews, per the suspect’s comments. No blame should be placed on anyone but the suspect! ❤ Meanwhile, the media is scrambling to find a way to blame this event on a Conservative or Trump supporter. If the shooter ever used the letters M,A(2),G then it is all Trump’s fault. Eight people are dead, more are injured. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the fallen and those who are injured. I am thankful that the shooter is in custody. To those who would make this about politics, I say to you that you may need to reexamine your priorities. Find your human compassion. Take care of those who need care first. Any other priority–your politics, your gun rights–can come later. People are shocked and mourning. What can you do to make the situation better now, in this moment, person to person? Fighting about open carry and spreading conspiracy theories doesn’t help anyone. Every church and synagogue in America should have armed guards watching the doors. Plus, doors should be locked once the service starts with guards either letting people in or denying them entrance. The guards can be openly carrying or have their guns concealed. Its a good thing there were no armed civilians inside…otherwise, someone might have got hurt! Pathetic of the governor to politicize the horror by blaming guns. I wonder where the governor falls on capital punishment, because we have a textbook case of someone deserving of it, where there is no possibility of convicting an innocent. A friend of mine is a part of a security detail at his local church. They are armed and have wireless communication between detail members. You can either be prepared, or you can be a victim – it’s your choice. I’m absolutely sure this was a Trump-loving white supremacist. He encourages violence, and his brownshirts are listening. When he called himself a “nationalist,” the far right wing nuts praised him. When he refused to condemn them after Charlottesville, they praised him. They do Nazi salutes while shouting “Hail Trump.” This is stochastic terrorism, and the majority of terrorist attacks in the US come from these people. This is an undebatable fact, and nothing is being done. In fact, Trump cut funding to counter right wing violence. https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/346552-trump-cut-funds-to-fight-anti-right-wing-violence Trump loves Israel. He moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem. His son in law is Jewish. His daughter is Jewish. His grandchildren are Jewish. Jews have no better friend than President Trump. However, the the mass killer said he hates Trump and did not vote for him. Which means you have more in common with this killer of Jews, than President Trump. Unfortunately, my first thought was that it was another Demacrat/deep state ploy to blame on Repubs before the election. It is unfortunate that this is what entered my mind first before my compassion and concern for all the innocent victims kicked in Guns make a country safe right gun nuts??? if trump wasn’t president there would be no gun violence. Right, because there was none under Obama. Are you kidding me? Is that sarcasm? People are warlike. They need to be taught to not be like this, and that hasn’t happened for many years. And the nonstop vitriol that’s been going on amongst EVERYONE for years now is going to produce this. We need to be able to protect ourselves. It’s natural law. Louis Farrakhan is laughing. So, when are the Democrats going to come to his defense? After all Barack Obama made excuses for the Iranians doing the exact same thing for 8 years and the Democrat party as a whole has told us not to vilify Muslims every day since 9/11 even while hundreds of millions of them chant death to jews daily. Obama even sent the Iranian Mullahs pallets full of cash as they chanted and preyed for death to all jews. The Governor said: ” Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.” He had to politicize it…just had to. Do we blame pencils when media bias distorts the truth and destroys lives? Vote out of office, all the treacherous “officials” who would sacrifice our freedom for personal gain. MAGA bomber deaths – 0. Trump hating bigot deaths – 8. In Israel the government would arrest and charge Trump and Republicans for incitement because he has a big filthy dumb stupid mouth to match his nasty foul reactionary personality that lends itself to neo-fascist racist undemocratic anti-republican causes. Long live the republic to hell with Trump Republicans and the corrupt Democrats that support and tolerate them. >”a heavy-set white male” Why is race mentioned and not the usual “suspect-teen-youth-person” descriptor used when non-whites commit crimes? Let’s see. This guy was a Nazi and hated Trump. Democrats also hate Trump. I guess by liberal logic, that makes all Democrats Nazis. It is a very said comment on the state of the world, when people can not worship in the house of their G-d without fear of being gunned down. There is nothing sacred left!! THE JEWISH QUESTION Here is the answer It’s the book of Revelation – written by Egyptians (you can look it up) – a false prophecy. Blood letting, poisoning the wells. It’s history now. It’s the fear of God + superstition + peer pressure. This book inverts the teachings of Christ. My Twitter page tells the full story. ChrisGrinnin Here is the answer It’s the book of Revelation – written by Egyptians (you can look it up) – a false prophecy. Blood letting, poisoning the wells. It’s history now. It’s the fear of God + superstition + peer pressure. This book inverts the teachings of Christ. My Twitter page tells the full story. ChrisGrinnin Don’t do the witches brew double trouble That’s not a human way to live Certainly not Christ like This will make Faquhan happy . Now let’s remember the pictures of him and Obama yucking it up and the picture of Bill Clinton sitting on the same stage with him at Aretha Franklin’s funeral services. WOW it seems he was inspired by Louis Farrakhan. You know Obama’s friend. And the shooter posted all of his Nazi hate propaganda at he Alt-right site “Gab”. Why is this not a surprise . . . Antisemitism is a direct derivative of Nationalism and always precedes a wave of terror against Others. Jews are always targeted as enemies of the State as easily identified as not US. Sincere religious folks do not accept the authority of the State as the highest Authority. Until I see real dead people and a real crime scene I will take this event with the same disbelief as Sandy Hook. Just like Batman and Las Vegas and other staged shootings, keep your smarts about you because the fakery is everywhere in this nation of news “makers” and news “tellers” . Same people involved and they are known for lying throughout history. You can thank Nancy Pelosi and Mad Maxine Waters for all the violence. They encourage it. Sadly to say, you sound like lunatics, completely unknowing about the real world, misinformed, manipulated, working against your own best interest. The rest of the world would really like to show you compassion, but you make it extremely hard for us, your closest allies. I guess we are feeling more sorry for your dead and bereaved than you are yourselves. Sad, sad, sad. Congratulations media — 11 more deaths thanks to your churning up the hatred and backing these kind of people be they BLM, Antifa or anti Semitics so that your left wing hating killers go after the Jews like those in Trump’s own family. But you don’t care as long as you get your pound of flesh and a lead story to trash Trump with. I can’t wait to see which political party will try to use this disgusting event to try and raise money for their agenda come November. I am reading the comments with this story, and I am ashamed at the hatred, and I would say the fear that drives that hatred. The problems with this country come from ourselves. Let’s own up to it, admit it, and deal with it.  Oh, right, Drumpf!!! Why should Jews have to have armed guards in their synagogues? Should all churches and mosques also have to do so? That’s nonsense, and it is encouraged by your hateful remarks which divide our nation into THEM and US. Shame on you, and your disgusting Nazi-like attitudes. And, of course, you take no responsibility for your own rhetoric. Did you or your colleagues take any responsibility for your rhetoric in constantly calling Trump Racists and Nazis for 2 years? You know, you claim everybody else has to accept responsibility for their rhetoric, but you don’t want to have any responsibility for your rhetoric or your actions. Liberals must be defeated not convinced Sadly, another shooting occurred in a gun free zone. When will people understand that gun free zones don’t work? What good is a Swat team today, they have no authority. The shooter should have been taken out feet first now the liberals will find him a supposedly good lawyer to get him off on a technicality.Until we put the fear in these animal that their lives will end for committing such heinous crimes it will continue.When the penalties for killing a Moose is greater than killing a human being something is wrong with out legal system. warn your children: “stay away from gun-free zones. they are too dangerous.” “With gentiles, it will be like any person: They need to die, but God will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money. This is his servant. That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew,” said the rabbi, who recently turned 90. Positive action would be loosening gun laws so people have the ability to IMMEDIATELY defend themselves in such a situation. I think average police response time is about 10 minutes which is way too long to endure a continual barrage of bullets. PD responded in this situation amazingly fast. Prayers for all….. Males are territorial animals. They establish *societies based a race/ language/ religion.It is how the human animal is. No male group in human history has been subjected to the kind of compulsory integration – race/ gender /’group’ nullification – like white Christian males. Using our legislative system to do this is WRONG. We now have human waves of racial groups/ religious groups, you name the “groups’ …descending on America to strip white males of everything they have/ built/ occupy. We have a political party – the DEMS – dedicated to doing exactly this.. Civil rights laws (invented by white males in the 60s) are the culprit. But no way to rid the system of these diabolical laws. So bad tings will continue to happen. Written laws were NEVER intended to be used to defeat/ deny/ defeat what is part of human nature. Jews have been kicked out of over 130 countries, over 200 times, Youtube it.. Why must they continue with their evil ways? Jews, please stop your deviant actions in the media. Here’s the question I want to know . . . who are his people? That should give you motive and opportunity? So when do CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC the NYT and Washington Post begin blaming this on Mad Maxine, Nancy Pelosi, Obama, Hillary, Holder, Schumer and their own “Fake News” people for inciting violence in the streets and even in people’s homes with their divisive rhetoric?! Gave himself up. Evidently he chose 3 squares, conjugal visits and healthcare for the next 40 years. “Thanks, PA!” fake story…Nothing but a lie… Can’t blame Trump or the NRA. The blame for these killings falls on the courts, the schools, the home and greed. Unless we put correctness and discipline back in society, we will continue to see this more and more until one day, a victim will be you or a loved one. But then, no one will care. It is time to change that and fast. George Vreeland Hill I am a Jewish woman and I am so sorry that your Synagogue had to deal with a senseless shooting like this. I pray to GOD that healing will begin for each and every one of you. May the dead RIP!!! I love my background and will never disown where I come from. Love to each and everyone of you that reads this. Ann Lynn KDKA needs to shut down the comments section. Many bots writing some really disgusting comments. Families are trying to come together tonight. I lived in Pittsburgh for four years. It’s a nice town that doesn’t deserve violence of any kind. There are very wicked men and women who walk this Earth, and some of them are NUTS. If you are a decent person, this world needs you, and it needs you ARMED. After THIS incident, we wont be turning in our weapons to ANYBODY. Rather we will be buying MORE GUNS, and MORE AMMO. “Anti-racists” say there’s a RACE problem. They say it’ll be solved when non-Whites pour into ALL & ONLY White nations and “assimilate” to get a brown mixture. They say only White nations have this RACE problem; they say non-White nations are fine. If I object to my own genocide these “anti-racists” say I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews. They say they’re anti-racist. What they are is anti-White. Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White. Donald trump the head of all this issues, He makes people hate any body or any country or any relgious shame of this country with all guns issue , They can not stop it all about money money money Guy’s a dead ringer for Joe Manchin. The guy hated Trump and voted for Hillary..IMO, that makes him a Democrat Hillary supporters are dangerous. Tom Wolf’s message regarding weapons that shouldn’t be in the hands of the public….sorry, it’s not the weapons, it’s the sick minds that commit these acts. America is full of people with little regard for life. There has to be a change in the spiritual nature of America, a renewed respect for life, the law, for one another. The blood of 11 Jewish people is on President Trump’s hands, as he declared himself a “Nationalist” (another name for a Nazi) within days of this horrendous massacre. And for him to suggest that armed guards inside the synagogue would have lessened the number of fatalities shows just how clueless Trump is regarding the nature of Jewish people to use words and not guns to defuse potentially volatile situations. Trump needs to be removed from office. Period. One thing always left out of the conversation is who to pray to. Yeshua Hamashiàch said ‘no man comes to the father, but by me’ . Also, ‘ if you have seen me, you have seen the father’. So get the address right. Jesus of Nazareth. Heaven.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/church-shooting-texas.html---split---Advertisement Supported by By David Montgomery, Christopher Mele and Manny Fernandez Read the latest on the Texas shooting with Monday’s updates. SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — A gunman clad in all black, with a ballistic vest strapped to his chest and a military-style rifle in his hands, opened fire on parishioners at a Sunday service at a small Baptist church in rural Texas, killing at least 26 people and turning this tiny town east of San Antonio into the scene of the country’s newest mass horror. The gunman was identified by the Texas Department of Public Safety as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. Mr. Kelley, who lived in New Braunfels, Tex., died shortly after the attack. He had served in the Air Force at a base in New Mexico but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations. The motive for the attack was unclear on Sunday, but the grisly nature of it could not have been clearer: Families gathered in pews, clutching Bibles and praying to the Lord, were murdered in cold blood on the spot. Mr. Kelley started firing at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs not long after the Sunday morning service began at 11 a.m., officials said. He was armed with a Ruger military-style rifle, and within minutes, many of those inside the small church were either dead or wounded. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, and among the dead were several children, a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. At least 20 more were wounded. “It’s something we all say does not happen in small communities, although we found out today it does,” said Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs. Sheriff Tackitt and other officials said the gunman first stopped at a gas station across Highway 87 from the church. He drove across the street, got out of his car and began firing from the outside, moving to the right side of the church, the authorities said. Then he entered the building and kept firing. The authorities received their first call about a gunman at about 11:20 a.m. Officials and witnesses said Mr. Kelley appeared to be prepared for an assault, with black tactical gear, multiple rounds of ammunition and a ballistic vest. “He went there, he walked in, started shooting people and then took off,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas congressman who represents the region and who was briefed by law enforcement officials. A shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., killed at least 26 people on Sunday. When Mr. Kelley emerged from the church, an armed neighbor exchanged gunfire with him, hitting Mr. Kelley, who fled in his vehicle. Neighbors apparently followed him, chasing him into the next county, Guadalupe County, where Mr. Kelley crashed his car. Mr. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle. Officials said it was unclear how Mr. Kelley had died. At the church, he left behind a scene of carnage. Of the 26 fatalities, 23 people were found dead inside the church, two were found outside, and one died later at a hospital. Speaking at a news conference in Japan, the first stop on his tour of Asia, President Trump called the shooting a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation,” adding the gunman was a “very deranged individual.” He also ordered flags flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal buildings through Thursday. In Floresville, Tex., hours after the attack, Scott Holcombe, 30, sat with his sister on the curb outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center. They were both in tears. Their father, Bryan Holcombe, had been guest preaching at the church, they said, and he and their mother, Karla Holcombe, were killed. “I’m dumbfounded,” Mr. Holcombe said, also noting that his pregnant sister-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, had been killed. “This is unimaginable. My father was a good man, and he loved to preach. He had a good heart.” His sister, Sarah Slavin, 33, added: “They weren’t afraid of death. They had a strong faith, so there’s comfort in that. I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn’t scared.” A parishioner, Sandy Ward, said that a daughter-in-law and three of her grandchildren were shot. Her grandson, who is 5, was shot four times and remained in surgery Sunday night. She said she was awaiting word on her other family members. Ms. Ward said she did not attend services on Sunday because of her troubled knees and a bad hip. “I just started praying for everybody who was there” when she learned of the shooting, she said. At a news conference on Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott said that he and other Texans were asking “for God’s comfort, for God’s guidance and for God’s healing for all those who are suffering.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping in the investigation, which was being led by the Texas Rangers. The shooting unfolded on the eighth anniversary of the attack in 2009 on Fort Hood in Texas, when an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, killed 13 people in one of the deadliest mass shootings at an American military base. Major Hasan carried out his attack in an attempt to wage jihad on American military personnel. The death toll on Sunday also exceeded the number killed in 1966 by a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Charles Whitman, who opened fire from the school’s clock tower in a day of violence that ultimately killed 17. It also exceeded the number killed during a rampage at a restaurant in Killeen in 1991 in which a gunman fatally shot 23 people and then took his own life. And the shooting on Sunday occurred more than two years after Dylann S. Roof opened fire at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015, killing nine people, including the pastor. The motive in that attack was racial hatred — Mr. Roof, a white supremacist, plotted an assault on a black congregation — but no motive has been established by the authorities in the shooting in Sutherland Springs. The First Baptist Church is predominantly white, and Mr. Kelley is white. The authorities said Mr. Kelley used an Ruger AR-15 variant — a knockoff of the standard service rifle carried by the American military for roughly half a century. Almost all AR-15 variants legally sold in the United States fire only semiautomatically, and they were covered by the federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994. Since the ban expired in 2004, the weapons have been legal to sell or possess in much of the United States, and sales of AR-15s have surged. Ruger’s AR-15s made for civilian markets sell for about $500 to $900, depending on the model. Mr. Kelley grew up in New Braunfels, in his parents’ nearly $1 million home, and was married in 2014. He had been married at least once before and was sued for divorce in 2012 in New Mexico, the same year he was court-martialed on charges of assaulting his wife and child. Why he chose to attack a church 30 miles away from his home is one of the questions that remained unanswered. Sutherland Springs in Wilson County is about 34 miles east of downtown San Antonio, in a slow-paced region where church-going is a common part of the Sunday routine. The church marquee on Sunday needed updating from last week, reading, “Join Us, Fall Fest, Oct 31, 6 to 8 PM.” The unincorporated community has a population that numbers in the low hundreds — the 2000 census was 362, according to the Texas State Historical Association. The preliminary death toll would amount to about 7 percent of that population. Joseph Silva, 49, who lives about five miles northeast of Sutherland Springs, described Sutherland Springs as “a one-blinking-light town.” “Everybody is pretty grief-stricken,” Mr. Silva said. “Everyone’s worried.” On Sunday night, a few minutes down a pitch-black road, victims’ families gathered at another house of worship, the River Oaks Church. Its parking lot was full of about 50 large trucks, and parents walked into the building holding their children’s hands. The police kept tight control over the scene, refusing to allow any reporters to enter. One man in a cowboy hat was also turned away. “They said they’re gathering to inform the families, but they’ll only let immediate family in, only if you have a wristband,” he said. A short while later, a young man rushed out to his truck, visibly upset, and raced away. The First Baptist Church, the scene of the shooting, was also sealed off, with yellow police-line tape posted around the church grounds. First Baptist is a little church, albeit a tech-savvy one. The service at the church last Sunday was posted on YouTube, one of several posted there. Videos posted online show lyrics to the hymns appearing on television screens with parishioners playing electric guitars and a sign language interpreter translating the songs. The video of last Sunday’s service begins with a rendition of a song called “Happiness Is the Lord.” Then the pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told his parishioners — 20 to 30 were visible in the video — to walk around the room and “shake somebody’s hand.” “Tell them it’s good to see them in God’s house this morning,” Pastor Pomeroy said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Wilson County commissioner. He is Albert Gamez Jr., not Gamaz.

After a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 people dead, a vigil was held in Westwood honoring the victims just hours within an interfaith march in Woodland Hills celebrating religious freedom Sunday. Chris Wolfe reports for the KTLA 5 News at 6 on Oct. 28, 2018. A Lion Air flight with 188 people on board crashed into the sea just minutes after taking off from Indonesia’s capital on Monday. Indonesia’s disaster agency posted photos online of a crushed smartphone, books, bags and parts of the aircraft fuselage that had been collected by search and rescue vessels that have converged on the area. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the aircraft, on a 1 hour and 10 minute flight to Pangkal Pinang on an island chain off Sumatra, was carrying 181 passengers, including one child and two babies, and seven crew members.

The two longtime friends were stunned. “When is something going to change?” Lieb wondered.

Another year, another World Series celebration at Dodgers Stadium by a team that wasn’t the Dodgers. It was almost too much to take for Los Angeles fans who watched the Boston Red Sox take the series in five games Sunday by winning 5-1, the same score of the Houston Astros’ series-clinching win a year earlier. “It sucks a lot,” said fan Brian Beck, who sat in the stands through both the Astros’ celebrations. “It’s one of the worst experiences as a fan ever.” The locals have now gone three decades without a World Series title, a span where other LA teams including the NBA’s Lakers and the NH...

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/klay-thompsons-cold-shooting-doesnt-worry-warriors-there-more-it---split---Klay Thompson is at his offensive best when his head is clear and his feet are set. That’s it. Nothing else. No need for deep psychoanalysis. When the Warriors star keeps it simple, his shots go in, opponents lose hope and the Warriors triumph. This, however, is a time when things might not be as simple as usual for Thompson. He’s in a place he has never been -- an established All-Star, with a history of success, in the final season of his contract. [RELATED: Positives, negatives from Warriors' win over Knicks] And, also, on a team with the highest possible expectations. So it might take a week or three before Thompson settles in and plays basketball. Consider that Thompson entered the season as a career 42.2 percent shooter from 3-point distance. He’s also coming off his most accurate season both inside the arc (52.7) and beyond it (44 percent). Six games into the season, Thompson’s 3-point shooting has been as bad as at any point in his seven-year NBA career. He’s 4 of 31 -- 12.9 percent. It’s early but atypical. Klay’s 3-ball numbers look like something from a Zaza Pachulia post-practice trick-shot session. “We’ve seen this before,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said in New York, ahead of Sunday's game against the Nets. “Two years ago, Klay had an almost carbon-copy start to his season. Sometimes the very beginning of the year is like that. You get off to a rough start and it snowballs, and then you just kind of stop and go, ‘Oh, yeah, right, there’s about 75 games left.’ “Inevitably, the dam will break, and he’ll start going nuts again.” That’s what the smart money says. Six games is a small sample size. A great shooter doesn’t lose it at age 28. Two years ago, Thompson was 11 of 53 (20.7 percent) from deep in the first seven games. He was 27 of 56 (48.2 percent) over the next seven. The circumstances are different this time. Though Klay’s reputation is of someone who isn’t a worrier and, therefore, is affected by the business of the game, the fact is he hasn’t had much to worry about as he does now. Thompson repeatedly has said his goal is to remain with the Warriors. The team has expressed mutual sentiments. It’s the money that remains in question, and Thompson wants a contract commensurate to his status as an All-Star and one of the top two-way guards in the league. Can we really assume he doesn’t want to chase the super-max money that comes with being named All-NBA, thereby putting pressure on the Warriors to pay up? Thompson is doing a solid job on defense, but many of his shots have been rushed, as he fears he won’t get another chance to shoot until next week. Even some of his open looks have been launched with haste. The Warriors, for the most part, don’t mind because they know how tremendous Thompson is once his shots start lining up. “We’re just telling Klay to keep shooting, keep being aggressive,” Kevon Looney said in New York. “Klay is going to keep being himself. Eventually his shots are going to go in. We’re not really worried about Klay. We just want to keep him involved, keep giving him his touches.” [RELATED: KD's big fourth quarter saves Warriors in New York] The only complaint Warriors players and coaches have with Thompson are the occasional contested shots when others are open. Kerr has shown no desire to curtail Thompson’s shooting. Indeed, the Warriors want Thompson firing every time he gets a good shot. “It’s going to happen,” Kerr says. “We all know. It’s a matter of finding our groove as a team. That usually helps Klay.” It's going to happen. And when it does, you’ll see the difference. Thompson’s feet will be set, and those little signs of frustration will have peeled away. It will look simple because it will be simple. Meanwhile, something to think about: Thompson’s cold start is obscured by the excellence of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. As long as they are teammates, Thompson knows he can find himself on his own time. He can’t know that if he were to go elsewhere next July. But it’s too early for Thompson to think about that. Right? Right? While cameras and eyeballs follow the wondrous exploits of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, as well as the struggles of Klay Thompson, the Warriors could be onto something on the opposite end of their roster. The defending NBA champions might have an effective bench and, moreover, perhaps their most versatile yet under coach Steve Kerr. The young big men -- Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney -- are doing well in replacing David West and Zaza Pachulia. Jonas Jerebko, the veteran big man brought in over the summer, has been productive. Alfonzo McKinnie, the newly discovered combo forward, has been a valuable addition. They all played a role in a 120-114 win over the Nets on Sunday at Barclays Center. Curry scored 35 points and Durant had 34, but nothing was more encouraging than the reserves' contributions. “Our bench is starting to round into form,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters in Brooklyn. “I love what Jonas did tonight. I thought ‘Zo was really good as well. We can always trust Looney. We’re playing a lot of people, and I’m really proud of everybody for being ready to play.” This was the second consecutive game in which the Warriors' bench made a positive impact, and the second in a row in which every reserve posted a plus rating. Insofar as this is one of the areas in question at the dawn of the season, it comes as a welcome sign. It’s McKinnie, though, that has been the pleasant discovery. While Jerebko is a veteran and Looney and Bell were on the championship team last season, McKinnie came to camp without any guarantees, simply hoping to make the roster but prepared to play in the G League. “A lot of teams are going to put him in the scouting report now,” Durant said. “I’m surprised,” Kerr said. “We knew he was athletic from the first day of training camp. But he’s come a long way offensively pretty quickly.” McKinnie scored nine points (4-of-5 shooting) in 17 minutes on Sunday, adding five rebounds, one steal and an impressive chase-down block of Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie at the rim. Over his last four games, totaling 51 minutes, McKinnie has 26 points (11-of-16 shooting, including 3 of 6 from deep) and 18 rebounds. “He’s getting more confident shooting the 3,” Durant observed. “We want him to be aggressive; we don’t care who shoots the ball, as long as it’s a good shot. And he’s knocking that thing down. Hopefully, it continues. We’ve got to support him and encourage him every minute he’s on the floor, because he’s one of those guys that can be in the league for a while.” McKinnie’s journey is nothing less than inspirational. He attended two colleges (Eastern Illinois for two years, Wisconsin-Green Bay for two more), and has done multiple stints in the G League, as well as played in Mexico and Luxembourg. Now, at age 26, he appears to have found his way into the NBA for good. If McKinnie has been the unexpected treasure, Jerebko is shaping up as the answer to several needs, most notably as big man with a natural 3-point shooting touch. After totaling eight points and seven rebounds Friday against the Knicks -- and posting a team-best plus-34 in 19 minutes -- Jerebko came up with four points, six rebounds and two assists in 15 minutes Sunday. “Jerebko was great tonight,” Kerr said. “He’s really had a good start to the season. He’s tough, rebounds well and sets good screens. His ability to step out and make a 3-point shot is important as well.” Jerebko, at 6-foot-10, can spell Draymond Green at power forward or fill in at center if needed. His effort already has paid dividends; Jerebko’s game-winning tip-in Oct. 19 at Utah was one of the most memorable plays of the early season. With Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Bell, Jerebko, Looney and McKinnie, the Warriors can go 11 deep with confidence. That wasn't always the case last season, or the year before. Between the decision to stagger usage of Curry and Durant after the first quarter and having Jerebko and McKinnie capable of dropping triples, the Warriors’ search for scoring and activity off the bench might be over. “We can play better, but I like the direction we’re heading,” Kerr said. “We feel like we’re getting better as we go, and our bench is starting to solidify. We’re starting to see combinations and patterns that work. I like where our team is right now.” BOX SCORE The Warriors took command in the second quarter Sunday and held on for a 120-114 win over the Nets at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. This one didn’t go into the win column until Kevin Durant made two free throws with 13.9 seconds remaining. Stephen Curry added two more free throws with 2.0 seconds left. Here are three takeaways culled from a game the Nets made very close with a late charge: Curry and Durant combined to score 81 points in a home win over the Wizards last Wednesday. They combined for 70 in beating the Knicks in New York on Friday. They’re cooling off, it seems. The two league MVP candidates produced 69 points between them against the Nets, and the Warriors needed every one of them. Curry scored 35 points (11 of 26 shooting from the field, 7 of 15 from beyond the arc, 6 of 7 from the line), adding seven rebounds and three assists. He played 36 minutes and finished plus-11. Durant finished with 34 points (11 of 20 shooting from the field, 2 of 6 from deep, 10 of 11 from the line), eight rebounds, six assists, one block and one steal in 39 minutes. As long as Curry and Durant are torching defenses, Klay Thompson (18 points and 1-of-5 3-point shooting) can take his time joining the party. Draymond Green missed more than two weeks of training camp and preseason action. He’s behind, but there were signs in the last home two games that he was starting to catch up and be the player Warriors fans have come to expect. If the first two games of this road trip are any indication, he’s officially back. Green totaled eight points, 13 assists, four rebounds and five steals against Brooklyn. That came two days after Friday's 128-100 win over the Knicks, in which he delivered 18 points (7-of-8 shooting from the field, 2 of 3 from deep), four rebounds and three steals. Though he led the Warriors in assists in both games (six against the Knicks, 13 against the Nets), it’s the shooting that makes such a dramatic impact. When Green is making 3-pointers even occasionally, it’s a huge benefit to the Warriors' offense because it opens up space for his teammates. The Warriors have been on a constant search for reliable bench support beyond the likes of Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. They might be onto something. Alfonzo McKinnie and Jonas Jerebko again were effective and continue to force coach Steve Kerr to keep them in the rotation. McKinnie, whose journey with the Warriors began with an invitation to training camp last month, contributed nine points (4-of-5 shooting from the field, 1 of 2 from deep), five rebounds, one block and one steal. He played 17 minutes and finished plus-12. Jerebko, who signed with the Warriors after becoming a free agent in July, scored just four points but also came up with six rebounds and two assists. He played 15 minutes and finished plus-7. Both players also performed well Friday in New York, with Jerebko totaling eight points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes while McKinnie put in seven points in nine minutes.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/us/shooting-reported-at-temple-in-wisconsin.html---split---Advertisement By STEVEN YACCINO, MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ and MARC SANTORAAUG. 5, 2012 OAK CREEK, Wis. — The priests had gathered in the lobby of the sprawling Sikh temple here in suburban Milwaukee, and lunch was being prepared as congregants were arriving for Sunday services. Instead of worshipers, though, an armed man stepped through the door and started firing. In an attack that the police said they were treating as “a domestic terrorist-type incident,” the gunman stalked through the temple around 10:30 a.m. Congregants ran for shelter and barricaded themselves in bathrooms and prayer halls, where they made desperate phone calls and sent anguished texts pleading for help as confusion and fear took hold. Witnesses described a scene of chaos and carnage. Jatinder Mangat, 40, who was on his way to the temple when he heard reports about the shooting, said he had tried to call his uncle, the temple’s president, but reached the head priest, Gurmail Singh, instead. “He was crying. Everyone was screaming,” Mr. Mangat said. “He said that my uncle was shot and was lying on the floor and asked why you guys are not sending an ambulance and police.” Mr. Singh, he said, had locked himself in a bathroom with four other people, including two children. Six people were killed and three others were wounded on Sunday at the 17,000-square-foot Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, a city of about 35,000 just south of Milwaukee, officials said. Advertisement The gunman’s rampage ended when one of the first police officers to arrive shot and killed him. Another police officer, who tried to aid a victim, was ambushed by the gunman and shot multiple times. He was in critical condition but was expected to survive, the authorities said. Advertisement The police did not release any details about the gunman or a possible motive for the shooting, beyond raising the prospect of terrorism. Thomas Ahern, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the killer was a 40-year-old white man. John Edwards, the police chief in Oak Creek, said at a news conference that weapons had been found at the scene. He said the F.B.I. would lead the investigation. “This remains an active investigation in its early stages,” Teresa Carlson, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Milwaukee division, said in a statement. “While the F.B.I. is investigating whether this matter might be an act of domestic terrorism, no motive has been determined at this time.” The shootings reverberated from this small community to Washington and beyond, including India, where the religion was founded and many of the congregants have family ties. President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, released statements on Sunday expressing sorrow. “Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin,” the president said. “At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded.” Mr. Romney called the shootings “a senseless act of violence and a tragedy” that he said should never befall any house of worship. Advertisement “Our hearts are with the victims, their families and the entire Oak Creek Sikh community,” Mr. Romney said. “We join Americans everywhere in mourning those who lost their lives and in prayer for healing in the difficult days ahead.” Many members of the close-knit Sikh community here said the attack had shattered their sense of security. “Everyone here is thinking this is a hate crime for sure,” said Manjit Singh, who goes to a different temple in the region. “People think we are Muslims.” Though violence against Sikhs in Wisconsin was unheard of before the shooting, many in this community said they had sensed a rise in antipathy since the attacks on Sept. 11 and suspected it was because people mistake them for Muslims. Followers of Sikhism, or Gurmat, a monotheistic faith founded in the 15th century in South Asia, typically do not cut their hair, and men often wear colorful turbans and refrain from cutting their beards. “Most people are so ignorant they don’t know the difference between religions,” said Ravi Chawla, 65, a businesswoman who moved to the region from Pakistan in the 1970s. “Just because they see the turban they think you’re Taliban.” There are around 314,000 Sikhs in the United States, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. The temple in Oak Creek, one of two large congregations in the Milwaukee area, was founded in 1997 and has about 400 worshipers.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Threats against Sikh-Americans have become acute enough that in April, Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Indians and Indian-Americans, sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urging the F.B.I. to collect data on hate crimes committed against them. In the previous year alone, he said in the letter, two Sikh men in a Sacramento suburb were slain, a Sikh temple in Michigan was vandalized, and a Sikh man was beaten in New York. “The more information our law enforcement agencies have on violence against Sikh-Americans, the more they can do to help prevent these crimes and bring those who commit them to justice,” Mr. Crowley said in a statement at the time. By Sunday evening, the F.B.I. had cordoned off a street in Cudahy, a town about five miles from the temple, where it was executing a search warrant related to the shooting, Ms. Carlson said at a news conference. “It’s going to be a long night,” she said, declining to give further details. A law enforcement official said some residents on the street had been ordered to leave their homes. Advertisement At a news conference, Chief Edwards described a dramatic scene when officers arrived at the temple soon after the first 911 call. After the gunman ambushed the first officer, Chief Edwards said, another police officer exchanged fire with the gunman, bringing him down. Bradley Wentlandt, the chief of police in nearby Greenfield, said the wounded officer was a 20-year veteran whose actions probably saved many lives. Four bodies were found inside the temple and three outside, including that of the gunman, Chief Wentlandt said. Three men with gunshot wounds were admitted to Froedtert Hospital, the Milwaukee region’s main trauma center, said Nalissa Wienke, a spokeswoman for the hospital. One victim had been shot in the head and extremities and another in the abdomen. The third was described as having neck wounds. There were initially conflicting reports about whether there was more than one gunman and whether hostages had been taken inside the temple. Local news agencies, citing text messages from people inside, reported that two or more gunmen could have been involved. “The best information is that there was only one gunman,” Chief Edwards said at a news conference. The shooting came about two weeks after a gunman killed 12 people and wounded nearly 60 in an attack at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. In response to the shooting on Sunday, the police in New York said security was being increased at Sikh temples in the city. “There is no known threat against Sikh temples in New York City; however, the coverage is being put in place out of an abundance of caution,” the New York police said in a statement. Advertisement Outside the temple here, friends and relatives were struggling to understand what had happened. Many in the community had contacted friends and family who were in the temple when the violence broke out. Harpreet Singh, a nephew of the temple president, said his aunt, the president’s wife, was in the kitchen with other women preparing food for services when they heard gunshots. “She said they heard a bang, bang, bang,” Mr. Singh, 36, said in a telephone interview from the basement of a bowling alley near from the temple, where the police and F.B.I. agents were interviewing survivors. Mr. Singh, recounting the shooting as told to him by his aunt Satpal Kaleka, said the women had hidden in a nearby pantry. The women escaped, witnessing the gunman’s carnage along the way, he said. Mr. Singh was on his way to services with his wife, his two children and his parents when the police stopped them outside the parking lot. “There were police cars running into the complex,” he said. “A couple of weeks ago, some kid had set off a fire alarm, so we thought something like that had happened.” People begin gathering at the temple as early as 6:30 a.m. on Sundays, but most arrive around 10:30 or 11 for services, Mr. Singh said. He believed about 30 to 35 people were inside when the shooting began, but had the gunman arrived just 15 minutes later, Mr. Singh said, 100 to 150 people would have been inside. An article on Monday about the fatal shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee misidentified the location where two Sikh men were killed last year in California. The killings took place in the Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove, not in Sacramento. An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a congregant who was on his way to the temple when the shooting began. He is Jatinder Mangat, not Jatindev. Steven Yaccino reported from Oak Creek, and Michael Schwirtz and Marc Santora from New York. Ray Rivera and Jack Begg contributed reporting from New York. A version of this article appears in print on August 6, 2012, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Gunman Kills 6 at a Sikh Temple Near Milwaukee.

NEW YORK -- New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill on Sunday apologized to a woman who came forward with a rape allegation in 1994 but was discredited by police, saying the department let her down "in almost every possible way." In a letter, O'Neill offered the woman his "heartfelt apology for all aspersions cast upon your credibility by NYPD personnel those many years ago." The woman, who is African-American, had told police in April 1994 that she had been in Prospect Park in Brooklyn when she was dragged into the bushes and raped.

SAO PAULO -- In some of his first words to the nation as president-elect, far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro promised to defend the constitution and unite a bitterly divided populace. His left-wing rival immediately vowed to mount a vigorous opposition, while rights groups warned against a rollback of civil liberties. That juxtaposition underscored the reality that the end of the election was not the end of acrimony and that myriad challenges lay ahead for Latin America's largest nation.

PITTSBURGH — An entire stadium went silent before Sunday's Steelers-Browns game to remember Saturday's victims.

Nowhere is that more true than in Squirrel Hill, the neighborhood around the synagogue where 11 people were slain. Squirrel Hill is picturesque and Pittsburgh's most ethnically diverse enclaves — home to a quarter of the city's Jewish community.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/latest-suspect-told-police-wanted-jews-die-105951716.html---split---PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 7:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says federal prosecutors are seeking approval to pursue the death penalty against Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. Brady says he has begun the process to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions' approval as required by law to pursue a capital case against Bowers. Brady says multiple search warrants have been issued in the investigation of Bowers, a long-haul trucker who worked as an independent contractor. Police responding to the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue wounded Bowers and arrested him. Bowers is scheduled to appear in court early Monday afternoon for a hearing. ___ 7:15 p.m. Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help others, and "they always did it with a smile." That's how longtime friend Jo Stepaniak remembers her neighbors of decades in a townhouse community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. Eighty-six-year-old Sylvan Simon was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor, the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan Simon broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. Bernice Simon was a former nurse. Neighbors say the 84-year-old loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun says both Simons were "an active, steady," and devoted presence at Tree of Life synagogue. The couple was among those massacred Saturday at the temple, where the Simons married in a candlelight ceremony in 1956. ___ 6:50 p.m. At least 2,000 mourners packed Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh and thousands more stood outside at a vigil for the 11 who were killed during Sabbath services at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said he began services at 9:45, and the shooting started a few minutes later. He said there were 12 in the sanctuary at the time, most sitting in the back. Myers said: "I helped pull out the people that I could from the front. But, alas, I had eight people in the back. One fortunately survived." Myers said: "I'm a survivor. I'm a mourner." He added: "Seven of my congregants were shot dead in my sanctuary. My holy place has been defiled." ___ 6:20 p.m. The rabbi of the New Light Congregation who is credited with shepherding some of the congregants behind a door and saving their lives during Saturday's shooting spoke at a vigil in Pittsburgh Sunday night. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman's voice cracked with emotion as he spoke of losing three pillars of the community who, he said, "would give you the shirt off their back." He said they volunteered not only at the synagogue but in the community at large. Said Perlman: "What happened yesterday will not break us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together." He added: "We will not be ruined by this event." ___ 5:55 p.m. Hundreds of people have gathered in the nation's capital to remember the 11 congregants killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. A vigil was held Sunday evening in Washington's Dupont Circle to pay tribute to those killed a day earlier at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Mourners sang and prayed together. Others held lit candles and held signs, including one that read "Tree of Life victims deserve better." Some in the crowd wept as the names of the 11 victims were read aloud. Police say the suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, told police he wanted to "kill Jews." Eight men and three women were killed when Bowers opened fire. The FBI said he was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns. Bowers faces federal and state charges. He's due in court Monday. ___ 4:25 p.m. Two brothers killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were an inseparable, warm-hearted pair who never missed Saturday services. That's according to ACHIEVA, an organization that provides services to people with disabilities and had worked with Cecil and David Rosenthal for years. ACHIEVA Vice President Chris Schopf recalls 59-year-old Cecil's infectious laugh and 54-year-old David's gentle spirit. Schopf says the two "looked out for one another" and were "kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Their sister is chief of staff to state Rep. Dan Frankel, who recalls seeing the brothers at Tree of Life whenever he went there. He calls them "very sweet, gentle, caring men." __ 4:05 p.m. Richard Gottfried was a devoted member of the New Light Congregation, going to the synagogue every Saturday morning without fail. He was killed Saturday as a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Stephen Cohen, the co-president of New Light, says Gottfried and another member who was also killed Saturday were the "religious heart of our congregation." "They led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. The 65-year-old Gottfried was also preparing for a new chapter in his life. The dentist, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not afford dental care normally, was preparing to retire in the next few months. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife, Peg Durachko. __ 3:30 p.m. Israel's president is sending a message of solidarity after the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Israel stands with the Jewish victims and the Pittsburgh community. In a videotaped message set to open an interfaith vigil Sunday, President Reuven Rivlin will tell participants: "You are not alone! The people of Israel and the entire Jewish people stand with you!" That's according to a transcript of the message provided by his office. "We must say loud and clear — this was an act of anti-semitism," Rivlin says, according to the transcript. "We cannot, we must not, we will not ignore it or tolerate it." Rivlin, who acts in a mostly ceremonial capacity, will conclude his message of consolation by reciting the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. __ 2:50 p.m. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is joining the city's religious leaders and other elected officials to condemn the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and vowing to protect the city's Jewish communities from violence. The Democrat spoke outside a Manhattan synagogue Sunday afternoon with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, including Roman Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan and the Rev. Al Sharpton. De Blasio says the people of New York stand with the 11 victims of Saturday's shooting and their families. He says, "Violence against people because of their faith does not represent our values." De Blasio says city police will be out in force to protect synagogues and Jewish centers. __ 2 p.m. Daniel Stein, who was among the 11 people shot dead inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday, was a very visible member of the city's Jewish community as a leader in the New Light Congregation. The co-president of the area's Hadassah chapter, Nancy Shuman, says Judaism was very important to the 71-year-old Stein. His wife, Sharyn, is the chapter's membership vice president. Shuman says, "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." Halle says Stein "was somebody that everybody liked." __ 1:45 p.m. Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg was among the 11 victims of a gunman who opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday. The 74-year-old spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center. She retired in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects, including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, says she is devastated by the murder of her colleague and friend. Leinhardt says, "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being." 1:30 p.m. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns have observed a moment of silence at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field for the 11 people killed by a gunman inside a synagogue in the city Saturday. There were other such tributes at NFL games elsewhere Sunday. Eight men and three women were murdered inside the Tree of Life Synagogue. The names of the victims, which included a pair of brothers and a married couple, were released Sunday. In a statement issued before Sunday's game, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the slayings the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." __ 1 p.m. A law enforcement official says the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue had a license to carry firearms and legally owned his guns. The official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke Sunday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Police say Robert Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Court papers say Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Federal prosecutors have charged Bowers with 29 criminal offenses and state authorities have also leveled charges. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. — Michael Balsamo in Washington __ 11:40 a.m. Condolences and remembrances of the 11 victims of the deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday are beginning to roll out on social media and in emails. They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors. Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus sent an email to his former coworkers Sunday asking them to pass along his condolences to the family of Jerry Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician. Claus says Rabinowitz was more than a physician for him and his family for the past three decades, saying, "he was truly a trusted confidant and healer." He says Rabinowitz had an uplifting demeanor and would provide sage advice. ___ 11:20 a.m. A neighbor of the man charged in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre says the suspect kept to himself. Chris Hall said Sunday that he never heard or saw anything to indicate that 46-year-old Robert Bowers harbored anti-Semitic views or posed a threat. Authorities say Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team shot and wounded him. Bowers faces state and federal charges. Hall says nothing stood out about Bowers. He says "the most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed." Six others were wounded in the attack, including four officers, one of whom remains in critical condition. Two worshippers also remain hospitalized, one of them in critical condition. ___ 10 a.m. The 11 people killed in the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh included a married couple, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, and two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal. The Allegheny County medical examiners' office released the victims' names Sunday. David Rosenthal was the youngest at 54. The eldest was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. The dead also included Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Jerry Rabinowitz, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax and Irving Younger. Fellow members of the New Light Congregation say Wax was a pillar of the congregation, filling many roles there. Friend Myron Snider says Wax was a retired accountant who was unfailingly generous. Wax was in his late 80s. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Bowers is being treated for gunshot wounds and is due in court Monday. ___ 9:30 a.m. Authorities have released the names of the 11 people killed by a gunman during worship services in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials said at a news conference Sunday that the victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Officials previously said three women and eight men were killed. Bowers has been arrested and is being treated for gunshot wounds at a hospital. The U.S. attorney's office has charged Bowers with 29 federal counts. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. State authorities have also leveled charges. ___ 8 a.m. German leaders are mourning the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and stressing the need to push back against anti-Semitism. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." President Frank-Walter Steinmeier voiced his dismay at the attack, which left 11 dead, in a condolence message to U.S. President Donald Trump. Steinmeier wrote that "this abhorrent crime reminds us all to do what is in our power to advocate against hatred and violence, against anti-Semitism and exclusion, and to counter with determination those who incite them." ___ 7:30 a.m. Pope Francis is grieving with Pittsburgh's Jewish community following the massacre at a synagogue, denouncing the "inhuman act of violence" and praying for an end to the "flames of hatred" that fueled it. Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter's Square, a day after a gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews opened fire in the synagogue during Sabbath services, killing 11 people. Francis prayed for the dead, injured and their families and said: "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence." He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." Francis has frequently spoken out against religiously inspired violence and has denounced the easy availability of guns thanks to weapons manufacturers, whom he has called "merchants of death." ___ 7 a.m. Police say the suspect in the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue told officers that Jews were committing genocide and that he wanted them all to die. Pittsburgh police said in an arrest affidavit made public early Sunday that Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. A Pittsburgh police officer says in the warrant that Bowers was being treated for his injuries when he said Jews were "committing genocide to his people." Bowers is charged with 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The police affidavit says calls began coming in to 911 just before 10 a.m. Saturday, reporting "they were being attacked." ___ 12:30 a.m. A gunman who expressed hatred of Jews exploited a vulnerability common in so many houses of worship across the country — doors that are unlocked for worship — to target a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials say Robert Bowers was armed with a rifle and three handguns when he walked inside the Tree of Life synagogue during Sabbath services Saturday morning and opened fire, killing 11 people and wounding six in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Police swarmed the building and traded gunfire with the gunman, who was shot multiple times but survived. Four police officers are among the wounded. Bowers faces 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials plan to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning.

Her family and friends help juggle the childcare responsibilities. “It would take my entire salary just to pay for childcare,” she said. The lack of affordable childcare options is a problem plaguing cities... A children’s clothing store in Arden-Arcade caught fire Wednesday evening as people were shopping inside the business.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-pittsburgh-synagogue-20181027-story.html---split---A man with a history of posting anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant social media messages burst into a synagogue in Pittsburgh and opened fire on Saturday morning services that included a baby-naming ceremony, killing 11 people and wounding six more, authorities said. The shooting, which began shortly before 10 a.m., was probably “the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States” and marks a worrying new peak in violence against Jewish Americans in recent years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has monitored anti-Semitism in the U.S. for more than a century. It came just days after a flurry of explosive devices were mailed to prominent Democrats and other critics of President Trump, further ratcheting up a sense of tension in the nation in the closing weeks of an intense midterm election campaign. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors, who are investigating the killings as a hate crime, could seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter, who is in custody. The shooting unfolded over 20 minutes at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s placid Squirrel Hill neighborhood, known locally for being the historical hub of the city’s Jewish community; many residents had decorated their lawns in preparation for Halloween. The gunman, identified as Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns, officials said. The assailant wounded two of the first officers who arrived at the scene as he tried to leave, and later wounded two SWAT officers inside the synagogue before he was shot and taken into custody, officials said. During negotiations for Bowers’ surrender, an officer at the scene radioed that Bowers was saying that “all these Jews need to die.” Bowers had a history of making anti-Semitic posts on social media, and he had apparently signaled his plans to attack the synagogue in a post 17 days ago on Gab, a small social media service that is popular with white nationalists. On Oct. 10, an account bearing Bowers’ name posted a link to the website for HIAS, a refugee agency that was originally founded to assist Jews but that has expanded its work to include aid to refugees from around the world. The link Bowers shared included a list of congregations partnering with HIAS, including Pittsburgh’s Dor Hadash congregation — which holds services in the Tree of Life building. “We appreciate the list of friends you have provided,” Bowers wrote on Gab. Saturday morning at 9:49, Bowers published another post: “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.” Five minutes later, police received their first 911 call reporting a shooting inside Tree of Life Synagogue. The suspect remained hospitalized as of Saturday afternoon. He was charged in the evening with 29 counts of violence and firearms violations as rattled public officials vowed swift and severe justice. The charges included 11 counts of “obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death.” Bob Jones, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, called the shooting “the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” “Members of the Tree of Life Synagogue conducting a peaceful service in their place of worship were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," he said. Because the shooting is being treated as a hate crime, the FBI quickly took charge of the investigation, coordinating with local law enforcement, authorities said. Bowers probably acted alone and had no known criminal record, Jones said. Law enforcement officials familiar with the case confirmed that they believe the social media posts were made by the shooting suspect. Bowers’ reference to “optics” in the Saturday morning post is a significant one within the small world of white nationalists, signaling that the suspect had a familiarity with the political dynamics of the American white nationalist movement. It alludes to debate among far-right figures over whether to avoid violence or aggression, which often draws negative attention to the movement from the general public. Mark Hetfield, chief executive of HIAS, said he was "in a state of shock" to hear that his organization was named by the shooter. "It's horrible,” Hetfield said. The refugee resettlement group had organized a "refugee Shabbat" event last week at which more than 300 synagogues across the country came together to "celebrate our tradition of welcoming refugees." He said it was unclear whether the Pittsburgh synagogue had participated. "It's horrible that refugees are fleeing for aid, and the Jewish community is doing so much to embrace them and then this tragedy unfolds.” HIAS, founded in 1881 as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to assist Jews fleeing persecution in Russia, since 2000 has served a broad range of refugees of all faiths from around the world, helping them resettle in the U.S. President Trump, in his first comment to reporters on the shooting, called for armed guards at synagogues and implied that lax security by the synagogue was at least partially to blame for the high death toll. “If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better," he said. "If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him, frankly.” Local officials said they were unaware of any security hired by the synagogue. Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said local synagogues have done "lots of training on things like active shooters, and we've looked at hardening facilities as much as possible." “This should not be happening, period,” he told reporters at the scene. “This should not be happening in a synagogue.” Trump called the attack an “anti-Semitic act” that “shocked and stunned” the nation and the world. “It looks definitely like it’s an anti-Semitic crime. That is something you wouldn’t believe could still be going on,” he told reporters when he arrived in Indianapolis for a speech. Later, reading from a prompter while addressing the Future Farmers of America, Trump said: “Today with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti-Semitism and every other form of evil.” The president later issued an order calling for the American flag to be flown at half staff at all federal buildings through Oct. 31. Despite Trump’s reference to anti-Semitism as something relegated to the past, the ADL reported earlier this year that "anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. rose 57% in 2017 — the largest single-year increase on record and the second-highest number reported since ADL started tracking such data in 1979." Although small by the standards of Los Angeles or New York, the Jewish community in Pittsburgh is one of the nation’s oldest, and Squirrel Hill, a tree-lined residential neighborhood about 10 minutes east of downtown, has been its hub since the 1930s. About a quarter of the metropolitan region’s Jewish population, estimated at roughly 50,000, lives in the neighborhood, according to a study released earlier this year by Pittsburgh’s Jewish Federation. The synagogue is a large concrete building, its facade punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows. Among its treasures is a "Holocaust Torah," rescued from the former Czechoslovakia, according to its website. Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250, although on a typical Saturday, attendance would be much lower. Several hours after the shooting, a sharp smell of match strikes wafted over a crowd of several hundred, many holding candles, as they gathered a few blocks from the synagogue for a vigil organized by local high school students. Christian Nutini, 43, who lives near the synagogue, brought his children. The youngest sat on his shoulders holding a handwritten cardboard sign that said hate and violence are not the answer. He still didn’t know whether he knew anyone who was in the synagogue, but said he spent the day texting friends in the neighborhood. “As of right now, I don’t know,” Nutini said. But in a tight-knit community like Squirrel Hill, “I guarantee we’ll know somebody who knows somebody.” Jonathan Nadle, 53, of the Beechview neighborhood, said he had gone to donate blood earlier in the day, but so many people had shown up that the clinic had a two-hour wait. He said he’d go back tomorrow, and attended Saturday’s vigil instead. “You want to do something because you feel kind of helpless,” he said. Stuart Hoffman, 69, of Fox Chapel said he grew up going to the synagogue. “Squirrel Hill is the beating heart of the Jewish community of Pittsburgh,” he said. “It’s a wound to the heart.” Earlier in the day, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf called the shooting an "absolute tragedy." "We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life," Wolf said. "But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way." The banner image on the Gab account with Bowers’ name featured the number “1488,” a reference to the “14 words” embraced by white nationalists — commonly known as “we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children” — along with 88, which is numerical code for HH, or “Heil Hitler.” A spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremists, said, however, that the suspect “was not on our radar” before the attack. The shooting is likely to draw attention to Gab, a service that has repeatedly drawn controversy over the last year for its willingness to allow white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have been banned from more mainstream platforms such as Twitter. After the shooting, the payment processing service PayPal cut off its relationship with the social media site. Gab said in a statement that it was “saddened and disgusted by the news of violence in Pittsburgh,” and said it has a “zero tolerance policy” for terrorism and violence on the service. The service, which has often been criticized for hosting far-right users, also preemptively defended itself from another expected wave of public criticism after the shooting. “We refused to be defined by the media’s narratives about Gab and our community,” saying the service’s mission is “to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people.” Gab said it took “proactive action” to “immediately” contact law enforcement, including the FBI, and that “we are ready and willing to work with law enforcement to see that justice is served.” Wire reported from Pittsburgh and Pearce from Los Angeles.

United States Attorney Scott Brady, at podium, speaks with members of the media during a news conference in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH – The Latest on a deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue (all times local): 7:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady says federal prosecutors are seeking approval to pursue the death penalty against Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. Brady says he has begun the process to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions' approval as required by law to pursue a capital case against Bowers. Brady says multiple search warrants have been issued in the investigation of Bowers, a long-haul trucker who worked as an independent contractor. Police responding to the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue wounded Bowers and arrested him. Bowers is scheduled to appear in court early Monday afternoon for a hearing. ___ 7:15 p.m. Bernice and Sylvan Simon were always ready to help others, and "they always did it with a smile." That's how longtime friend Jo Stepaniak remembers her neighbors of decades in a townhouse community on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. Eighty-six-year-old Sylvan Simon was a retired accountant with a good sense of humor, the kind of person his former rabbi felt comfortable joking with after Sylvan Simon broke his arm a couple of weeks ago. Bernice Simon was a former nurse. Neighbors say the 84-year-old loved classical music and devoted time to charitable work. Emeritus Rabbi Alvin Berkun says both Simons were "an active, steady," and devoted presence at Tree of Life synagogue. The couple was among those massacred Saturday at the temple, where the Simons married in a candlelight ceremony in 1956. ___ 6:50 p.m. At least 2,000 mourners packed Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh and thousands more stood outside at a vigil for the 11 who were killed during Sabbath services at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said he began services at 9:45, and the shooting started a few minutes later. He said there were 12 in the sanctuary at the time, most sitting in the back. Myers said: "I helped pull out the people that I could from the front. But, alas, I had eight people in the back. One fortunately survived." Myers said: "I'm a survivor. I'm a mourner." He added: "Seven of my congregants were shot dead in my sanctuary. My holy place has been defiled." ___ 6:20 p.m. The rabbi of the New Light Congregation who is credited with shepherding some of the congregants behind a door and saving their lives during Saturday's shooting spoke at a vigil in Pittsburgh Sunday night. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman's voice cracked with emotion as he spoke of losing three pillars of the community who, he said, "would give you the shirt off their back." He said they volunteered not only at the synagogue but in the community at large. Said Perlman: "What happened yesterday will not break us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together." He added: "We will not be ruined by this event." ___ 5:55 p.m. Hundreds of people have gathered in the nation's capital to remember the 11 congregants killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. A vigil was held Sunday evening in Washington's Dupont Circle to pay tribute to those killed a day earlier at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Mourners sang and prayed together. Others held lit candles and held signs, including one that read "Tree of Life victims deserve better." Some in the crowd wept as the names of the 11 victims were read aloud. Police say the suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, told police he wanted to "kill Jews." Eight men and three women were killed when Bowers opened fire. The FBI said he was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns. Bowers faces federal and state charges. He's due in court Monday. ___ 4:25 p.m. Two brothers killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were an inseparable, warm-hearted pair who never missed Saturday services. That's according to ACHIEVA, an organization that provides services to people with disabilities and had worked with Cecil and David Rosenthal for years. ACHIEVA Vice President Chris Schopf recalls 59-year-old Cecil's infectious laugh and 54-year-old David's gentle spirit. Schopf says the two "looked out for one another" and were "kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around." Their sister is chief of staff to state Rep. Dan Frankel, who recalls seeing the brothers at Tree of Life whenever he went there. He calls them "very sweet, gentle, caring men." __ 4:05 p.m. Richard Gottfried was a devoted member of the New Light Congregation, going to the synagogue every Saturday morning without fail. He was killed Saturday as a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Stephen Cohen, the co-president of New Light, says Gottfried and another member who was also killed Saturday were the "religious heart of our congregation." "They led the service, they maintained the Torah, they did what needed to be done with the rabbi to make services happen," Cohen said. The 65-year-old Gottfried was also preparing for a new chapter in his life. The dentist, who often did charity work seeing patients who could not afford dental care normally, was preparing to retire in the next few months. Gottfried ran a dental office with his wife, Peg Durachko. __ 3:30 p.m. Israel's president is sending a message of solidarity after the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Israel stands with the Jewish victims and the Pittsburgh community. In a videotaped message set to open an interfaith vigil Sunday, President Reuven Rivlin will tell participants: "You are not alone! The people of Israel and the entire Jewish people stand with you!" That's according to a transcript of the message provided by his office. "We must say loud and clear — this was an act of anti-semitism," Rivlin says, according to the transcript. "We cannot, we must not, we will not ignore it or tolerate it." Rivlin, who acts in a mostly ceremonial capacity, will conclude his message of consolation by reciting the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. __ 2:50 p.m. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is joining the city's religious leaders and other elected officials to condemn the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and vowing to protect the city's Jewish communities from violence. The Democrat spoke outside a Manhattan synagogue Sunday afternoon with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, including Roman Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan and the Rev. Al Sharpton. De Blasio says the people of New York stand with the 11 victims of Saturday's shooting and their families. He says, "Violence against people because of their faith does not represent our values." De Blasio says city police will be out in force to protect synagogues and Jewish centers. __ 2 p.m. Daniel Stein, who was among the 11 people shot dead inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday, was a very visible member of the city's Jewish community as a leader in the New Light Congregation. The co-president of the area's Hadassah chapter, Nancy Shuman, says Judaism was very important to the 71-year-old Stein. His wife, Sharyn, is the chapter's membership vice president. Shuman says, "Both of them were very passionate about the community and Israel." Stein's nephew Steven Halle told the Tribune-Review that his uncle "was always willing to help anybody." Halle says Stein "was somebody that everybody liked." __ 1:45 p.m. Joyce Fienberg and her late husband, Stephen, were intellectual powerhouses, but those who knew them say they were the kind of people who used that intellect to help others. Joyce Fienberg was among the 11 victims of a gunman who opened fire inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday. The 74-year-old spent most of her career at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center. She retired in 2008 from her job as a researcher looking at learning in the classroom and in museums. She worked on several projects, including studying the practices of highly effective teachers. Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, who was Fienberg's research partner for decades, says she is devastated by the murder of her colleague and friend. Leinhardt says, "Joyce was a magnificent, generous, caring, and profoundly thoughtful human being." 1:30 p.m. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns have observed a moment of silence at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field for the 11 people killed by a gunman inside a synagogue in the city Saturday. There were other such tributes at NFL games elsewhere Sunday. Eight men and three women were murdered inside the Tree of Life Synagogue. The names of the victims, which included a pair of brothers and a married couple, were released Sunday. In a statement issued before Sunday's game, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said, "Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community." Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the slayings the "darkest day of Pittsburgh's history." __ 1 p.m. A law enforcement official says the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue had a license to carry firearms and legally owned his guns. The official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke Sunday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Police say Robert Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. The victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Court papers say Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Federal prosecutors have charged Bowers with 29 criminal offenses and state authorities have also leveled charges. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. — Michael Balsamo in Washington __ 11:40 a.m. Condolences and remembrances of the 11 victims of the deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday are beginning to roll out on social media and in emails. They were professors and accountants, dentists and beloved doctors. Former Allegheny County Deputy District Attorney Law Claus sent an email to his former coworkers Sunday asking them to pass along his condolences to the family of Jerry Rabinowitz, a 66-year-old personal physician. Claus says Rabinowitz was more than a physician for him and his family for the past three decades, saying, "he was truly a trusted confidant and healer." He says Rabinowitz had an uplifting demeanor and would provide sage advice. ___ 11:20 a.m. A neighbor of the man charged in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre says the suspect kept to himself. Chris Hall said Sunday that he never heard or saw anything to indicate that 46-year-old Robert Bowers harbored anti-Semitic views or posed a threat. Authorities say Bowers killed eight men and three women inside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday during worship services before a tactical police team shot and wounded him. Bowers faces state and federal charges. Hall says nothing stood out about Bowers. He says "the most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed." Six others were wounded in the attack, including four officers, one of whom remains in critical condition. Two worshippers also remain hospitalized, one of them in critical condition. ___ 10 a.m. The 11 people killed in the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh included a married couple, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, and two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal. The Allegheny County medical examiners' office released the victims' names Sunday. David Rosenthal was the youngest at 54. The eldest was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. The dead also included Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Jerry Rabinowitz, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax and Irving Younger. Fellow members of the New Light Congregation say Wax was a pillar of the congregation, filling many roles there. Friend Myron Snider says Wax was a retired accountant who was unfailingly generous. Wax was in his late 80s. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Bowers is being treated for gunshot wounds and is due in court Monday. ___ 9:30 a.m. Authorities have released the names of the 11 people killed by a gunman during worship services in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials said at a news conference Sunday that the victims ranged in age from 54 to 97 and included brothers and a husband and wife. Authorities say gunman Robert Bowers made statements about genocide and killing Jewish people. Officials previously said three women and eight men were killed. Bowers has been arrested and is being treated for gunshot wounds at a hospital. The U.S. attorney's office has charged Bowers with 29 federal counts. Bowers is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. State authorities have also leveled charges. ___ 8 a.m. German leaders are mourning the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and stressing the need to push back against anti-Semitism. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman quoted Merkel on Twitter as offering her condolences and saying that "all of us must confront anti-Semitism with determination — everywhere." President Frank-Walter Steinmeier voiced his dismay at the attack, which left 11 dead, in a condolence message to U.S. President Donald Trump. Steinmeier wrote that "this abhorrent crime reminds us all to do what is in our power to advocate against hatred and violence, against anti-Semitism and exclusion, and to counter with determination those who incite them." ___ 7:30 a.m. Pope Francis is grieving with Pittsburgh's Jewish community following the massacre at a synagogue, denouncing the "inhuman act of violence" and praying for an end to the "flames of hatred" that fueled it. Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter's Square, a day after a gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews opened fire in the synagogue during Sabbath services, killing 11 people. Francis prayed for the dead, injured and their families and said: "In reality, all of us are wounded by this inhuman act of violence." He prayed for God "to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies, reinforcing the sense of humanity, respect for life and civil and moral values." Francis has frequently spoken out against religiously inspired violence and has denounced the easy availability of guns thanks to weapons manufacturers, whom he has called "merchants of death." ___ 7 a.m. Police say the suspect in the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue told officers that Jews were committing genocide and that he wanted them all to die. Pittsburgh police said in an arrest affidavit made public early Sunday that Robert Gregory Bowers killed eight men and three women in the Tree of Life Synagogue before a tactical police team tracked him down and shot him. A Pittsburgh police officer says in the warrant that Bowers was being treated for his injuries when he said Jews were "committing genocide to his people." Bowers is charged with 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The police affidavit says calls began coming in to 911 just before 10 a.m. Saturday, reporting "they were being attacked." ___ 12:30 a.m. A gunman who expressed hatred of Jews exploited a vulnerability common in so many houses of worship across the country — doors that are unlocked for worship — to target a Pittsburgh synagogue. Officials say Robert Bowers was armed with a rifle and three handguns when he walked inside the Tree of Life synagogue during Sabbath services Saturday morning and opened fire, killing 11 people and wounding six in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Police swarmed the building and traded gunfire with the gunman, who was shot multiple times but survived. Four police officers are among the wounded. Bowers faces 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials plan to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning.

He said the woman had a swollen eye, a broken nose and blood all over her face. "She just kind of collapsed in my arms," Reed said. "She told me her boyfriend had just beaten [her] up." The woman didn't want Reed to call paramedics, but instead help her get to her motel room. So, that's what Reed did. He said he was h...

According to exit polls, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is leading in the election; however, support for the party declined significantly. According to the broadcaster ARD, the CDU polled 28%, while the Social-Democratic Party (SPD) won 20%, whereas their allies from the Green party managed to garner 19.5%. Angela Merkel’s CDU has thus lost a significant portion of the vote, dropping to 28% from 38.3% in 2013.

---split---21.0---split---http://time.com/5436829/multiple-casualties-shooting-pittsburgh-synagogue/---split---Authorities identified the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting after a gunman armed with an assault rifle and at least three handguns opened fire there on Saturday morning. Six others were injured in what authorities said was a hate crime targeting the city’s Jewish community. The suspect, identified as Robert Bowers of Baldwin, Penn., surrendered after exchanging gunfire with officers and then retreating inside the building. He has been taken into custody and was charged late Saturday with 29 counts related to federal hate crimes legislation, including 11 counts of obstruction of religious beliefs resulting in death. “Today the nightmare has hit home here in the city of Pittsburgh,” the city’s public safety director Wendell Hissrich said during an afternoon news conference. At an earlier appearance, verging on tears, Hissrich described the “horrific crime scene” inside the place of worship as “one of the worst that I’ve ever seen.” On Sunday, Allegheny County Medical Examiner officers released the names of the 11 victims, whose ages ranged from 54 – 97 years old and included a husband and wife and brothers. Authorities said Joyce Feinberg, 75, Richard Gottfried, 65, Rose Mallinger, 97, Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, Cecil Rosenthal, 59, David Rosenthal, 54, Bernice Simon, 84, Sylvan Simon, 86, Daniel Stein, 71, Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69, were shot and killed by Bob Bowers. Mourners and community members from around Pittsburgh arrived at the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill Sunday morning to pay their respects. Bouquets lined the grass outside the temple, a makeshift memorial in an area that continues to be cordoned off by police. Carl and Bella Schachter, Holocaust survivors, were among the mourners who visited the the memorial in the wake of the shooting. The couple, originally from Romania, has lived in Squirrel Hill for about 50 years after immigrating from Israel in 1968. “When I remember, I’m shaking,” Carl said, when asked about his immediate reaction to the news of the shooting. “Yeah, because we are Holocaust survivors,” Bella added. “This is the first thing we think about. I never thought we’d see something like this again. Never, especially in the United States.” The couple said they found out Saturday night that an unidentified family friend was a victim in the shooting while they were with his wife. “It was unbelievable. It was unbelievable, the pain,” Bella said, crying. “You run away from one place, you run to something else. When you see something like that, you cannot explain the pain that you feel.” Others arrived to show gratitude to those who helped in the aftermath of the shooting. Molly Butler and her two children, 6-year-old Lily and 9-year-old Mikey, arrived early in the day to pass out cookies and thank you notes to law enforcement officials who responded to the shooting. Butler, who has lived in Squirrel Hill her whole life and said her children are fifth generation residents of the neighborhood, said she knew a few families who were affected by the shooting. Butler, who attends Orthodox synagogue is a couple blocks down Tree of Life, noted that Squirrel Hill, which is reportedly home to more than half of Pittsburgh’s Jews, is the bedrock of the city’s Jewish community. “All different types of people live hand in hand in this community,” she said. “You’ll see Reform people and Orthodox people and Conservative people and Hasidic all living in the same spot, very integrated. Even though we are in our Orthodox synagogue, we knew people in the Conservative one.” Butler said she and her family were observing Sabbath and were limited in how much they could help out in the moment of the shooting. She decided the next day to show support and gratitude to the officers. Lily and Mikey held signs bearing a message to officers: “Thank you for keeping the Jews safe in my neighborhood.” Steven Schlossman and Stephanie Wallach came to the neighborhood from Mount Lebanon, Pa. a township close to the city. Schlossman, who teaches history at the nearby Carnegie Mellon University, said he has a friend who is closely involved with the Tree of Life, and that he felt he had to come out. Wallach, who also works at CMU as an administrator, said they both felt the temple is an extension of their community because they go through the area so much for work. “As Jews, we really bond together,” Wallach said. “Wherever you live, whatever sect of Judaism — just yesterday I was shopping in Giant Eagle in South Hills and a woman looked terribly upset down one of the aisles. We hugged each other. We’re both Jewish. And we just feel this bond. And you don’t actually need to be jewish to feel a bond with people right now.” Schlossman said that while he has not personally felt the impact of a rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S., the political climate has changed to allow room for such “hate-filled rhetoric.” “I very much see this in a broader context, with actions from the fringe, many of which have anti-Semitic groups.” The shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, an enclave reportedly home to more than half of the city’s Jewish population, is believed to be the single deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the U.S., according to the Anti-Defamation League. This occurs at a time when we've reported historic rises in both #antiSemitic incidents & #antiSemitic online harassment.

Bowers was not counted among the injured. Hissrich said the shooter was taken to a hospital in “fair condition,” and that there appears to be no further threat or any evidence of IEDs. ALERT: There is an active shooter in the area of WILKINS and Shady. Avoid the area. More info will be released when it is available. — Pgh Public Safety (@PghPublicSafety) October 27, 2018  Two of the injured officers were hurt in the first encounter with the gunman, which happened around 10 a.m., said Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert. None of the officers suffered life-threatening injuries, though two people remained in critical condition on Saturday afternoon, Hissrich said. Authorities said the shooter appeared to be working alone and that four weapons — an assault rifle reportedly similar to an AR-15 and three handguns — were found at the scene. Michael Eisenberg, the past president of the Tree of Life Synagogue, told KDKA-TV that the synagogue has never had threats or security concerns. “I’ve always had a very watchful eye because of what’s going on in the current climate, with the mail bombings… our security was that nobody has ever tried. “Because like most other religious places we have an open door.” Eisenberg said that the synagogue installed new doors so that people could exit more quickly following advice from homeland security officials. He said at least one person was able to escape the building because of those doors. Jonathan Greenblat, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks and advocates against anti-Semitism, said that the shooting was an anti-Semitic attack that targeted Jews on a Saturday morning when they would have been there for religious services. “We will work together with communities across the country to push back on prejudice wherever it appears,” he tweeted. We are devastated. Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable. Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community. — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) October 27, 2018  We are actively engaged with law enforcement to understand the extent of this anti-Semitic attack and we will work together with communities across the country to push back on prejudice wherever it appears. — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) October 27, 2018  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf was seen outside Tree of Life shortly after the shooting and said that his office was working with first responders at the scene. On my way to Pittsburgh. Headed to the scene at Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. The suspect is in custody. We are providing local first responders with whatever help they need. — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) October 27, 2018  President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and condemned the violence, but continued with his plans to attend a Future Farmers of America event in Indianapolis and a campaign rally Saturday for Rep. Mike Bost in Murphysboro, Ill. Trump acknowledged that the shooter appeared to target the Jewish community. “It looks definitely like it’s an anti-Semitic crime. And that is something you wouldn’t believe could still be going on. But it would seem to be an anti-Semitic crime,” Trump said after stepping off Air Force One in Indianapolis. The President addressed the shooting at the beginning of his Illinois rally, calling anti-semitism a “scourge” that needs to be dealt with. He also defended his decision not to reschedule, arguing that to do so would be a victory for the suspect. “We can’t allow people like this to become important,” he said. “When we change all of our lives in order to accommodate them, it’s not acceptable.” Trump also noted as part of his defense that the New York Stock Exchange opened the day after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But it actually opened six days later. Earlier in the day, Trump condemned the violence and advocated for the shooter to get the death penalty. But he demurred when asked about gun control, arguing that there should have been an armed guard at the Synagogue to prevent the shooting. “It’s a world with a lot of problems,” he said. “Certainly you want protection. They didn’t have protection. They had a maniac walk in.” Upon his return to Washington, the President ordered flags at federal buildings to be flown at half staff until Oct. 31 out of “solemn respect” for the victims. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted his prayers for the victims and their families. Monitoring reports of shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Praying for the fallen, the injured, all the families impacted, and our courageous first responders. God bless them all. — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) October 27, 2018  Attorney General Jeff Sessions also condemned the shooting on Saturday and described it as an attack based on religion. “Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society,” Sessions said in a statement. “Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety. Today 11 innocent people were suddenly and viciously murdered during religious services and several law enforcement officers were shot. These alleged crimes are reprehensible and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation. Accordingly, the Department of Justice will file hate crimes and other criminal charges against the defendant, including charges that could lead to the death penalty.” He added that the Department of Justice would “bring the full force of the law against anyone who would violate the civil rights of the American people.” The social media site Gab said the suspected shooter had an account on its site, which bills itself as a defender of free speech and is popular with far-right extremists. Before the shooting, the account linked to the suspect frequently posted about Jews and Jewish organizations, according to the New York Times. The account often targeted HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that helps resettle refugees. Shortly before the shooting on Saturday, the account posted: “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” After the shooting, Gab said it was alerted to the suspect’s profile, which was verified. The platform said it backed up the account’s data, suspended the account and contacted the FBI. The company also said it was ready to work with law enforcement and denounced the shooting. “Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,” the company said in a statement. When social media users pointed to the suspect’s Gab account, Gab went on the offensive on Twitter, pointing out other shooters who have used different social media platforms and asking what Twitter and Facebook have done to address hate on their platforms. Officials said resources have been opened up to families including a hotline for victim family members 412-432-4400 as well as a center set up at Chatham University on 106 Berry Street.

---split---21.0---split---https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-dead-1203006452/---split---TV news outlets scrambled Saturday morning to cover another horrific mass shooting after at least eleven people were slain at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The suspect, identified as 46 year-old Robert Bowers, surrendered to authorities shortly after 11 a.m. ET and is listed in “fair” condition. The shooting unfolded at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood while Shabbat services were under way as well as a bris ceremony, according to reports by CBS O&O KDKA-TV Pittsburgh. KDKA reported that police were able to rescue a number of people in the basement of the building but four were killed there. Bowers, an avowed anti-Semite, reportedly barricaded himself on the third floor of the building and exchanged fire with police before surrendering, according to KDKA.   Four police officers were among the others wounded during the siege, according to KDKA. Police said the death toll may yet rise. Bowers reportedly shouted anti-Semitic statements including “all Jews must die” after bursting into the synagogue shortly after 10 a.m., according to KDKA. Squirrel Hill is described as a largely Jewish neighborhood with numerous synagogues and schools in the area. Tree of Life Synagogue is of the conservative denomination.   Bowers, whose Twitter account was deleted shortly after the deadly shooting, had an active social media account on the neo-Nazi site Gab. His biography reads, “jews are the children of satan.” President Donald Trump condemned the shooting, saying “there must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism in America.” He also added that the synagogue would have been better protected had it had an armed guard on site. “They would have been able to stop him,” the President said. Saturday’s massacre joins the growing list of recent shooting rampages at houses of worship. In November 2017, 26 people were killed in a shooting at a church in rural Sutherland Springs, Texas. In 2015, nine African-Americans were slain while attending a Bible study class in a racially motivated attack on a church in Charleston, S.C. “This is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,” the ADL said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this violent attack – the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the United States since 2014 – occurs at time when ADL has reported a historic increase in both anti-Semitic incidents and anti-Semitic online harassment.” “This should not be happening,” Jeffrey Finkelstein, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, told KDKA. “This should not be happening in a synagogue. This should not be happening in our neighborhood in Squirrel Hill.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke out about the shooting on Twitter, and said there would be increased security in places of worship in L.A. on Saturday. “LAPD is stepping up patrols around places of worship today and we are reaching out to Jewish community leaders. We mourn with #TreeOfLife community today.”   TV news outlets scrambled Saturday morning to cover another horrific mass shooting after at least eleven people were slain at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.

Updated at 12:14 a.m. ET on Sunday Federal prosecutors have charged Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old suspected gunman who carried out a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, with 29 counts in the deaths of 11 people, The Associated Press reports. "Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe," Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, according to the AP, describing the massacre as a "terrible and unspeakable act of hate." Officials in Pittsburgh reported 11 people, none of them children, were killed in the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in what is being investigated as a hate crime. The federal charges issued to Bowers Saturday night include hate crimes and weapons offenses. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters six people were injured in the attack. Four police officers were among the injured. First responders surround the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a shooter opened fire Saturday morning. Gene J. Puskar/AP hide caption First responders surround the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a shooter opened fire Saturday morning. Bowers surrendered to the police inside the synagogue and was taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds but officials say he's in fair condition. His voice breaking, Hissrich said it was a "very horrific crime scene." "It's one of the worst that I've seen and I've been on some plane crashes," Hissrich said. "It's very bad." In a statement, the Anti-Defamation League called the shooting one of the deadliest attacks on the Jewish community in the history of the United States. Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Pittsburgh office, said that the investigation is still in the early stages, but that agents plan to look at everything in the suspect's life, including his social media activity and movements in the last few days.

Jones said authorities do not believe the suspect was known to law enforcement before the attack. Reports of a shooting began at about 9:54 a.m., just nine minutes after a Saturday service was scheduled to begin at the synagogue. Officers were dispatched to the scene at 9:55 a.m., according to law enforcement officials. Bowers was said to have been in the synagogue for about 20 minutes with an assault-style rifle and three handguns. As Bowers was exiting the synagogue, a Pittsburgh police officer engaged with him. The officer was subsequently wounded, and as he withdrew, the suspect went back into the synagogue in order to hide from a SWAT team that was moving toward the scene, according to officials. Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert praised the bravery of the officers who arrived on the scene. "Watching those officers run into the danger to remove people and get them to safety was unbelievable," Schubert said.

On his way to Air Force One on Saturday afternoon, President Trump addressed the shooting, remarking that if there were an armed guard inside the temple, the shooter might have been stopped. He also suggested that bringing "the death penalty into vogue" would help deter such attacks. Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, he said of the lack of an armed guard: "They didn't have any protection. They had a maniac walk in, and they didn't have any protection." He added: "And, that is just so sad to see. So sad to see. The results could have been much better." The president said the nation should "stiffen up laws in terms of the death penalty" in order to prevent such shootings from happening in the future. "I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue," Trump said.

"Anyone that does something like this to innocent people that are in temple or church, we've had so many incidents with churches ... They should really suffer the ultimate price, they should really pay the ultimate price. I've felt that way for a long time." Pennsylvania is one of 31 states where capital punishment remains legal, but it has been almost 20 years since the state has carried out an execution. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the shooting "reprehensible and utterly repugnant." Sessions said the Justice Department "will file hate crimes and other criminal charges against the defendant, including charges that could lead to the death penalty." Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America. Upon arriving at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, Trump again addressed the shooting in speech, saying it was "hard to believe" and "frankly something that is unimaginable." "This was an anti-Semitic act," Trump said. "You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don't seem to learn from the past." Vice President Pence commended law enforcement officers for their swift response. "There is no place in America for violence or anti-Semitism and this evil must end," Pence said at an event in Las Vegas.

He echoed Trump, agreeing that anyone who opens fire on worshippers should pay the ultimate price. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that he was "heartbroken and appalled" by the shooting. "The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead. We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded," Netanyahu said. Neighbors around the corner from the site of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue embrace one another.

According to the Tree of Life website, Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers usually leads its Saturday service. In July, Myers wrote an essay for the synagogue's website titled "We Deserve Better," which focused on several issues, including gun control. Myers wrote: "Despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that it would fade away in time. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the mid-term elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume. I shouldn't have to include in my daily morning prayers that God should watch over my wife and daughter, both teachers, and keep them safe. Where are our leaders?" The 11 victims killed in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning are part of the 289 people who have died so far as a result of a mass shooting in 2018, Vox reports. (The outlet cites data from the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as incidents in which at least four people, not including the shooter, are shot but not necessarily killed.)
