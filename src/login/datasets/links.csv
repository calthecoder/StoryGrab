---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/the-house-science-committee-may-soon-become-pro-science/---split---For the past eight years, climate science has been under a sort of spell in the House of Representatives. Instead of trying to understand it better or even acknowledging some of the field’s current uncertainties, House Science Committee Chairman Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) used his position to harass federal climate scientists with subpoenas while holding hearings on “Making the EPA Great Again” or whether “global warming theories are alarmist” and researchers are pursuing a “personal agenda.” But Smith retired this year and Democrats won control of the House on Tuesday. Now some on Capitol Hill say that the anti-climate science spell may be broken. “Hopefully we will no longer see the science committee used as a messaging tool for the fossil fuel industry,” says Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat and science committee member. “I look forward to hearings with a balance of witnesses that reflect mainstream scientific hearings instead of a small group of industry players.” Foster, who was a particle physicist before being elected to Congress in 2008, said he also wants to see more appearances from cabinet members like Energy Secretary Rick Perry or EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to explain both their budget and their rulemaking on environmental and science issues. Neither agency head was called before Smith’s committee during his tenure, Foster says. Ranking member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) issued a statement after the election results Tuesday night stating that, if elected chairwoman, she wants to restore the credibility of the science committee “as a place where science is respected and recognized as a crucial input to good policymaking.” Johnson said that includes acknowledging that climate change is real, “seeking to understand what climate science is telling us, and working to understand the ways we can mitigate it.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is in line to become Speaker of the House, hinted recently that she may push her members to form a new select committee on climate and renewable energy issues similar to one that operated from 2007 to 2011. Capitol Hill observers and advocacy groups, however, say it's not clear that a more science-friendly House will result in any new legislation getting passed or in stopping Cabinet heads that report to President Trump. “The attempt to embarrass the Trump White House isn’t going to work,” says Jeff Ruch, director of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an advocacy group representing federal workers in several scientific and environmental agencies. PEER has been litigating the EPA over the enforcement of pollution rules as well as the disclosure of ethics violations during the tenure of former administrator Scott Pruitt. Ruck says environmental and science policies need to be changed with votes, not hearings. He foresees some Democratic House members introducing what he calls “green riders,” climate- or energy-related amendments to larger, unrelated pieces of legislation that might be able to pass both the House and a Republican-controlled Senate. Others predict greater congressional oversight as well over issues including pollution enforcement, vehicle emissions standards, and the localized effects of climate change. “Too many people are seeing the impact of climate change in their communities, whether it's wildfires or drought or storms,” says Andrew Rosenberg, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based advocacy group. “So at some point members have to respond to their constituents.” If nothing else, there will be a greater representation of scientists and members with STEM degrees in the next session of Congress. Of the 14 House and Senate members endorsed and backed by the pro-science group 314 Action, eight won their general election race on Tuesday, while one, Seattle-area pediatrician Kim Schrier, holds a 52-48 percentage point lead with absentee ballots still to be counted. This mini-wave of STEM-trained politicians might result in more evidence-based policymaking, according to Shaughnessy Naughton, the founder and president of 314 Action. “They have a lot of credibility, whether it’s on the environment or health care, and it resonates with voters,” she says. Of course, climate deniers might still have a home on the north side of the Capitol, where the Senate meets and where Texas' Ted Cruz is expected to keep his gavel as chairman of the Senate Science Committee.

New poll shows people view the economy as good or excellent under President Trump. On 'Your World,' Tim Hockey says retail clients are buying into the dips of the market. Many years ago, Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving – was considered the official start of the holiday shopping season. Now, the first day of November is the true start of the holiday shopping season. America's economy is booming because President Trump has reversed failed Obama policies. The Dow suffered its worst monthly percentage drop since 2016, the S&P 500 had its worst month since 2011 and the Nasdaq saw its biggest percentage decline since 2008. Federal prosecutors say Chinese intelligence officers and hackers working for them have been charged with commercial espionage that included trying to steal information on commercial jet engines. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader.

The last-minute termination of a high-level meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart could signal a significant roadblock in the delicate denuclearization talks with Pyongyang, which has ramped up rhetoric in recent weeks by threatening to expand the Hermit Kingdom's nuke arsenal due to "arrogant" U.S. actions. Kim Jong Un has been framed. Leading Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday a fugitive tycoon accused of ransacking a state investment fund will be given a fair trial, while hinting that more former officials could be tried on corruption charges. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be traveling to New York on Thursday to meet with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol. Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced the end of the U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, as the administration restored a network of sanctions on the regime. Rich Edson explains on 'Special Report.' The Trump administration said it has taken its final steps to remove the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. As the full slate of US-imposed sanctions on Iran kicks back into effect on Monday – as a consequence of the Trump administration pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in May – civil unrest is expected to only deepen across the economically embattled nation. But from the vantage point of several Iranian women long opposed to the reigning religious regime, such unrest and protest is the only way to bring about change; even if it means life on the run as a labeled “terrorist.” Iran remained defiant Monday as the re-imposition of sanctions took hold in the Islamic Republic. While global migration levels are currently at an unprecedented high – characterized by graphic images of refugees on the run in the Middle East, caravans traversing Central America and flimsy boats from Africa capsizing in the Mediterranean Sea – far less confronting is the silent toll of those who never make it a border, those who die or disappear on often-dangerous expeditions.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drug-reform-groups-rejoice-after-trump-ousts-jeff-sessions-attorney-n933751---split---Marijuana proponents celebrated on Wednesday after the ouster of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose tenure as the nation's top law enforcer included stern policies on narcotics enforcement and sentencing. "He’s been an absolute disgrace on drug policy," said Michael Collins, interim director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, would serve as acting attorney general. Whitaker isn't well known to the drug reform movement. "We would welcome any attorney general whose policy ideas would move beyond the 1980s," Collins said. Sessions was reviled in the marijuana industry and drug reform movements for his move in January to rescind an Obama-era policy mandating a mostly hands-off stance for federal enforcement of U.S. cannabis law in states that have legalized the drug. The former senator also hit the brakes on sentencing reform policy. Sessions directed his federal prosecutors to seek maximum sentences for even low-level drug offenses. The lawman's policies came at a time when drug reform groups had gained momentum, with some states legalizing marijuana, others recognizing medical pot, and still more reducing sentences for small-time drug crimes. On Tuesday, Michigan became the tenth state to have legalized recreational cannabis. Another 32 have approved medical marijuana. The pro-cannabis community never had high hopes for Sessions, who once said "good people don't smoke marijuana," but his policies soon made him the legalization movement's biggest drag. "He certainly made negative comments" about pot, said Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project. His reversal of Obama's cannabis enforcement policy, Tvert said, sparked an exodus of investment in marijuana at a time when money is being drawn to the sector by state legalization. "It certainly had an impact on the market and investments — and resulted in deals falling through and people pulling money out of companies," he said. But reality on the street was that Sessions' bark didn't match his bite. For example, his edict to enforce federal pot law — marijuana is labeled by the Drug Enforcement Agency as a schedule 1 drug alongside heroin and LSD — didn't inspire his troops to act. After Sessons' Jan. 4 directive, the U.S. Attorney in Seattle, Annette L. Hayes, said in a statement that her prosecutors would continue to "focus on those who pose the greatest safety risk to the people and communities we serve." "The Justice Department's marijuana policy in practice hasn’t been that different than that of the previous administration," Tvert said. Kevin A. Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, agreed that there's been a certain continuum. He said a personnel change shouldn't affect the law. "This doesn’t change anything," he said via email. "Marijuana was against federal law before, during, and now after," Sabet said. Well, the legal weed industry is happy about Sessions departure. Marijuana index is trending sharply upward following the news. pic.twitter.com/YlyZhPNNVE Still, drug policy reform advocates would like to see an attorney general who reverses Sessions' pot enforcement mandate and who, like Trump, believes that cannabis legalization is a states' rights issue. "Our hope is the next attorney general will recognize that it is not politically popular to escalate the war on drugs," said Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance. Sessions' exit has already given a boost to marijuana stocks and investments. Micah Tapman, managing director at cannabis venture capital firm CanopyVentures, said recreational and medical campaign victories on Tuesday in Michigan and Missouri paired with Sessions' resignation Wednesday has had eager investors calling him on the phone. "We survived Sessions," he said, "and I think the future looks bright." Dennis Romero is a freelance reporter based in Los Angeles. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/comstocks-loss-spells-trouble-suburban-republicans---split---Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock lost her bid for a third term in the 10th District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) The defeat of Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock is a bad sign for other Republicans trying to hang on in well-educated, suburban districts where President Donald Trump is unpopular. Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton unseated the two-term Republican congresswoman Tuesday night. With 83 percent of precincts reporting, Wexton led Comstock 54 percent to 45 percent when The Associated Press called the race. Comstock has survived tough races before. She over-performed the president in 2016, when Hillary Clinton carried the 10th District by 10 points. She’d worked to distance herself from Trump and her party, voting against the Republican health care bill last year. But that didn’t stop Democrats from tying her to the president on health care. She did vote for the GOP tax overhaul, which was another source of Democratic attacks. Comstock was No. 4 on Roll Call’s latest ranking of the 10 most vulnerable incumbents. Also on the list were several other Republicans representing similarly suburban districts, where well-educated and affluent voters may be looking for a check on the president. Those Republicans include Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder and Minnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/midterms-florida-georgia-california.html---split---Supported by By Liam Stack Election Day is over, but by midday Wednesday, there were still races across the country whose outcomes were still in doubt. That included pivotal Senate contests in Florida and Arizona, the closely watched governor’s race in Georgia and House races in California, Utah and elsewhere. Here is a look at some important races that have yet to be decided. The Senate race in Florida is headed for a recount, according to Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent who is in danger of losing his seat. His Republican challenger, the sitting Gov. Rick Scott, was leading on Wednesday by 0.4 percentage points, or 34,537 votes. (In a statement, Mr. Scott called Mr. Nelson’s recount request “sad.”) The Senate race in Arizona has yet to be called. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Green Party activist who reinvented herself as a centrist Democrat, was trailing the Republican Martha McSally by 15,908 votes. In what some may see as a bitter twist, that is far fewer than the 38,597 votes that went to the Green Party candidate in the race, Angela Green. Local election officials raced on Wednesday to count absentee ballots in Georgia, where the governor’s race has not been called. On Wednesday morning, the Republican candidate, Brian Kemp, had a lead of 1.9 percentage points, or 75,386 votes, over the Democrat Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives. That puts him just slightly over the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff, an outcome that Ms. Abrams has said may be a possibility once absentee votes are counted. Another race in Georgia that was too close to call was the Sixth Congressional District, a seat once held by Newt Gingrich. On Wednesday, the Democrat Lucy McBath, who was motivated to run after her son was killed in an act of gun violence in 2012, was leading the Republican incumbent, Karen Handel, by 0.9 percentage points, or 2,872 votes. There were three House races in Southern California whose results were too close to call on Wednesday, all of them for longtime Republican seats. Two were in Orange County, which has long been synonymous with the California Republican Party. In the 39th District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino Counties, the Republican Young Kim was leading the Democrat Gil Cisneros. In the 48th District, in Orange County, the Democrat Harley Rouda was leading Dana Rohrabacher, the Republican incumbent known for his pro-Russia views and staunch support for President Trump. In the 50th District, outside San Diego, the Republican incumbent, Duncan Hunter, was leading the Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar by eight percentage points. Mr. Hunter, who was indicted in August on charges of abusing campaign funds, has been criticized for racially charged campaign tactics, including suggestions that his half-Palestinian opponent was a terrorist sympathizer. The House race in Utah’s Fourth District was too close to call on Wednesday morning. The Salt Lake County mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat, was leading the incumbent, Mia Love, the only black female Republican in the House, by 2.6 percentage points. Ms. Love spent much of the campaign battling accusations of campaign finance malfeasance. On Wednesday, President Trump criticized her by name at a news conference for what he described as her unwillingness to campaign alongside him.    A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/election-history-firsts-blackburn-pressley.html---split---Supported by By Karen Zraick There were historic firsts across the country on Tuesday night, as voters chose from a set of candidates that was among the most diverse ever to run in the United States. Native American, Muslim and African-American women, and L.G.B.T. candidates, were among those who broke barriers. Here are some of the winners who made history. (See election results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races.) In next year’s session of Congress, there will be at least 100 women in the House for the first time in history. Sharice Davids, a former White House fellow from Kansas, and Debra Haaland, a community activist from New Mexico. Ms. Davids is also the first lesbian Native American to be elected to the House and part of “a rainbow wave” of L.G.B.T. candidates in this year’s election. She has criticized the Republican tax bill and called for “a true tax cut for the middle class.” [More openly L.G.B.T. people were elected Tuesday night than in any previous election.] In her contest, Ms. Haaland drew parallels between the separation of Native American children and the federal government’s recent border actions with the families of migrants. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic state legislator in Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic former state legislator in Michigan, became the first Muslim women elected to Congress after winning their House races. Ms. Omar will also be the first Somali-American to serve in Congress. She has called for gun control, single-payer health care and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American attorney, has championed Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing the federal agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ayanna Pressley will become the first African-American woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress. She beat a 10-term incumbent in the Democratic primary and vowed to pursue “activist leadership” to advance a progressive agenda. Jahana Hayes, a school district administrator in Waterbury, Conn., will become the first African-American woman to represent Connecticut in Congress. Ms. Hayes, a Democrat, was a celebrated former history teacher who was chosen as the National Teacher of the Year in 2016. She will fill the seat previously held by Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat who said she had failed to protect women in her office from sexual harassment and did not seek re-election. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Like Ms. Pressley, she defeated a white male incumbent who had served 10 terms in a Democratic primary. She will represent New York’s 14th District, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. She has never held elected office but attracted support with an uncompromising left-wing platform. She won about 78 percent of the vote against her little-known Republican opponent. The candidates in the midterm elections are among the most diverse set to run in the history of the United States. Two Democratic women in Texas, Veronica Escobar of El Paso and Sylvia Garcia of Houston, will be the state’s first Latinas to serve in the House of Representatives. Their victories, both in seats previously held by Democrats, reflect the shifting demographics in Texas, particularly in urban areas. Ms. Escobar, a top elected official in El Paso County, will replace Representative Beto O’Rourke, whose spirited challenge for Senate against Ted Cruz fell short on Tuesday night. Ms. Garcia was a member of the Texas Senate. Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican closely allied with President Trump, will be Tennessee’s first female senator. She is fiercely anti-abortion, and stressed border security and taxes. Mr. Trump visited Tennessee to campaign for Ms. Blackburn three times, most recently at a rally in Chattanooga on Sunday. Jared Polis, a wealthy Democratic congressman in Colorado, became the first openly gay man elected as governor in any state. He wants to push for single-payer health care and renewable energy. Kristi Noem, a four-term Republican congresswoman who touted her experience working on her family’s farm and her conservative record in office, will be the first female governor of South Dakota. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for her at a rally in Rapid City on Monday night. Janet Mills, the Democratic state attorney general of Maine, will be its first female governor. (She was also the first woman elected as the state’s attorney general.) The former prosecutor was elected to the state legislature in 2002, and has vowed to combat the opioid epidemic and ensure access to health care. Lourdes Leon Guerrero, a successful bank executive in Guam and a Democrat, became the first female governor of the small United States territory in the Pacific. She was part of a wave of female candidates who won there on Tuesday, including 10 women elected to the 15-member Guam Legislature. Matthew Haag and Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.marketwatch.com---split---Thousands of campaigns on GoFundMe have raised money for their weddings. Nick Routley of the Visual Capitalist blog illustrates U.S. inequality by distilling 125 million American households down into 100 homes and color-coding them into $25,000 income increments: Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. fell more than 12% in the extended session Wednesday after the hotel and casino operator reported adjusted third-quarter earnings in line with expectations and quarterly sales that surpassed forecasts but in a subsequent call with analysts cast doubt on its Macau business in the fourth quarter. Wynn said it earned $156.1 million, or $1.44 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $79.8 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same period of 2017. Wynn pinned the better profit on an increase in operating income from Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau offset by a decrease in the company's Las Vegas operations. Adjusted for one-time items, Wynn earned $182.3 million, or $1.68 a share, compared with $155.8 million, or $1.52 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.71 billion, compared with $1.61 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Wynn to report adjusted earnings of $1.68 a share on sales of $1.67 billion. In the call, Wynn Chief Executive Matthew Maddox said the company does not anticipate losing share in its segments in China "but we do think that the premium end of the market is feeling softer and that's our expectation for the fourth quarter," according to a FactSet transcript. Roku Inc. shares dropped more than 10% in after-hours trading Wednesday despite a quarterly earnings report that topped expectations, as the company's profit projection for the holiday quarter came in light. Roku reported a loss of $9.5 million, or 9 cents a share, on sales of $173.4 million, up from a loss of $8.79 a share a year ago on revenue of $124.8 million. Analysts on average expected a loss of 12 cents a share on sales of $170.4 million, according to FactSet. For the holiday season, Roku projected sales in line with expectations, but forecast the bottom line in a range from a loss of $4 million to a profit of $3 million. Analysts on average were expecting fourth-quarter earnings of $7 million on average, according to FactSet; Roku reported net income of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Roku shares fell after the report was released in extended trading Wednesday. They closed with a 5.8% gain, receiving a boost late in the session after a CNBC report said Roku was talking with media companies about incorporating their offerings into Roku's streaming media channel, which Wednesday's letter to shareholders did not explicitly confirm. The stock is up 13.7% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index has gained 3.1%. TripAdvisor Inc. shares rallied in the extended session Wednesday after the travel site's quarterly earnings topped Wall Street estimates. TripAdvisor shares surged 12% after hours, following a 1.9% rise to close the regular session at $58.07. The company reported third-quarter net income of $69 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $25 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 72 cents a share. Revenue rose to $458 million from $439 million in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of 48 cents a share on revenue of $469.1 million. Monster Beverage Co. shares dropped as much as 9% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the energy-drink company revealed that beverage giant and partner Coca-Cola Co. could compete with Monster if it can win an arbitration fight. Monster shares were trading higher after the company reported quarterly earnings, but sharply dropped after Chief Executive Rodney Sacks said that Coke planned to release two new drinks that Monster considered competitive, which could go against a deal the two companies struck in 2015. The deal includes exceptions that Coke is trying to claim, Sacks explained, and the dispute entered into arbitration last week. Coke, which is the largest shareholder in Monster, has delayed the launch of its potential competitors until April 2019 amid the dispute, Sacks said. "We've agreed to go to arbitration civilly and determine what course of action is appropriate," Sacks said later in response to a question from an analyst. "So nothing has changed in the relationship and the manner in which this situation will be dealt with will be conducted from both parties on a civil basis according to the agreement." Analysts have suggested that Coke should fully acquire Monster to boost its presence in the energy-drink market. Shares bounced around during the call and were most recently down more than 5% in after-hours action.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/midterm-elections-2018-results-big-tech/---split---It may not have been the tsunami some expected, but the Democrats' long-promised blue wave was enough to carry the party to a majority in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The Senate, meanwhile, remained firmly in Republican hands. With control of the House, Democrats will be able to fulfill their promise to be a check on the Trump administration these next two years. And yet, the power split in the two chambers of Congress could make it harder than it already was to pass new legislation—even legislation with bipartisan backing. For the tech industry, that's both good news and bad news. The good news: As House Democrats spar with the Republicans in the Senate, the last thing either party will want to do is hand the other side a win. That means that until 2020, it will be much more difficult for Big Tech's critics on Capitol Hill to push through much-threatened regulations on the industry's ads or its monopolistic business practices. The bad news: There are some regulations that the industry desperately wants to pass, namely, a federal privacy bill that would preempt a much tougher bill in California, set to go into effect in 2020. Tech giants and industry groups like the Internet Association have been lobbying hard for a federal bill, and senators on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for some federal legislation. It's unclear at this stage whether a Democratic House would let President Trump be the one to sign off on such a historic law. The tech industry also faces a notably less cozy environment in the Senate after Tuesday night. Marsha Blackburn, for one, won her race in Tennessee. As a House representative, Blackburn battled tech giants at nearly every turn. Backed by the telecom industry, she opposed net neutrality protections and voted to overturn an Obama-era rule that would have required broadband providers to get people's permission before selling their browsing data. On the campaign trail, she took every opportunity to criticize the tech industry for alleged liberal bias. That's been a rallying cry in the House that Blackburn may well amplify in the Senate. If she does, she'll have a friend in Senator Ted Cruz. The Texas senator defended his seat against Democratic insurgent Beto O'Rourke, whose campaign was heavily financed by the tech industry. Like Blackburn, Cruz has seized on the opportunity to accuse tech giants of partisan censorship and recently skewered Google over its experiments in building a censored search engine for China. Former Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley, meanwhile, will replace Democrat Claire McCaskill in the Senate. Hawley, a Republican, took a tough stance on tech as attorney general, opening separate investigations into Google, Facebook, Uber, and Equifax over anti-trust and data privacy issues. Tuesday's race could also alter the dynamics of the congressional committees tasked with holding these companies accountable. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida was losing by a narrow margin to governor Rick Scott on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Nelson's campaign announced that, with just 0.4 percent difference between the candidates, the race would head to a recount. If Scott manages to hold on, Nelson's role as ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee would likely fall to someone like Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar or Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal, both of whom have voted to crack down on the tech industry. But the biggest shift will undoubtedly come in the House, where Democrats will take over control of the House Intelligence Committee, which was tasked with investigating foreign interference in American elections. Current ranking member Adam Schiff would likely take on the role of chair. He's vowed to pick the Russia investigation back up. Given the continued covert actions taken by Russia on social media platforms, such a probe could land Facebook, Google, and Twitter back in the hot seat. These new dynamics may not last long. In two years, Democrats will have to defend the House seats they won all over again. Thanks to a congressional map that's been gerrymandered to favor Republicans in states across the country, that won't be easy. On Tuesday, Democrats carved out a win by relying on states like Pennsylvania, where a badly gerrymandered map was recently replaced by a court-ordered one. And yet, the midterm elections also yielded wins for Democrats that could change the playing field in 2020 and beyond. A ballot initiative in Florida restored voting rights to more than 1 million former felons, who will now be eligible to vote in 2020. And anti-gerrymandering proposals passed in Colorado, Michigan, and Missouri, which would take redistricting power away from a single party and scuttle the maps all over again after 2020. By the early hours of Wednesday morning, both Democrats and Republicans were claiming a victory. Time will tell if tech's most powerful companies can do the same. 1 Updated 11/7/2018 11:25 AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect that the Senate race in Florida is heading to a recount.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/science-was-big-winner-tuesday-s-vote-n933761---split---Science may have been one of the biggest winners in Tuesday’s elections. At least seven new members of Congress have science, engineering, math, technology or medical backgrounds and six kept their seats. The Trump administration’s skepticism about climate change, proposed changes to health care and attacks on abortion rights and environmental protections started angering many scientists from the beginning — anger that brought thousands to the streets in 2017 for the March for Science across the country. But others decided to run for office, and a new crop will take their seats in January. Among them are Joe Cunningham, who used his background in ocean engineering to campaign against offshore drilling. Cunningham, a Democrat, beat ardent Trump supporter Katie Arrington and will represent South Carolina’s coastal 1st District. This one is HUGE for science, Democrats and the people of #SC01. Congratulations to ocean engineer @JoeCunninghamSC for a hard-fought campaign that was rooted in science. We're proud to stand with Joe and flip this seat for the first time since 1981. #electscientists pic.twitter.com/NzbGiFYS89 “We are pretty proud of these candidates,” said Shaughnessy Naughton, a former drug researcher who founded 314 Action, a political action committee that trains and supports STEM candidates for office. “Right now there are more talk radio show hosts in Congress than there are chemists and physicists,” Naughton told NBC News. She’s hoping new senators and representatives can bring a bit more science into the political process, which she feels has been dominated too long by ideology that is not always based in fact. Naughton is not sure how much they can accomplish. “As long as we have a president who denies the reality of climate change, it’s hard to see how we’ll get anything signed,” she said. Among the new winners: Three veteran physicians held their seats in the House – Republicans Michael Burgess of Texas and Andy Harris of Maryland and Democrat Ami Bera of California. PhysicanJoe Barrasso of Wyoming held his Senate seat. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat and trained physicist, won re-election, as did pharmacist Buddy Carter of Georgia and John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican with a chemistry background. Jerry McNerney, a mathematician and renewable energy specialist, held his California seat. Congratulations to RN @LUnderwood630 on a BIG victory in #IL14. Lauren’s background as a medical practitioner, policy adviser, and as a patient with a pre-existing condition will give her the tools to get to work on day one of taking office. #electscientists pic.twitter.com/EbrthoKSDy And the first registered nurse ever elected to Congress, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, was re-elected and is poised to take over as chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. She’ll replace fellow Texan Lamar Smith, a Republican who is retiring and who was detested by many critics for his efforts to limit research on the causes of climate change and for harassing government scientists. “We also had at least 31 state and local candidates win,” said 314 Action’s Ted Bordelon. Not every STEM candidate won. Health care entrepreneur Phil Bredesen lost to veteran Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee’s Senate race. Aerospace engineer Joseph Kopser lost to Chip Roy in Texas, who has denounced what he calls “hysteria” over climate change. And biochemist Randy Wadkins lost to Republican incumbent Trent Kelly in Mississippi.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-texas-senate-poll---split---Democratic Texas Senate candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke speaks during his campaign rally at the Gaslight Baker Theatre in Lockhart, Texas, on Oct. 1. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) The race in Texas is tightening. A new Quinnipiac University poll shows incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz maintains a 5-point edge over Rep. Beto O’Rourke. The race has become unusually close for a Republican stronghold as Election Day approaches. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month showed O’Rourke stalled at 9 points behind Cruz. “O’Rourke is within striking distance, but time is running out,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the poll. O’Rourke has attracted celebrity endorsements and achieved record-breaking fundraising totals in his bid to unseat the polarizing senator and 2016 presidential candidate. But Cruz maintains a slight advantage, in part due to a “gender gap,” Brown said: Male voters prefer Cruz over O’Rourke at a 56 percent to 39 percent margin, while female voters prefer O’Rourke over Cruz at just a 52 percent to 45 percent split. Independent voters prefer the Democrat 56 percent to 40 percent. That may not be enough to propel O’Rourke to victory, though, because there are few independent voters left to win over. Just 3 percent of likely voters told pollsters they didn’t know who they were leaning toward, and just 2 percent who have decided on a candidate said they might change their mind before heading to the ballot box. President Donald Trump was in Texas to rally support for Cruz last week, and the start of the polling period. Pollsters called 1,078 self-identified likely voters from Oct.22 through Oct. 28. Quinnipiac reported a 3.5 point margin of error. Watch: The Trump and Cruz Rally in Under 2 Minutes Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/news_women_in_congress---split---History was made in America on Tuesday with women winning more seats in Congress than ever before. It was the culmination of two years of resistance to President Donald Trump - primarily led by women - following his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The day after his inauguration, millions of women joined protests against him - a sign the #MeToo movement was inspiring a new generation of activists. As the mid-term elections approached, Democrats saw a surge of women who wanted to represent the party - a stark contrast to previous years when they appeared reluctant to enter politics. This led to suggestions that 2018 could become another “Year of the Woman” - a reference to the 1992 elections in which the number of women in Congress nearly doubled. That jump 26 years ago was put down to a controversy over claims of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee - a situation similar to the case of Brett Kavanaugh this year. So with most of the results in, here's a closer look at the numbers and what they mean. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders volunteer, is the youngest woman ever to win a seat in Congress. The 29-year-old, a Bronx native from a Puerto Rican family, overcame a top Democrat to become her party's nominee for a House seat in New York. This time last year she was working in a bar in Manhattan. In a video that launched her campaign, and quickly went viral, she said: "Women like me aren't supposed to run for office." Ilhan Omar, 37, is one of two Democrats to become the first Muslim-American women to enter Congress. She won a House seat in Minnesota. Born in Somalia, Ms Omar and her family fled the country's civil war in 1991. She arrived in the US as a teenager after spending four years at a refugee camp in Kenya. She is also the first Somali-American member of Congress. Speaking after her win, Ms Omar said Minnesota was delivering a clear message by sending a Somali refugee to Congress at a time when President Trump had banned Somalis from entering the country. Ms Omar will be joined in Congress by Rashida Tlaib, a Muslim woman who won a House seat in Michigan. The 42-year-old is also the first Palestinian-American congresswoman. Deb Haaland, 57, is one of two Democrats to become the first Native American women in Congress. Ms Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, won a House seat in New Mexico. During the campaign she spoke of her own struggles as a single mother relying on food stamps. The other Native American woman to be elected is Sharice Davids, a 38-year-old former mixed martial arts fighter. She is also the first openly gay women to represent Kansas.

As of early Wednesday afternoon, with a few tight races still left to call, there were at least 96 women elected to the House ― including at least 40 women of color ― reaching a historic high. Currently there are 84 women serving in the House of Representatives, according to the Los Angeles Times. The previous record high﻿ was 85 congresswomen, per the Congressional Research Service. Women already broke barriers in the lead-up to the general election, with a record number of women nominated in 2018, including an unprecedented number of women of color. Several women elected to Congress on Tuesday night will be sure to go down in America’s history books: Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota became the first Muslim women elected to the body, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York became the youngest congresswoman ever, at age 29. Ayanna Pressley became the first black congresswoman out of Massachusetts. A wave of women was inspired to run for office for the first time after Donald Trump won the presidency. Trump has had an ongoing history of making sexist comments about women and has also been accused of sexual misconduct or assault by more than 20 women.

And a majority (55%) say they are worried that they, a family member or close friend could be deported. Many blame the current administration for what they see as the worsening situation of Hispanics, the nation’s largest minority group. Two-thirds (67%) say the administration’s policies have been harmful to Hispanics – a much higher share than during the administration of either Democrat Barack Obama (15% in 2010) or Republican George W. Bush (41% in 2007).2 Overall, six-in-ten Hispanics (62%) say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today, up since 2017 and the highest level since the Great Recession a decade ago, when 70% of Hispanics said they were dissatisfied with the nation’s direction. And yet, attitudes among Latinos are not monolithic. Slightly less than a quarter of Latinos (23%) identify as Republican or describe themselves as leaning Republican. Among this group, six-in-ten (59%) approve of President Trump’s job performance, compared with just 8% of Latino Democrats who say the same.3 In addition, half as many Latino Republicans as Latino Democrats (28% vs. 57%) say the Hispanic population’s situation has grown worse over the past year. Notably, partisan differences do not extend to voting. In each partisan camp, about six-in-ten (59%) registered voters say they are more enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterms than in the last congressional elections. This year, more than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote, up from 25 million in 2014. Half of Hispanic adults (49%) are foreign born, and as a group they have stronger concern than those born in the U.S. Immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics to say they have serious concerns about their place in U.S. society (57% vs. 42%), and they worry a lot or some about deportation (66% vs. 43%). Foreign-born Hispanics are also more pronounced in their criticism of the Trump administration: 71% say White House policies have been harmful to Hispanics as a group, compared with 63% of U.S.-born Hispanics who say the same. These are among the key findings from a new nationally representative, bilingual telephone survey of 1,501 Hispanic adults, conducted by cellular and landline telephone from July 26 to Sept. 9, 2018, by SSRS for Pew Research Center. The survey’s margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence interval. Latinos’ downbeat assessments extend to their own economic situations. Asked about their personal finances, only a third rate their situation as excellent or good, down from 40% who said the same in 2015. And when it comes to the next generation, the share who say their children will be better off financially than they are has declined from 72% to 54% over the same three-year period. These signs of waning economic confidence contrast with government data showing Latino unemployment at historic lows and Latino household incomes increasing faster than for other groups. Beyond economic considerations, a majority (54%) of Hispanics say it has become more difficult in recent years to be Hispanic in the U.S. This feeling is even more pervasive among foreign-born Hispanics (64%) than among the U.S. born (44%). And nearly four-in-ten Hispanics say they have experienced at least one of four offensive incidents in the past year because of their Hispanic background, although about as many note that someone has expressed support for them because they are Hispanic. For the 38% of Hispanics who say they have experienced an incident, these comprise: experiencing discrimination or unfair treatment because of their Hispanic background, being criticized for speaking Spanish in public, being told to go back to their home country, or being called offensive names. Immigrant Hispanics are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics to report they have experienced most of these incidents. Individual experiences of discrimination notwithstanding, the survey finds Hispanics are overwhelmingly proud of their heritage (97%). Strong majorities also express pride in being American (84%). Asked if they could do it again today, 70% of Hispanics born in another country or in Puerto Rico said that they would migrate, or leave Puerto Rico, for the U.S. They also continue to see the U.S. as a better place to get ahead (85%) and a better place to raise children (73%) than their countries of origin or Puerto Rico. The nation’s Latino population stands at nearly 59 million and is one of the youngest and fastest-growing groups in the U.S. Its composition is also changing as the foreign-born share has fallen and U.S. births now drive growth. Overall about one-third of all Latinos are foreign born. Among the about 19 million Latino immigrants, some 8 million are unauthorized immigrants.  The terms Hispanic and Latino are used interchangeably in this report. U.S. born refers to persons born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, and those born elsewhere to at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen. Foreign born refers to persons born outside of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories to parents who were not U.S. citizens. The following terms are used to describe immigrants and their status in the U.S. In some cases, they differ from official government definitions because of limitations in the available survey data. First generation refers to foreign-born people. The terms “foreign born,” “first generation” and “immigrant” are used interchangeably in this report. Second generation refers to people born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, with at least one first-generation, or immigrant, parent. Third and higher generation refers to people born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories with both parents born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories. Language dominance is a composite measure based on self-described assessments of speaking and reading abilities. Spanish-dominant people are more proficient in Spanish than in English (i.e., they speak and read Spanish “very well” or “pretty well” but rate their English-speaking and reading ability lower). Bilingual refers to people who are proficient in both English and Spanish. English-dominant people are more proficient in English than in Spanish. Hispanic Republicans and Hispanic Democrats refers to those who identify as or lean toward one of the two major political parties. Eligible voters or the voting eligible population are persons ages 18 and older who are U.S. citizens.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-flip-sanford-seat-coastal-south-carolina---split---Joe Cunningham has won South Carolina's 1st District. (Courtesy Joe Cunningham for Congress) Democrat Joe Cunningham’s win in South Carolina’s 1st District is a blow to Republicans who thought they’d hold on to the coastal seat even after South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford lost a GOP primary earlier this year. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Cunningham led GOP state Rep. Katie Arrington 51 percent to 49 percent when The Associated Press called the race. President Donald Trump carried this Charleston-area seat by 11 points in 2016. But there were signs the race was becoming increasingly competitive this fall, with some internal polling pointing to a close contest. Offshore drilling — which Sanford opposed and Arrington said during the primary that she supported — became a central part of the general election contest. National Republicans made a late investment on TV late in the final weeks to attack Cunningham. The Democrat, meanwhile, had attracted support from 314 Action, a group that supports scientists running for office. 314 Action’s political arm invested nearly $500,000, running ads on broadcast TV. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had added Cunningham to its list of Red to Blue candidates for strong recruits in August. Cunningham outraised Arrington, who kicked personal money into her campaign. Cunningham did not self-fund and did not accept any money from PACs. He had the endorsement of End Citizens United but returned the Democratic PAC’s check. Arrington had defeated Sanford, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, in the June GOP primary. She’d secured the backing of Trump on primary day. While Sanford was a noted critic of the president, Arrington embraced him — perhaps too much for this district. Sanford declined to endorse her in the general election. In a moment of major significance for this race, Arrington said during the primary that she supported Trump’s effort to lift the ban on offshore drilling. She repeatedly attempted to walk back those comments, but it became fodder for Cunningham and his allies. Cunningham picked up the endorsement of several area Republican mayors because of his opposition to offshore drilling.

(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the most likely next speaker of the House are not strangers. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and McConnell have had to work together over the years, as long-tenured leaders of their respective conferences. And McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, noted their history goes back many years before that. “She and I actually have had some — an opportunity to work together for a number of years when we were both on the Appropriations Committee,” McConnell said. “She had the Foreign Operations subcommittee and so did I, and so we’re not unfamiliar with each other.” That should give a clue that McConnell and Pelosi will continue to prioritize getting a functioning appropriations process along with President Donald Trump. McConnell put finishing up the fiscal 2019 spending bills and a House-Senate agreement on the farm bill on the top of the “lame duck” legislating list. McConnell said Tuesday that he had already spoken to Nancy Pelosi about working together on infrastructure, as well. “When we do things together, it almost never makes any news,” McConnell said. “There are plenty of things we work together on, and I always have to tell constituents who think we all hate each other, that the Senate’s a pretty collegial place.” As for the Senate, McConnell confirmed the obvious that with his new larger majority and a GOP-led House he will continue to prioritize the confirmation of Trump’s judicial nominations.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/over-100-lgbtq-candidates-claim-victory-midterm-elections-n933646---split---As the sun set on Washington on Tuesday evening, a rainbow appeared over the Capitol. LGBTQ candidates and advocates hoped it was an early sign that a figurative “rainbow wave” would sweep a historic number of lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer candidates into office. Their hopes were arguably fulfilled. With many races still too close to call, more than 100 LGBTQ candidates emerged victorious in the midterms as of Wednesday afternoon. For perspective, there are currently less than 600 openly LGBTQ elected officials in the U.S. — just 0.1 percent of elected officials nationwide, according to the Victory Institute. “This election is shaping up to be truly historic for LGBTQ candidates," Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the national LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, said in a statement shared with NBC News. Four LGBTQ candidates ran for governor, all Democrats, and two are projected to win. In Colorado, with 90 percent of the votes in as of Wednesday evening, NBC News reported that Jared Polis is ahead of his Republican challenger, Walker Stapleton, with nearly 52 percent for the vote. Polis is set to become the first openly gay man elected governor in the U.S. Patrick Egan, a politics professor at New York University, called Polis’ victory a “remarkable turnaround” for the Centennial State, which in 1992 “was home of Amendment 2,” which prohibited recognition of homosexuals as a protected class. And just over a decade ago, the state also passed Amendment 43, which prohibited same-sex marriage. “That says something about the transformation of that state, and of our country, when it comes to how voters think about LGBTQ candidates and LGBTQ rights,” Egan said. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a bisexual Democrat who in 2016 became the first openly LGBTQ person to be elected governor, was also projected to win her race. With 99 percent of the vote in on Wednesday afternoon, Brown was 6 percentage points ahead of Republican Knute Buehler. Lupe Valdez, a lesbian Latina running in Texas, and Christine Hallquist, a transgender woman running in Vermont, were both projected to be defeated by their Republican challengers. “The big disappointment of the night is Christine Hallquist,” Egan said, noting that she faced a popular Republican incumbent, Gov. Phil Scott. “But I don't think it takes anything anyway from her historic candidacy.” The are currently seven openly LGBTQ members in Congress: Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo.; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.; Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.; Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.; Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis.; and Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. The incoming 116th Congress will welcome several new LGBTQ members, though the overall number of out members will only increase slightly, as some members — like Polis — have sought higher office. Baldwin, the first openly LGBTQ person elected to the Senate, was projected to win re-election. Sinema was running for the Senate, but her race was still too close to call as of Wednesday evening. If Sinema wins, she will be the first openly bisexual person elected to the Senate and the first female senator from Arizona. Of the estimated 20 openly LGBTQ major party candidates running for the House, seven won and one is still too close to call. The incumbent winners include Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif.; Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.; and Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. The new LGBTQ House members include Democrats Sharice Davids of Kansas, Angie Craig of Minnesota and Chris Pappas of New Hampshire. With nearly all of the precincts reporting, California Democrat Katie Hill is leading in her race for the state’s 25th Congressional District against incumbent Republican Stephen Knight. While NBC News has not yet projected a winner in that race as of Wednesday evening, Knight has reportedly conceded the election. When all the races are called, the number of LGBTQ members in both houses of Congress will climb slightly to eight or nine. “This is a historic night in the fight for equality,” Rep. Cicilline said in a statement. “We will enter the 116th Congress with an unprecedented number of LGBTQ members.” “We are also celebrating the rise of a Democratic majority,” Cicilline continued. “Issues important to LGBTQ Americans, like the Equality Act’s protection from discrimination and equal and affordable access to health care, will now be top priorities for the People’s House. The LGBTQ members of Congress are ready to lead in the House to ensure equality for all across this country.” The wins by LGBTQ challengers helped give control of the House to Democrats. Democrats needed to pick up 23 seats to take control of the House, and as of Wednesday morning, they had picked up 28. Pappas won his race by a landslide to hold a Democratic seat and represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, a district Trump won by 2 percentage points. With the win, Pappas becomes the first openly gay person to represent New Hampshire in Congress. Democrat Sharice Davids flipped her district in Kansas against four-term incumbent Republican Kevin Yoder to become the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Kansas and one of the first two female Native Americans elected to Congress (along with newly elected Debra Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico). “Tonight Kansas voters gave the boot to a Trump ally and replaced him with a groundbreaking LGBTQ leader who spoke her truth throughout the campaign,” former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, now the president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, said in a statement sent to NBC News. “Sharice’s victory tonight will become a model for other LGBTQ leaders considering a run for office in red states or districts.” Likewise, Angie Craig of Minnesota beat incumbent Rep. Jason Lewis, picking up an important seat for the Democrats. She also will be the first openly LGBTQ mother in Congress. “Angie’s victory is a historic moment that redefines what is possible for an LGBTQ person in Minnesota, and it is made even sweeter given she defeated one of the most homophobic and transphobic incumbents in the U.S. Congress to pull it off,” Parker said. State legislatures across the U.S. will elect a record-breaking number of LGBTQ representatives, according to Andrew Reynolds, professor of political science at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. There have never been more than 119 openly LGBTQ state representatives nationwide, but with 32 newly elected legislators, the total will hit 129, according to Reynolds. There were also several notable firsts in statehouses across the country. Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana will welcome the first-ever LGBTQ legislators. In Kansas, Susan Ruiz and Brandon Woodard won seats in the Kansas House of Representatives. In Nebraska, Megan Hunt became the first openly LGBTQ candidate ever elected to the state legislature, and J.D. Ford defeated Republican Mike Delph, a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage, to become the first LGBTQ candidate elected to Indiana’s General Assembly. Neil Rafferty won his race in the Alabama House of Representatives, Mary Washington will become the first only LGBTQ person of color elected to the Maryland Senate, and Malcolm Kenyatta is the first openly gay black man to win a seat in the Pennsylvania legislature. “The rainbow wave touched down in state capitals throughout the country on Election Day — with an astounding number of out LGBTQ candidates shattering long-standing political barriers and becoming historic firsts,” Parker said. “While our attention is often focused on Donald Trump and Congress, it is in our state legislatures where the most horrific attacks on LGBTQ equality are occurring. But personal relationships matter in these legislative chambers, and we know out LGBTQ officials significantly influence the votes of their colleagues on equality issues.” State-level representation matters because of the number of anti-LGBTQ bills that have been introduced in the past several years. In 2017, 129 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced across 30 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign, 12 of which became law. Two transgender women, Lisa Bunch and Gerri Cannon, also won their elections in New Hampshire, effectively tripling the level of transgender representation in statehouses across the U.S. Danica Roem, who in 2017 became the first transgender person elected to a state legislature, congratulated both Bunch and Cannon. And congratulations to New Hampshire state Rep.-elect @LisaBunker too! There will now three out-and-seated transgender state legislators in the United States soon with NH state Rep.-elect @GerriCannon in the winner’s circle too! https://t.co/TVE7OpoNNX There are still more transgender candidates running in statehouse races that have yet to be decided, according to researcher Logan Casey, who tracks transgender political candidates nationally. These candidates include Everett Maroon of Washington, Amelia Marquez of Montana, Briana Titone of Colorado and Lasia Casil in Guam. A number of transgender candidates were also successful in local races for city council and school board. Egan said that candidates’ LGBTQ identities were not a significant issue in any of the races. “The dog that didn't bark is definitely something of note, and that’s definitely something good about 2018 and where we stand on these things,” he said.

It was to let you know, This is my show, this is my shit, and I want to prove to you that it’s my shit and I’m going to show you how much power I have over you by saying I’m going to control your lives,” she told Cosmopolitan. “It’s so much bigger than that even though, you’re right, it was extremely sexist.” O’Day said that Combs didn’t like openly “being challenged” by the women and that the show pitted the members against one another. “Puff plays one of the dirtiest games there is around and that’s what we were exposed to at 17 years old,” she said. O’Day doesn’t have particularly fond memories from her time competing on the fifth season of “Celebrity Apprentice,” during which it was rumored that she began an affair with Donald Trump Jr. She said she was once informed by that show’s producers that Donald Trump Sr. thought she was “ugly” and encouraged her to dress more suggestively for the camera. “He’s wanting to get rid of you. He wants to keep the dumb Miss Universe around because she’s really pretty and she’s hot and he thinks that we’ll do better,” O’Day recalled the producers telling her. “She gets more ratings.” Similarly, Richard recalled famed record producer Jimmy Iovine disparaging her and her onetime fellow Dirty Money member Kalenna Harper’s looks in a meeting with 50 people and asked Combs why he didn’t choose “two light skinned girls.” After a failed reunion in 2013, O’Day, Bex and Richard announced in August 2018 they would be going on a reunion tour together, now with total creative control over their careers. “Look at after all of that, we’re back together and we just did an incredible show that featured all of us in our greatness,” O’Day said. “Imagine had he made us believe in it at that age, what we could be right now.” To read the full profile, head over to Cosmopolitan.
---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/post-election-day-pentagon-drops-border-support-mission/story?id=59032060---split---The day after a mid-term election in which President Trump played up the Pentagon's mission to provide logistical support along the southern border, the Pentagon said Wednesday it will no longer publicly refer to the mission as Operation Faithful Patriot. Instead, the deployment of active duty troops will be referred to as what it's always been: a border support mission. “We are not calling it Operation Faithful Patriot, we are calling it a border support mission,” said Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The name had been used by U.S. Northern Command for the 45-day deployment of more than 7,000 active duty personnel to support Customs and Border Protection (CBP) along the border ahead of the arrival of migrant caravans making their way to the border from Central America.     A U.S. official said the change occurred Tuesday at the request of Defense Secretary James Mattis. It was unclear if the timing of the request was tied to Election Day or if it was merely coincidental. Two other officials said that the military can still use Operation Faithful Patriot internally, but not in public communication. One of the officials said this was being done to highlight that the military was not the lead for the mission, but was providing support to CBP along the border. In the leadup to Tuesday's midterm election, President Trump often highlighted the deployment of active duty troops to the border support mission, though he did not refer to it as Operation Faithful Patriot. But he often seemed to highlight it as more than a border support mission to CBP, particularly after active duty troops placed concertina wire along some ports of entry in Texas this weekend.   "Barbed wire looks like it's going to be very effective, too, with soldiers standing in front of it," Trump told a campaign rally in Cleveland. Senior military officials have stated repeatedly that the active duty troops are only along the border in a support role to CBP.   "You’ll see some soldiers down there, right now, putting up concertina wire and reinforcing the ports of entry,' Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Monday. "We’re providing both trucks and helicopter support and also some medical support," said Dunford. "There is no plan for U.S. military forces to be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States," he stressed. " There is no plan for the soldiers to come in contact with immigrants or to reinforce Department of Homeland Security as they are conducting their mission. We are providing enabling capability." U.S. Northern Command had been using #FaithfulPatriot #OFP and #OperationFaithfulPatriot on its Twitter account, but they had not been used on Wednesday.  Gen.

Paul Mckenna, command senior enlisted ldr, visited @DMAFB, Ariz., to meet with key leaders & Soldiers deployed providing @DeptofDefense support to Customs and Border Protection at the Southwest Border. #CBP pic.twitter.com/hq35q7v4Dd  However, Operation Faithful Patriot was still being used to describe the mission to the Pentagon's Operation Faithful Patriot imagery and video website.

---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-2018-midterm-elections/story?id=59024592---split---While Democrats didn’t secure the so-called “blue wave” across both chambers, the midterm results will certainly bring a sea-change to Washington. Democrats, who needed to net 23 seats to take the House, are expected to surpass that number by more than 10, flipping the chamber blue. But in the Senate, Republicans not only maintained their majority — they bolstered it, with key victories projected in senate races in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri.     Beyond the numbers that continue to flesh out in the House and Senate, a number of individual candidates pushed through the election night noise to make history — and women were elected in record numbers. Additionally, exit polls revealed key issues on voters’ minds — and health care, which voters largely favor the Democrats to control, is number one.     Here are the key takeaways:  The House flipped blue well before results were in from California — one of the largest, traditionally blue states in the country. Democrats, who needed a net gain of 23 seats to take control of the House, are expected to grab between 32 and 36 seats, according to a projection by ABC News.   “We’ve become a 50 state party again,” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, mentioning races won in traditionally red districts. One such district that showed the range of seats Democrats were able to flip was in the deep red state of Oklahoma, in the state's 5th Congressional District. Trump won the district by roughly 13 points in 2016 and won the state of Oklahoma overall by just over 36 points in the 2016 election — but Democrat Kendra Horn was projected to defeat incumbent GOP Rep. Steve Russell in an upset, based on vote analysis. In New York, another House seat flipped in an unexpected victory for the Democrats in the 11th district, which Trump won in 2016. Democrats’ hopes were also bolstered in Virginia, where Elaine Luria — one of the first woman to serve her entire career on a Navy combat ship — was projected to win in a district long held by a Republican. In Kansas, Sharice Davids was projected to defeat Republican incumbent Rep. Kevin Yoder — becoming the first Native American lesbian woman in Congress.  Democrats couldn’t carry the so-called “blue wave” over to the second chamber of Congress, leading to a split in governance, and instead suffered significant losses in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri that bolstered the Republican majority. Incumbent Sens. Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill — all Democrats representing states that Trump won in 2016 — were projected to lose their seats to Republicans Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer and Josh Hawley, respectively, all of whom were backed by the president’s endorsement.     Of the eight seats ABC News rated likely or solid Republican, Democrats were unable to flip any — though one of those races, a special election in Mississippi, is projected to go to a run-off between Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy. Democrats did flip the Senate seat in Nevada, which incumbent Sen. Dean Heller conceded to Democrat Jacky Rosen -- who will be the second female senator in the state's history. ABC News has not yet projected the race.    ABC News projects 110 women will win seats across both chambers of Congress, with 98 women projected to win in the House and 12 women projected to win in the Senate. The numbers mark a new all-time high for the number of women in the chamber, which currently stands at 107, with 84 women in the House and 23 in the Senate. All 435 seats in the House and about a third of the seats in the Senate were up for re-election, but so far, 34 of the 110 women projected to win are newly elected members of Congress. 32 women projected to win in the House and two women projected to win in the Senate will be new members. The majority of the female winners were from blue states, with 84 Democrats and 14 Republicans projected to win in the House. In the Senate, the breakdown is 10 Democrats and two Republicans. In Pennsylvania, a record-breaking four women are projected to win House seats and head to Washington, D.C., where not a single woman currently represents the state.   Female candidates also made inroads in a handful of gubernatorial races. Women were projected to win in nine gubernatorial races across the nation — matching the current record. ABC News has not yet predicted the governor's race in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abram faces Republican Brian Kemp. History-makers Across the country, great strides were made to increase diversity in the Senate, House and governor’s seats. ABC News projected two Muslim women will be elected to seats in Congress — Rashida Tlaib, projected to win in Michigan, and Ilhan Omar, projected to win in Minnesota, both Democrats — as well as the two Native American women, Sharice Davids of Kansas and Debra Haaland of New Mexico, both Democrats. Omar, who will represent Minnesota's left-leaning 5th Congressional District, will also be the country’s first Somali-American member of Congress.     And from Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District, Davids will not only be one of the first two Native American women in Congress — but also the first Native American, lesbian member of Congress. In Colorado, Democrat Jared Polis, a five-time congressman, is on track to become first openly gay man to win a U.S. gubernatorial race, claiming victory in the Colorado governor's race.   And though it was expected because she ran unopposed, Ayanna Pressley has become the first black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Congress.   Voter diversity also broke records, according to results from ABC News' national exit poll, displaying the changing racial and ethnic face of the nation. In the 1990 midterm elections, whites accounted for 91 percent of the vote, while nonwhite voters were just 9 percent. This year, nonwhites accounted for 28 percent of voters, the highest ever for a midterm and 1 point from the record in any election, which was set in 2016.  Health care, over three other key issues voters were asked about, was front and center for constituents this election, preliminary exit poll results showed. Some 41 percent of voters picked health care as the top issue facing the country, compared with 23 percent for immigration, 22 percent for the economy and 10 percent for gun policy.   It was the top issue in closely watched states, including in Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Missouri and Mississippi.   Almost three in five voters, 57 percent, picked the Democratic Party as more likely to protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, as compared to 35 percent who said they chose Republicans to handle it. Overwhelmingly, those concerned with health care voted Democrat over Republican, 75-23 percent. This article has been updated from the preliminary exit poll results to numbers from the full exit poll results.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brian-kemp-declares-victory-in-hard-fought-georgia-governors-race-but-stacey-abrams-hasnt-conceded---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Greg Bluesmen provides insight into the gubernatorial race. Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp claimed victory Wednesday in his gubernatorial contest with Democrat Stacey Abrams -- but Abrams, vying to become the nation's first black female governor, is so far refusing to concede. Fox News has not yet called the race. According to Associated Press vote totals with all precincts reporting, Kemp has 1,972,952 votes to Abrams' 1,909,730 -- giving him 50.3 percent to her 48.7 percent. The state could have had its first-ever gubernatorial runoff if neither candidate had cleared the 50 percent mark. "Brian Kemp earned nearly two million votes on Tuesday - by far the most of any gubernatorial candidate in our state's history," Kemp press secretary Cody Hall said in a statement. Hall continued: "Absentee ballots are counted and Kemp leads his opponent by 64,000 votes. Based on counts released by the Secretary of State's office, Brian Kemp's margin is so large that the number of provisional ballots and overseas ballots will not change his Election Day victory. Simply put, it is mathematically impossible for Stacey Abrams to win or force a run-off election." Kemp had previously faced criticism for refusing to announce preemptively that he would recuse himself from overseeing any recount that may have occurred in the race. "Peach State voters made a clear decision at the ballot box." "Peach State voters made a clear decision at the ballot box," Hall said. "Brian Kemp will now begin his transition as governor-elect of Georgia. He will work every day to keep our state moving in the right direction." But early Wednesday, Abrams signaled she's ready for a fight. "Democracy only works when we work for it, when we fight for it, when we demand it, and apparently today when we stand in line for hours to meet it at the ballot box," Abrams told supporters. "I am here today to tell you there are votes remaining to be counted. Voices are waiting to be heard." Her campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, added: "We have three factors to be considered here: outstanding votes, absentee ballots to be counted, and provisional ballots. Given those three issues, we believe this is likely heading to a runoff." The Georgia race was among the most closely watched gubernatorial contests nationally. Democrats seized several state governorships from Republicans on Tuesday night, but fell short in Iowa, Ohio, and Florida -- three states former President Obama won in 2012 but that President Trump carried in 2016. Control of the nation's governor's mansions is expected to be particularly important in 2020, when states draw their new congressional district lines, which can be vetoed by the chief executives. The Georgia contest was marked with drama and intrigue long before the final votes were cast. Kemp announced on Sunday his office was investigating "possible cyber crimes" by the Georgia Democratic Party, throwing a last-minute wrench into what was already a tight race. Abrams and the state Democratic party swiftly rejected the allegations, claiming there was "never a hack" and declaring it was a feeble attempt to "suppress the vote." GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR POSSIBLE CYBER CRIMES, KEMP SAYS Abrams was hoping to make history Tuesday night, as well as break a decades-old red streak of gubernatorial victories in the Peach State. The state hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1998. However, Abrams previously emphasized she didn't want people to support her based solely on those reasons. “I don’t want anyone to vote for me because I’m black. And no one on the ballot needs a vote because we’re women. And I don’t even want you to vote for us just because we’re Democrats. You need to vote for us because we’re better," she told a crowd in Savannah Monday. Both candidates are being backed by big-name celebrities and political heavyweights: Kemp boasted the support of Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker, President Trump and Vice President Pence, while Abrams claimed Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama among her supporters. "Make history here in Georgia. Make things better here in Georgia," Obama urged a crowd of voters last week while endorsing Abrams at Morehouse College in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Trump stumped for Kemp, whom he described as an "incredible fighter and tireless champion for the people." "Stacey Abrams is one of the most extreme, far-left politicians in the entire country... You put Stacey in there, and you're gonna have Georgia turn into Venezuela. I don't think the people of Georgia like that," Trump said at an event in Macon on Sunday. Fox News' Jennifer Earl and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/veterans-still-outpace-civilians-congress-declines-continue---split---Jason Crow, Democratic candidate for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District won his election Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file) The number of military veterans in both chambers of Congress will at best remain unchanged despite a midterm cycle featuring dozens of candidates with military experience on both sides of the aisle. Seventy-four veterans won House seats Tuesday night. Eight others were locked in races still too close to call Wednesday afternoon. In the Senate, a projected win for retired Air Force office Martha McSally in an Arizona race would bring the number of veterans in the next Congress to 17 — the same number that finished the 115th Congress. Even if veterans win all the outstanding races in the House, the percentage of House lawmakers with military experience will remain unchanged: 19 percent. That’s a disappointing performance for veterans’ advocates who had hoped to see an end to nearly 50 years of decline for veteran representation in Congress. However, the number of female veterans, Democrats with military experience and younger veterans with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan will rise. But the percentage of veterans in Congress is still higher than the greater population, just 8 percent even after almost two decades of war. Veterans offered an antidote to divisive politics and a deadlocked Congresses in campaign commercials that highlighted their combat experience as evidence they could work across party lines and get things done in times of conflict. Such characterizations are not supported by data, said Lindsey Cormack, a political scientist and author of “Congress and U.S. Veterans: From the GI Bill to the VA Crisis.” “There is no evidence that once they get to Congress, veterans are more bipartisan than anyone else,” she said. Rather, she attributed the large number of veterans on the ballot Tuesday to “smart politicking.” “A lot more people are asking vets to run,” she said. The reason, she added, is simple: “When you look at public opinion polls, people don’t trust politicians, lawyers, scientists but they do trust veterans,” she said. Advocacy groups said veterans were well positioned to appeal to voters on a wide range of issues and gain the trust of voters who consistently rank military officers among the most honest and ethical professionals. Dan Caldwell, Executive Director of Concerned Veterans for America, said veterans from both parties campaigned on policy issues important to their constituents instead of expecting to stand out solely based on their military experience, a mistake candidates made in previous cycles. “They had more developed and well-thought-out policy platforms,” he said. CVA, is a non-profit in the Koch brothers’ political network and a vocal critic of the Veterans Affairs administration. Josh Soltz, chairman of VoteVets, which supports Democratic veterans running in Congress, said veterans were uniquely positioned. “This cycle is about winning in red America, and winning in districts that Democrats used to have.” he said. “This election is defined on Donald Trump, whether you are with him or against him or whether you want to stop his agenda. I think veterans will play a real role in stopping what he wants to do.” He pointed to candidates such as Democrat Jason Crow, who defeated incumbent Mike Coffman in Colorado’s 6th District. Democrats targeted Coffman for several cycles. But Crow, a first-time candidate, was able to appeal to women in red parts of the district, which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and tie Coffman to Trump at every turn. Another example, he said, is Mikie Sherrill, a Navy veteran and former prosecutor, whose win Tuesday night represents the first time a Democrat will represent New Jersey’s 11th district since 1985. Veterans will bring their personal and military experience to bear on a number of defense-related issues in the 116th Congress, including potential budget cuts at the Pentagon, the fallout from President Trump’s decision to deploy the national guard — a cost of $200- to $300 million — to stop a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border, and debate over the Trump administration’s attempts to restrict transgender and immigrant service in the military. Danielle Lupton, a Colgate University political science professor who has studied veterans in the House, said military experience tends to influence lawmakers’ votes on certain issues. When there are more veterans in Congress, she said, lawmakers are less likely to support the use of military force abroad. Veterans in Congress are also more likely to exert oversight over the president’s use of power in foreign policy than non-veterans, she said. “It doesn’t matter if the president is of their party or not,” she said. “They will still increase oversight of war operations and try to put checks on presidential power.” The new class of veterans also reflects the broader success of Democrats on the midterm ballot with 23 wins. (Five more await results in contests not called by publication time.) That comes after a period of decline in Democratic representation among veterans. During the Obama era, veterans were divided about evenly between Democrats and Republicans. But in the last Congress, about 80 percent of Congressional veterans were Republicans, Cormack said. At least four female veterans have won their races, bringing the total number of women with military experience to ever serve in Congress to eight. The number of lawmakers with military experience peaked at 75 percent in the House in 1967 and at 81 percent in the Senate in 1975, after conscription pushed larger percentages of the American into military service, according to the Pew Research Center. At the end of the 115th Congress, there were 77 veterans in the House and 17 in the Senate, according to data compiled by CQ. Air Force veteran Denver Riggleman, a Republican who will replace Rep. Tom Garrett in Virginia’s 5th District, agreed that foreign policy is an area where he and his veteran colleagues “will probably shine.” “There’s an operational experience element to this,” Riggleman said. “There’s a sobriety that comes to that, that when you put people in harm’s way, there better be a darn good reason — because you’ve been there yourself.” More than 170 veterans appeared on midterm ballots Tuesday, with years of service dating back to the 1950s. The candidates represented both parties: Sixty-two Democrats, 109 Republicans and one independent. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

In 2007, 11% of Muslims identified as Republican. The share changed very little in surveys conducted by the Center in 2011 (11%) and 2017 (13%). Sizable shares of both Republican and Democratic Muslims are critical of the way both parties treat U.S. Muslims. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans (57%) and about half of Democrats (47%) say neither party is friendly toward Muslims in America. This criticism may be one reason a relatively large share of Muslims neither identify with nor lean toward either party. Indeed, U.S. Muslims are twice as likely as the public overall to say they lean toward neither major political party (20% vs. 9%). In some ways, U.S. Muslims who identify as Republicans are demographically similar to Muslims who are Democrats. For instance, similar shares in both groups are under age 40 (58% vs. 60%) and are immigrants (52% vs. 57%). There are some demographic differences, however. U.S.-born blacks make up a smaller share of Muslim Republicans than Democrats (6% vs. 15%). Republican Muslims are somewhat less likely than their Democratic counterparts to have graduated from college (22% vs. 36%). There also are some differences in their views of important issues, including immigration. Muslim Republicans are much more likely than Muslim Democrats (45% vs. 11%) to say immigrants are a burden to society because they take jobs, housing and healthcare, according to a survey conducted by the Center between January and May 2017. There also is partisan divide on this issue among those in the public overall, according to a separate survey conducted in June and July 2017. Republican Muslims in general are also more likely than Democrats (50% vs. 23%) to say they prefer a smaller government with fewer services. But the partisan divide on this issue among Muslims is narrower than it is among the overall public. On other questions, such as views of homosexuality, or on measures of household income and religious commitment, the Center did not have an adequate sample of Muslim Republicans to measure partisan differences. As might be expected, Republican Muslims are less likely than Democrats to see the Republican Party generally, and President Trump specifically, as unfriendly toward Muslim Americans. Still, sizable shares see their own party – and Trump – as unfriendly. In the 2017 survey, around half of GOP Muslims (52%) said Trump is unfriendly toward U.S. Muslims and about a third (34%) said the same about the GOP in general.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-returns_us_5be31fd6e4b0dbe871a5fc37---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he doesn’t want to let Democrats see his tax returns once they assume control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year. But that’s actually not up to the president ― according to the law, at least. The leaders of key congressional committees can ask the IRS for anybody’s tax returns. Republicans simply did not want to do so. Democrats said in October that they would ask the IRS for Trump’s returns if they regained control of the House, which they did on Tuesday night. Trump said Wednesday that he would hand over his tax returns if he weren’t being audited ― an excuse he has made since his 2016 campaign, even though nothing about an IRS audit prevents a candidate or a president from disclosing his returns. “If I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it,” he said Wednesday in a rambling answer to a reporter’s question. Federal law gives congressional tax committees the power to obtain anyone’s tax returns. If the taxpayer doesn’t consent in writing, the committees still have the power to obtain the returns in a secret meeting. In response to a written request, the law says, “the Secretary [of the Treasury] shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request.” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would review any such request with department lawyers “for legality,” according to a spokesperson. “I don’t think there’s any reasonable basis to resist,” said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center. But, he added, “there’s no telling what this president will do, whether he’ll flout the law.” Trump was the first major-party presidential candidate in 40 years not to release his tax returns, which can reveal detailed information about a person’s sources of income, charitable giving and the amount of taxes paid.

Press secretary Sarah Sanders says a reporter's access was removed because he put "his hands on a young woman". Mr Acosta, chief White House correspondent for CNN, was called a "rude, terrible person" by Mr Trump at a press conference on Wednesday. A staff member tried to take his microphone during the exchange. However, Mr Acosta refused to give it up as he attempted to ask the president a further question. Video of the incident quickly appeared online. Ms Sanders, in a statement posted in a Twitter thread, said the White House would "never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job". "The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it's an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration," she said. "As a result of today's incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice." Mr Acosta called Ms Sanders' assertion that he placed his hands on the woman "a lie". He also posted a tweet saying he was stopped by the Secret Service from entering White House grounds. I’ve just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit End of Twitter post by @Acosta President Trump insulted Mr Acosta after the reporter challenged his recent assertions about a migrant caravan heading to the US from Central America. It was during this exchange the female staff member attempted to take the microphone from Mr Acosta. "That's enough, that's enough," the president said, before telling Mr Acosta to sit down and to put down his microphone. "CNN should be ashamed of themselves, having you work for them," he said. "The way you treat Sarah Huckabee [Sanders] is horrible." Mr Trump had publicly humiliated the top law official over the Russia probe dogging his presidency. 15 sayings from around the world

Among the expenditures by "America's Mayor" were $12,012 on cigars and $7,131 on fountain pens over a five-month period, Judith Giuliani's lawyer, Bernard Clair, told Justice Michael Katz, according to NBC New York affiliate WNBC. In that same time frame, Giuliani, 74, also spent over $286,000 on his alleged mistress, $447,938 "for his own enjoyment" and $165,000 on travel for himself, Clair said. But since his wife filed for divorce earlier this year, Giuliani has claimed his income has dried up, Clair said, mockingly referring to the problem as "sudden income deficit syndrome." That's "financial trouble that existed only post-commencement" of the divorce, he told the judge. "His actions and his finances and his expenses don't comport with the claim of his income diminishment," Clair added, noting that Giuliani reported making $9.5 million last year. Giuliani and his lawyer say he is representing Trump for free, and the court proceeding revealed what he has given up to take on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation: from $4 million to $6 million from his former law firm, Greenberg Traurig, which he left in May. Katz asked Giuliani why he would represent Trump for nothing, given that the president's other lawyers in the Russia probe are getting paid. Giuliani's lawyer, Faith Miller, said he was doing so because of "a 30-year relationship with Mr. Trump." Miller maintained her client has been generous in supporting his wife, the former Judith Nathan, since their split, paying about $1 million in expenses. And, Miller noted, Giuliani has been working three jobs and is still making millions while the "much younger" Judith Giuliani, 63, "chooses not to" work. While Giuliani's alleged fountain pen spending was a surprise, his fondness for cigars is well known. He once graced the cover of Cigar Aficionado magazine, which last year hailed him as "a stalwart defender of cigar rights." He's also a regular at the Grand Havana Club, an exclusive cigar smoking club in New York City, where membership costs over $7,500 a year. Giuliani had an ugly and very public divorce from his second wife, Donna Hanover, during his second term as mayor. The case was settled in 2002, with Giuliani agreeing to pay Hanover over $6.8 million. John Chandler is a reporter for NBC New York. Dareh Gregorian writes for NBC News. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-take-control-of-the-house-with-victories-in-the-suburbs---split---Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeated GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo in Florida's 26th District.(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Democrats are poised to take over the House after notching key victories in the suburbs. NBC, ABC News and CNN projected Democrats would take control of the chamber even as the outcome in number of competitive races remains unclear. But early Democratic victories signaled a tough night for Republicans, especially in the 25 GOP-held districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. The developments mark the first time since 2011 that Democrats control the House. A Democratic majority increases the likelihood that President Donald Trump’s administration and federal agencies will face increased scrutiny and sets the stage for even more congressional gridlock with the Senate still in Republican hands. The biggest upset of the night so far has come in Oklahoma's 5th District, where non-profit director Kendra Horn defeated GOP Rep. Steve Russell in a district Trump won by nearly 14 points. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales had rated the race Solid Republican. The race wasn't on anyone's radar -- Russell hadn't indicated to the National Republican Congressional Committee that he was in trouble. But Horn had raised more than $1 million and was endorsed by Democratic groups including End Citizens United and EMILY's List. Democratic energy, fueled by opposition to Trump in these largely suburban districts took down incumbents often touted as among the most formidable in the GOP conference, including Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, and Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock. Some GOP incumbents in Clinton districts have prevailed, including Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in the Philadelphia suburbs and New York Rep. John Katko, whose district includes Syracuse. Watch: ‘Pretty Stoked to be Voting’— Voters Around the Beltway Share Their Election-Day Thoughts As expected, redistricting in Pennsylvania proved to be a boon for Democrats, who so far have had a net gain of three seats in the Keystone State. The new congressional map shifted several districts in Democrats’ direction. It remains to be seen how large a Democratic majority could be in the House, since they have not been as successful in the more Republican leaning districts. Democrats failed to pick up some tougher GOP-held seats in Florida, Texas and Kentucky. Two Democratic women veterans with viral web videos -- MJ Hegar in Texas Amy McGrath in Kentucky -- lost their races in traditionally Republican districts. Democrats have had mixed success in districts that backed former President Barack Obama and flipped to backing Trump. So far Democrats have won two such races in Iowa, defeating GOP Reps. Rod Blum and David Young. In Minnesota, Democrat Angie Craig defeated GOP Rep. Jason Lewis in a rematch from 2016. Army veteran Max Rose also notched a win for Democrats in a race Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rated Lean Republican, defeating New York GOP Rep. Dan Donovan in the Staten Island-based district.

---split---4.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/setback-pompeos-north-korea-meetings-called-off-explanation/story?id=59028494---split---A Thursday meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart in New York has been abruptly called off without explanation in another setback for the Trump administration's nuclear negotiations. The cancellation comes amid North Korean threats to restart its nuclear development unless the U.S. begins to remove sanctions -- a step the administration says it will not take until North Korea meaningfully moves to denuclearize, which it so far has not done. The meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, the former spy chief and now top nuclear negotiator, "will now take place at a later date ... when our respective schedules permit," the U.S. side said just after midnight on Wednesday, hours before Pompeo was supposed to travel to New York. It did not specify why the meetings were postponed or at which side's request.   But it comes amid renewed doubts about the Trump administration's efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief. That effort has stalled, with North Korea refusing to declare the details of its nuclear capabilities or, so far, allow international inspectors into the country to verify claims that is has dismantled certain sites. The State Department had been touting an agreement signed by Pompeo during the last U.S.-North Korean meetings in Pyongyang in early October. Then, North Korea agreed to allow inspectors to visit its missile engine test site and nuclear test site. Pompeo said on October 8 that those inspectors would visit North Korea "as soon as we get it logistically worked out." They still have not visited. Instead of following through on that, in recent days North Korea has been criticizing the U.S. over its sanctions, threatening last Friday to bring back its "byongjin" policy -- advancing its nuclear arsenal and economic development at the same time. On Sunday, Pompeo dismissed that as posturing ahead of negotiations this week. The statement did not threaten to end nuclear negotiations, however, and the North Koreans are said to still be pursuing a second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. One of the main goals of this week's planned meeting was to ensure that the summit was productive, according to Pompeo, by preparing some agreements for the two leaders to sign.   After the cancellation, South Korea tried to quell concerns Wednesday, with presidential spokesperson Kim Eui-kyeom telling reporters, "We don't believe that the delay means the North Korea-U.S. summit won't happen or momentum for the summit has been lost," according to Reuters. But the growing divide between the U.S. and South Korea also has many concerned, as liberal President Moon Jae-in pushes for closer Korean ties including demilitarizing the border and increasing economic cooperation. That has put him at odds at times with the Trump administration, including when requesting sanctions exemptions for joint economic projects with the North. Pompeo was reportedly incensed in September at a military agreement between the two Korea's, with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha saying Pompeo called her twice in one day to express his displeasure because he felt he had not been adequately briefed. To that end, the U.S. and South Korea announced last week the creation of a new working group to "strengthen our close coordination," including on "sanctions implementation and inter-Korean cooperation that comply with the United Nations sanctions," according to State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino.

USA TODAY The day after the midterm elections, President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday. In a resignation letter sent to the president, Sessions noted that he was asked to resign but thanked Trump "for the opportunity" to be attorney general. He also listed what he considered his accomplishments during his tenure. Read the letter below. Dear Mr. President, At your request, I am submitting my resignation. Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country. I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice. The team we assembled embraced your directive to be a law and order Department of Justice. We prosecuted the largest number of violent offenders and firearm defendants in our country's history. We took transnational gangs that are bringing violence and death across our borders and protected national security. We did our part to restore immigration enforcement. We targeted the opioid epidemic by prosecuting doctors, pharmacists, and anyone else who contributes to this crisis with new law enforcement tools and determination. And we have seen results. After two years of rising violent crime and homicides prior to this administration, those trends have reversed–thanks to the hard work of our prosecutors and law enforcement around the country. I am particularly grateful to the fabulous men and women in law enforcement all over this country with whom I have served. I have had no greater honor than to serve alongside them. As I have said many times, they have my thanks and I will always have their backs. More importantly, in my time as Attorney General we have restored and upheld the rule of law–a glorious tradition that each of us has a responsibility to safeguard. We have operated with integrity and have lawfully and aggressively advanced the policy agenda of this administration. I have been honored to serve as Attorney General and have worked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the Presidency. Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President. Sincerely, Jefferson B. Sessions III Attorney General A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/pelosi-trump-house-speaker.html---split---Supported by By Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Nicholas Fandos WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the highest-ranking House Democrat, declared on Wednesday that she was confident that her newly ascendant colleagues would elect her speaker, as she moved aggressively to hold off a challenge to her leadership that could fracture the party. The day after midterm elections that handed her party control of the House, Ms. Pelosi curtly brushed aside questions about whether she was convinced she would continue to lead her caucus — “Yes, I am,” she said — even as other Democrats jockeyed for position. Republicans, after stinging losses, braced for a leadership battle of their own. The maneuverings were the first signs of potentially bruising battles over the direction of both parties in a new era of divided government, in which Democrats and Republicans will both face internal struggles to define their messages and their tactics. Democrats faced immediate decisions on how aggressively, and where, to use their oversight powers to investigate President Trump and his administration, and how far to go in seeking compromise or confrontation with a commander in chief who has labeled them sworn enemies. Mr. Trump began the day offering Ms. Pelosi an early, if unusual, endorsement on Twitter. In a backhanded compliment to an adversary he relishes attacking, he later said during a formal postelection news conference that he would even supply her with Republican votes to win the speakership if there was not sufficient support among Democrats to elect her. “I think she deserves it,” Mr. Trump said. “She’s fought long and hard, she’s a very capable person, and you know, you have other people shooting at her trying to take over the speakership.” Ms. Pelosi, fresh off midterm election wins that her allies believe have cemented her hold on the top position, said the president was right about her fitness for the job, but for the wrong reasons. “I don’t think anybody deserves anything — it’s not about what you have done, it’s what you can do,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference at the Capitol. “And I think I’m the best person to go forward, to unify, to negotiate.” Still, Democrats do face consequential choices about their leadership as a new, more diverse and younger majority prepares to take over. Ms. Pelosi, 78, has exuded confidence that her colleagues would choose her to resume her tenure as the first female speaker of the House, and whispers that she would face a serious challenge appear to have dissipated. Behind the scenes on Wednesday, she began the process of gathering the votes she needs to hold off any rebellion, making telephone calls to Democratic lawmakers to secure their support, according to a senior Democratic aide. She spent Wednesday night in her Capitol office handwriting personalized messages on letters that went to each Democratic lawmaker and newly elected member, in which she solicited their support “with confidence and humility.” “We must show on the first day of the 116th Congress that we are prepared to get the job done for the American people,” she wrote. Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, who is supporting Ms. Pelosi for speaker, said that “with victory on your side, it always helps a lot.” But he and other more centrist members of the party in the House will insist on changes to ensure they have a voice in legislating and policymaking. Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday that she would put forward new rules that would ensure “openness and transparency” in the way the House runs. “Our newcomers will be part of putting together how our agenda goes forward,” she said. Some of the Democratic candidates most outspoken about opposing her speakership lost on Tuesday, such as Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and Dan McCready in North Carolina. But others won, including Abigail Spanberger in Virginia — who a spokesman said on Wednesday had not changed her position that Ms. Pelosi should not be speaker — and Joe Cunningham in South Carolina. “There is no chance he will vote for Pelosi,” Tyler Jones, Mr. Cunningham’s spokesman, said on Wednesday. “He will keep his promise.” Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday night that he planned to run for majority leader, the No. 2 position in the House, while Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina plans to run for whip, the No. 3 post. That lineup would keep the top three positions of the current septuagenarian triumvirate — with none of the youthful sheen of the incoming class. “It’s a pretty static situation right now,” said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, who leads the moderate New Democrats Coalition. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have said they want one of their own to be considered for any vacancy in the top two positions. But no one has come forward to challenge Ms. Pelosi or Mr. Hoyer. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who is viewed as a rising star, has told lawmakers he is likely to run for Democratic caucus chairman against Representatives Linda T. Sánchez and Barbara Lee, both of California, a contest that could pit two of Democrats’ geographic strongholds against each other. “We have won the majority, and now we must keep the majority,” Mr. Jeffries, 48, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, he added, the Democrats must “avoid an unnecessary family feud about leadership aspirations.” Mr. Clyburn, who is black, said on Tuesday night that he believed Ms. Pelosi would stay in the top position, with Mr. Hoyer second in line, and “hopefully” himself third. He said he expected to see more African-Americans in other leadership positions, arguing that the newer members would accept such a result. “I’ve been campaigning for all of these people — I talk to them all the time,” Mr. Clyburn said. “I don’t have any problem with them.” Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado said on Wednesday that she would challenge Mr. Clyburn, but she is not expected to topple him, particularly given his base of support in the Black Caucus. Ms. DeGette, who has been the chief deputy whip for more than a decade, said in an interview that she did not “intend to have a messy leadership race.” Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the triumphant chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, announced on Wednesday that he would seek the post of assistant majority leader, the No. 4 job, which is already being pursued by David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Cheri Bustos of Illinois. Republicans were also grappling for power. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the founder of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, announced that he would seek the post of minority leader, pitting him against Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the current No. 2 Republican. In an interview with The Hill on Wednesday, Mr. Jordan placed the blame for Republican losses in the House at the feet of the leaders, suggesting they had not been conservative enough or sufficiently willing to bulldoze Democratic opposition to muscle through Mr. Trump’s top priorities such as repealing the Affordable Care Act, building a huge border wall or cutting welfare. He spent Wednesday dialing fellow Republicans to make his case. Mr. McCarthy defended his tenure, telling House Republicans in a letter that the party had enjoyed “great gains,” including tax cuts and a reduction in federal regulations. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana said he would run for whip, the No. 2 spot, ending speculation that he might challenge Mr. McCarthy. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming announced she would seek the job of Republican conference chairwoman, setting up a likely showdown with the current chairwoman, Representative Cathy McMorris-Rodgers of Washington. The maneuvering among top Democrats was quieter. Mr. Hoyer has begun collecting signatures from allies for a letter highlighting his experience, his ability to take on Mr. Trump, and the steps he has taken to advance younger members on his whip team, according to two Democrats familiar with the effort. As of Wednesday, several lawmakers said they did not expect a serious head-to-head challenge against Ms. Pelosi to emerge, but it was still far from certain whether she would have the 218 votes needed to win the speakership. A shrewd vote-counter, Ms. Pelosi would be unlikely to let such a fight play out in the House chamber without being certain that she would win; if she determined that she could not, several lawmakers said they expected a scramble to replace her. Still, allies and adversaries alike noted that a newly empowered Ms. Pelosi had a formidable arsenal of potential sweeteners to offer rank-and-file members who might not be inclined to support her, including prime office space, positions on plum committees and money for staff members — all valuable currency on Capitol Hill.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/sessions-resignation-mueller.html---split---Supported by Congress and the public must now push for protections for the special counsel. By Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen Mr. Wertheimer is the president of Democracy21. Norman Eisen is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Despite the extraordinary success of the special counsel, Robert Mueller — or more likely because of it — he faces his most serious threat yet: the forced resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Early last year, Mr. Sessions, as a former Trump campaign official, recused himself from the Russia investigation, handing over its oversight to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. As acting attorney general in that capacity, Mr. Rosenstein has overseen and vigorously defended the investigation, led by Mr. Mueller. After requesting and receiving Mr. Sessions’s resignation on Wednesday, President Trump wasted no time in naming Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff, as acting attorney general, and shifted the oversight role from Mr. Rosenstein back to the attorney general’s office and its new acting head. As ethics experts, we believe Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from the investigation. If we have ever seen an appearance of impropriety in our decades of experience, this is it: a criminal subject president appointing his own prosecutor — one who has evidently prejudged aspects of the investigation and mused about how it can be hampered. No prosecutor — or indeed governmental official of any kind — should work on a matter under these circumstances. Mr. Whitaker must step aside. His conflicts are just as worrisome in their own way as Mr. Sessions’s conflict was, maybe more so. Whether or not Mr. Whitaker steps aside, Mr. Trump’s audacity now demands additional safeguards. Congress must quickly put in place a plan to protect the Russia investigation before President Trump makes any further efforts to control the special counsel’s office. Our proposed solution is based upon one devised by, of all people, Robert Bork when he was the acting attorney general during Watergate. Mr. Whitaker or whoever becomes the next acting attorney general must provide the same protections against interference that Mr. Bork provided to the special Watergate prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, in a 1973 Justice Department order. Mr. Jaworski received the protections as part of agreeing to replace the previous prosecutor, Archibald Cox, who was fired in the infamous Saturday Night Massacre. The Bork order contained much stronger provisions to protect the independence of the special prosecutor investigation than is now found in the Department of Justice guidelines that govern the Mueller inquiry. These enhanced protections should be demanded from any new person given responsibility to oversee the Mueller investigation: ● The attorney general, acting or permanent, will not remove the special counsel except for extraordinary improprieties. ● The special counsel shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any Justice Department official. The attorney general shall not countermand or interfere with the special counsel’s decisions or actions. ● The attorney general will not limit the jurisdiction of the special counsel without first consulting with the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate. ● The investigation by the special counsel shall continue until he determines that it and all prosecutions and other proceedings within his jurisdiction have been completed or, in his discretion, have been reassigned in the Justice Department. ● The special counsel may from time to time make public such statements or reports as he deems appropriate and shall upon completion of his assignment submit a final report to the appropriate people or entities of Congress and may make such a report public. This is all common sense, but the problem is that it also runs counter to the president’s stated reasons for getting rid of Mr. Sessions — namely, that Mr. Sessions wouldn’t intervene in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. So why would anyone designated as acting attorney general by Mr. Trump, let alone the president himself, go along with such an order? Congress has an important role to play in answering that question. Members of both chambers should demand, including in oversight or other hearings, a commitment, given under oath, from any new person overseeing the Mueller investigation to protect the investigation along the lines of the Bork protections. Legislation also should be pursued to impose the Bork protections on the Mueller investigation. (Alternatively, existing bipartisan legislation to protect the investigation should be renewed.) Senate Republicans might not follow through, but congressional Democrats, new to the majority come January, should make it clear now that any interference with the Mueller inquiry will be met with increasingly aggressive congressional investigations. And the public has a role to play as well. Americans must make it clear that any attack on the special counsel’s office is an attack on the fundamental principles of the rule of law. A number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress have spoken out about the importance of allowing Mr. Mueller to complete his work without interference, and the Bork solution is the logical means to that end. These members need to move into immediate action. For example, in March, Senator Lindsey Graham made an unequivocal public commitment, stating, “I pledge to the American people, as a Republican, to make sure that Mr. Mueller can continue to do his job without any interference.” Senator Graham is in line to lead the Senate Judiciary Committee next year, and this puts him in a powerful position to carry out his pledge to the nation. This is not about partisanship. The strong protections against interference in the Watergate investigation were given by an acting attorney general, a Republican, to protect the independence of a special prosecutor investigating a Republican president. Nearly 50 years later, the American people should ask no less.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be traveling to New York on Thursday to meet with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol. Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced the end of the U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, as the administration restored a network of sanctions on the regime. Rich Edson explains on 'Special Report.' As the full slate of US-imposed sanctions on Iran kicks back into effect on Monday – as a consequence of the Trump administration pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in May – civil unrest is expected to only deepen across the economically embattled nation. But from the vantage point of several Iranian women long opposed to the reigning religious regime, such unrest and protest is the only way to bring about change; even if it means life on the run as a labeled “terrorist.” Trump administration targets banking and shipping sectors; Rich Edson reports from the State Department. President Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday that members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen's civil war "didn't know how to use" an American-made bomb when they blew up a school bus this past August, killing dozens of children. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended the White House’s move last week to reimpose sanctions against Iran amid criticism from some conservatives that the action does not go far enough to cripple the country’s economy. The Trump administration announces the remaining sanctions that were lifted as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal will be re-imposed on Monday; insight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A U.S. service member has been killed and another wounded in an apparent insider attack in Kabul Saturday. Secretary of State Pompeo says the administration is targeting the core of the regime's economy as it essentially ends participation in the Iran nuclear deal. Rich Edson explains for 'Special Report.' Brazilian right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said Thursday that he will move Brazil’s embassy is Israel to Jerusalem -- following a similar move by President Donald Trump last year.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/dccc-credits-large-battlefield-in-securing-majority---split---DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján touted the committee's efforts in winning back the House. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Democrats won back the House largely due to victories in the suburbs, but they also said their expansive target list led to gains in unlikely places. Voters in suburban districts tend to be wealthier and better educated, and largely backed Democrats on Tuesday — even in districts with strong GOP incumbents. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee executive director Dan Sena said there is a case to be made following Tuesday’s results that suburban areas are becoming permanent fixtures of the Democratic electorate. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly) Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 But, he noted, Democrats didn’t just win in the suburbs. “When you have local candidates who have the resources to tell their stories... Democrats can actually win anywhere,” Sena said. “... If you have the right type of candidate that fits the district with the right type of resources you can push back on a challenging environment.” Democrats sought to create multiple paths to the majority, Sena said on a press call with reporters Wednesday. They focused on suburban districts, where President Donald Trump remained unpopular, as well in some of the deeper red districts. The committee had invested at least $100,000 in roughly 85 seats— more than double the number of races the committee invested in last cycle, where Democrats only picked up six seats. DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján noted that in 2016 Trump won 18 of the seats that Democrats flipped Tuesday night. Lujan also said the early investment in field programs helped Democrats, particularly in tougher districts, withstand Republican attacks. Both Luján and Sena acknowledged that they did make significant gains in suburban districts where opposition to Trump was a factor. But Sena said from the beginning of the cycle the committee had to build a strategy to win regardless of the president’s actions. “One of the key pieces that we have learned over the last two years of watching Trump and studying Trump is there is an opposite and equal reaction across the country whenever he does something. We call it shaking the snow globe,” Sena said. “There was an opposite reaction in highly suburban areas. We were there to maximize on it.” So far Democrats have a 26-seat majority in the House. More than 20 have yet to be called, and the DCCC is dispatching staffers and legal teams to districts that are too close to call or where ballots are still being counted. "I’m confident that the Democratic majority will grow,” Luján said.  Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Acosta also tweeted that he had been denied entrance to the White House, where he was scheduled to film a spot for CNN, a network Trump has repeatedly targeted as “fake news.” I’ve just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit He also shared video of the incident. The US Secret Service just asked for my credential to enter the WH. As I told the officer, I don’t blame him. I know he’s just doing his job. (Sorry this video is not rightside up) pic.twitter.com/juQeuj3B9R CNN addressed the decision Wednesday, calling it an “unprecedented decision” based on “lies.” The news outlet said Acosta had the network’s full support. “It was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today’s press conference,” CNN communications said in a statement posted to Twitter. “In an explanation, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lied. She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened.” “This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better,” the company continued. At the White House news conference Wednesday, Trump called Acosta a “rude, terrible person” when he refused to sit down after asking the president about a racist anti-immigration ad his re-election campaign had paid for and promoted ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. Acosta refused to give up the microphone when a White House intern tried to grab it from him, infuriating Trump. “I’ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them ... You shouldn’t be working for CNN,” Trump said to Acosta. In a series of statements on Twitter, Sanders characterized Acosta’s actions as “placing his hands on a young woman,” though video of the exchange shows Acosta turning away from her as the intern reaches over his arm to take the microphone from his hand. “This is a lie,” Acosta tweeted back at Sanders. Reporters quickly began defending Acosta and denounced the accusation Sanders lodged at him. Please watch this. @Acosta did not grab or put his hands on this young lady. https://t.co/u3BaluYL3H This is wrong and deeply concerning. https://t.co/8fAE2eC9Uc Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---5.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nancy-pelosi-poised-return-house-speaker-n931721---split---WASHINGTON — Republicans spent plenty of time over the past election year warning their voters that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would return to the national stage as House speaker if they didn't stop her party from taking control of Congress. Some Democratic candidates running in highly competitive districts even pledged not to support her. And at times over the past year, her own colleagues have agitated against her return to power. Despite all that, Pelosi, the longtime California congresswoman who made history in 2007 by becoming the first woman to hold the House gavel, is poised to become speaker again after a midterm election that swept Democrats back into the majority. Pelosi has been speaking privately with members, including those just elected, attempting to shore up her support and making the case that she is the best person to move the party forward. Some supporters say her experience is needed to maneuver a party that must confront President Donald Trump and an enhanced Republican Senate majority. While she there is a cohort in the party who doesn't want her to take the reins, no other Democrat has emerged as a credible threat to Pelosi's leadership. When asked by reporters on Wednesday whether she is confident of being elected Speaker, Pelosi said, "yes I am." “I don't think anyone deserves anything. It's not about what you have done, it's about what you can do,” she said. “What you have done in the past speaks to your credentials,” she added, “and I think I'm the best person to go forward to unify, to negotiate.” “I think my case is about being the best person for how we go forward.” Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who has been one of her most vocal critics, doesn't want to run for the position, according to his spokesman Matt Corridoni. And Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who ran against Pelosi in the last Congress, getting 63 votes compared to Pelosi's 134, has not stepped forward to launch another challenge. But her detractors say her path is narrow. She needs a majority of voting members, both Republican and Democrat, on the House floor to vote for her. If all Republicans vote against her, she can only afford to lose about a dozen Democrats, depending on how many seats Democrats end up winning after all the races are totaled. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, is expected to remain in his position, too. "I'll certainly be running for majority leader," not speaker, Hoyer told reporters, officially announcing his intention on Wednesday. The party's third-ranking member, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, plans to run for that spot again, telling reporters that he is sending a letter on Wednesday to his colleagues asking for their support. Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn all say that they will be transitional figures, preparing the next generation of leaders. Whether that means Pelosi will pledge to serve just one term is unclear. Democrats' dissatisfaction with Pelosi reached a boiling point in the last Congress when a new generation of members, many of whom had only served in the minority, grew frustrated with a lack of upward mobility and a leadership structure where the top two members — Pelosi and Hoyer — had served in those positions since 2002. Shortly after the House outcome became clear on Tuesday, Pelosi was asked what her message is to newly elected Democrats who said they wouldn't vote for her as speaker. "Congratulations on winning," she said. Pelosi got a boost of support from an unlikely source on Wednesday — President Trump, who said, perhaps because she's an easy target for Republicans, the Democrat deserved the speakership. "In all fairness," Trump Tweeted, "Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!" In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor! Republicans, who will be in the minority come January, are facing a leadership shuffle, too. Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is retiring, and his second in command, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, is running for minority leader. But one of the most conservative members of the House, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is an aggressive defender of the president, has launched his bid for leader as well. And there's already jockeying for other GOP leadership posts. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming announced her intention to run for House GOP conference chair. But while Pelosi's path back to power appears clear, House Democrats face a challenging atmosphere for the next two years. For the first time in his presidency, Trump will be forced to deal with congressional Democrats who now have the power to stop his agenda, promote their own and launch a myriad of investigations into his administration. An increased Senate majority and the president's veto pen will all but ensure that Democratic legislative priorities go unfulfilled. And both parties will almost certainly busy themselves gearing up for the presidential election in 2020. While there is historical precedent for divided government to reach common ground and address national problems, the current political environment makes the prospects unlikely, some members say. “I think it’s going to be very tough to govern over the next two years,” retiring Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., told NBC News. Democrats believe the midterm elections were a referendum on Trump and Republican policies, a repudiation of GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, construct a $25 billion border wall and push additional tax cuts for the wealthy. There's little incentive to work together on legislation. The president’s overt appeals to his base, while making him hugely popular among Republicans, has made him deeply unpopular among Democrats and many independents. And Democratic activists are demanding that their congressional leaders do what they can to stop the president in his tracks. “The most immediate priority has to be real oversight and accountability that has been shockingly absent over the last two years,” said Ben Wikler, executive director of the progressive group MoveOn. David McIntosh, a former member of Congress and current head of the conservative Club for Growth, said such activists are "so angry that I don’t see opportunities to work together." Pelosi would be in charge of the most diverse caucus in history with a record number of women being elected to the House on Tuesday, including the first two Native American women and the first Muslim woman. The number of members who represent districts that supported the presidential candidate of the opposite party has also dwindled in the 2018 midterms. But the Congressional Progressive Caucus is likely to have more weight as it is likely to increase its ranks from 78 members, which will pressure Democratic leadership to enact more of its agenda. Shaunna Thomas, executive director of UltraViolet, a progressive feminist activist group, said that the group’s members will immediately put pressure on elected officials. “We really get to work the day after the election to ensure that the people who now have the power will be held accountable to an agenda that will ensure that they are serving their constituents in a way that they deserved to be heard,” Thomas said.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/midterm-elections-2018-misinformation-voting-hoaxes/---split---Election Day is a perfect environment for misinformation to spread, whether it’s through coordinated campaigns or honest error—or a mix of both. The stakes are high, there’s a lot of breaking news, and the US voting system isn’t always the most intuitive. Social media didn’t create misinformation, but as Emily Dreyfuss wrote last week, it can certainly add fuel to the fire. And the 2018 midterms have been, as the kids say, lit. WIRED will update this page throughout Election Day to track the biggest stories, the most common hoaxes, and the likeliest sources of confusion as they emerge online. If you’re looking for ways to follow the election results tonight, Pia Ceres has you covered here. And most important of all, go vote! Late Monday night, Facebook announced it had identified dozens of accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “may be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior” after US law enforcement alerted the company to some online activity they believe might be linked to foreign entities. So far, the company says it has blocked around 30 Facebook accounts, whose associated pages were mostly in French and Russian, and 85 Instagram accounts, which were mostly in English and covered a mix of celebrities and politics. The company says it will investigate further. “Typically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in a post announcing the action. “But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the US, we wanted to let people know about the action we’ve taken and the facts as we know them today.” The news comes a little over a week after Facebook took down another coordinated network; that one, which the company said originated in Iran, appeared to follow the playbook Russian trolls perfected during the 2016 election: posing as US citizens to drive engagement around divisive social issues and national events. As of Tuesday morning, the company had not identified any foreign entities connected to the blocked accounts. At 11:30 that evening, Facebook distributed a statement saying it blocked the accounts out of concern that the Russia-based Internet Research Agency was involved, but did not confirm whether that was actually the case. Additionally, Gleicher said, "a website claiming to be associated with the IRA published a list of Instagram accounts they claim to have created. We had already blocked most of these accounts yesterday and have now blocked the rest." https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1060027372815159298 There’s no outright deception here, but plenty of room for misunderstanding. On Monday, the CBP announced that it would engage in a “mobile field force demonstration,” showing off its crowd control expertise—in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in El Paso, on Election Day. After civil rights groups expressed concerns that the exercise could double as voter intimidation, the Texas Civil Rights Project confirmed that CBP called it off an hour before the scheduled start time. So if you see reports about the CBP potentially intimidating voters in Texas senate candidate Beto O'Rourke's backyard, know that they’re outdated—but only as of very recently. The race for governor of Georgia, between sitting Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp and Democratic former state representative Stacey Abrams, has become one of the dirtiest contests in the nation. Kemp, who as secretary of state oversees Georgia's voter rolls, has been accused of systematically disenfranchising people, particularly African Americans. Over the weekend, he accused the Democratic Party of hacking without citing evidence. And on Monday, Kemp, who is white, engaged in racial fear-mongering, tweeting that “The Black Panther Party is backing my opponent. RT if you think Abrams is TOO EXTREME for Georgia!” Abrams is African American, as is 30.2 percent of the state, according to the US Census. https://twitter.com/BrianKempGA/status/1059581337554898944 The tweet linked to a Breitbart article, which took an image, posted to Facebook by a group identifying itself as The New Black Panther Party, of a small “armed rally against voter disenfranchisement” held on November 3. The article compares that rally, which appeared to have no more than five Black Panthers in attendance based on a review of 22 photos the group put on Facebook, to the thousand-person-plus rally Trump held for Kemp that same night. Kemp’s supporters are using the same images to claim that Black Panthers are intimidating voters at the polls. One post shared in a Facebook group called Trump Train, which has more than 54,000 members, urged people to call police if they saw Black Panthers at the polls: “Black Panthers, a radicalized-racist militant group, are armed with assult weapons roaming the streets and neighborhoods as well as the voting polls in Georgia to intimidate and 'persuade' Voters to vote for the far-left democrat candidate, Stacey Abrams for Governor.” The New Black Panthers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But it is clear that these images have been taken by Kemp’s supporters out of context—they do not show armed individuals at the polls in Georgia, but rather a small gathering that happened on Saturday on a street corner in Atlanta. Read more about Georgia's race here. Various alarmed citizens are claiming that George Soros owns Smartmatic voting machines, and will use them to tip the election to the favor of Democrats in 16 states. “ALERT: On Election Day if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand request a paper ballot. SOROS owns SmartMatic brand,” a typical entreaty starts. It’s a rumor that has circulated since at least 2012, found oxygen in conservative media in 2016, and is untrue. As Snopes points out, the chairman of UK-based Smartmatic does sit on the board of Soros’s Open Society Foundation, but the connections end there. And even if you still thought Soros was using that loose affiliation to somehow alter votes, the fact is that zero US precincts are using Smartmatic voting machines this year. They didn’t in 2016, either. So if your voting machine is a Smartmatic brand, don’t request a paper ballot. Buy a plane ticket back home to the US, and go to your actual polling place. On Monday, MSNBC erroneously ran a graphic showing results for the Florida gubernatorial race… a day before voting had even begun. The fake tally had Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum leading Republican Ron DeSantis by .6 percentage points, with 99 percent of the votes reported as counted. https://twitter.com/SethMc74/status/1059615391100649473 The network quickly owned up to its mistake. All In host Chris Hayes clarified shortly after that the seemingly prophetic graphic was caused by a system error, which “inadvertently populated some test numbers” on-screen. “Obviously, we do not yet have any vote totals here, the night before the election,” said Hayes. “That was a misfire. Don’t worry. I was pretty confused when I saw it up there, to see it myself.” Regardless, the image is currently circulating on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Voat, and other platforms as “evidence” the election is rigged. “Soros has rigged the election outcome in Florida and MSNBC already got the results,” reads one post on pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald with over 2,800 upvotes. Tweets from far-right commentators like Pamela Geller, Jack Posobiac and Jim Hoft have only further muddied the waters. The same falsehood pops up every election: that non-citizens are voting in vast numbers. This is not, and has never been true, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which looked into the issue after President Trump claimed millions of non-citizens cast illegal votes in the 2016 election and found fewer than 50 cases nationwide. But in 2018, it remains a popular far-right conspiracy theory, playing into fears of illegal immigration. (According to Google Trends, “immigration” has been the second-most searched-for election topic this week.) The misinformation this year has come from elected officials and average Americans alike. President Trump tweeted that he’d told law enforcement to watch out for illegal voting, but ProPublica found that no law enforcement agency would confirm that they'd been contacted about it. Georgia Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp sent out a robocall saying his opponent Stacey Abrams wanted undocumented immigrants to vote. A meme circulating on Facebook urges Republican voters in mostly Democratic California to “Vote Red in California—offset one vote by an illegal alien.” Well-known conservative writer Larry Schweikart falsely claimed that Democratic Senate Candidate Beto O’Rourke is paying “illegals” in Texas to vote for him against incumbent Ted Cruz. https://twitter.com/LarrySchweikart/status/1059848001579929600 Project Veritas' James O'Keefe published a video on Twitter Tuesday that claims to prove widespread illegal voting by non citizens, when what it actually shows is an ill-informed poll worker who appears to not know what DACA or Dreamers are. The poll worker informs the "undercover journalist" in the video that if a person is registered to vote, they can vote—despite the person taking the video telling them that the registered voter in question is a Dreamer. However, if a person is not a citizen, they can't register. The video was later tweeted by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, though he admitted he hadn't verified if it was accurate.

---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-gop-leader-touts-bipartisanship-warns-dems-presidential/story?id=59032014---split---Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with a rare smile and spring in his step, made clear Wednesday that he is happy with the outcome of the election that has increased his majority by at least three senators, calling President Donald Trump's efforts "very helpful" with that victory. “Indeed it is a good morning for Senate Republicans,” the Kentucky Republicans told reporters. But gone was any hint of partisan crowing.     In fact, McConnell called for "bipartisanship" numerous times and even offered some advice for his Democratic counterparts who retook the House majority and have promised multiple oversight investigations of the president, including a quest for his tax returns.   “The whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting,” the leader said, “I remember when we tried it in the late 90s. We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down, and we under-performed in the next election.” "The Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy. I'm not so sure it will work for them,” McConnell added, refusing to directly answer a question about a post-election presidential tweet implying Senate Republicans might just counter-investigate House Democrats for “leaks of Classified Information” in retaliation.  If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!  McConnell eschewed further attempts to get him to respond to heated presidential rhetoric, refusing to call the migrant caravan - still hundreds of miles from the southern U.S. border - a “crisis,” as Trump did in high profile campaign rallies designed to turn out the GOP base. And in a rare moment of practicality, the Republican leader, who is up for re-election in 2020, conceded that one of the GOP’s signature efforts -- the repeal of “Obamacare” -- is all but dead. “I think the message is, figure out what you can do together and do it,” McConnell said, adding that the Affordable Care Act needs to be fixed but that any effort to repair the Obama-era law would have to be done “on a bipartisan basis.” “The rhetoric doesn’t solve the problem,” said McConnell. But old disagreements are not easily fixed, and partisan lines are deeper in a divided country that delivered a divided Congress. When asked where he could specifically find common ground with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, McConnell struggled to name examples - offering only the usual example of infrastructure, something that is often cited but rarely a bipartisan achievement. President Trump also cited this as an area where he could work with Democrats in 2016, but nothing has happened to date.   The GOP leader sounded something of a quiet alarm on funding for the border and that 10 percent middle-class tax cut touted by Trump in the waning days of the 2018 midterms. The former is caught up in what could be a fierce fight over efforts to fund the government after December 7. President Trump wants as much as $5 billion to fund the southern border wall, but senior House Democratic advisers have told ABC News that Democrats, with a newly-reclaimed majority - will be loathe to provide one cent for that kind of funding. And while McConnell said he would “work hard” to realize the President’s priorities on the wall, he would only say any effort to cut middle-class taxes would have to be done “on a bipartisan basis."

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/midterm-election-results-analysis-blue-wave_us_5bde7bd2e4b09d43e31f8e2a---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: BRIGHTON, Mich. ― Doug Vandewarker, a software consultant, said he usually votes Republican. But he was voting Democratic this time because he didn’t think Donald Trump “should be the face of our country.” Over the course of two hours outside a polling place in Brighton, a small Michigan city roughly equidistant between Detroit and Lansing, I heard many more statements similar to that ― like when Mike Blood, managing director at a software company, said he wanted “a bulwark against the current administration,” and when Crystal Straughan, a hairdresser, said, “I don’t think the president is a good example for my child.” All of these people said they’d voted for Republicans at points in the past, as did Mary Ann Budd, a horticulturalist. But on Tuesday, she said, “I voted Democratic all the way through and I haven’t done that in years. I’m independent, leaning conservative. There needs to be more balance.” It was a lot different from what I’d heard two years ago outside another Michigan polling place ― in Macomb County, the heavily white, middle-class Detroit suburb where the most energized voters were the ones who hated Hillary Clinton. The angry mood was a hint of things to come that night. I’d picked Brighton for this year’s stakeout in the hopes it would be similarly revealing. The city sits in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District, which Trump carried by 7 percentage points and Mike Bishop, the Republican incumbent, won by even more in 2016. But this time Bishop was running against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer who had served in Iraq. Her big issue was Bishop’s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its highly popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The argument over health care ― along with a devastating television ad ― may have made the difference. Slotkin won, with the Wednesday morning tally showing her vote share at 50.8 percent to Bishop’s 46.8 percent, for a margin of roughly 13,000 votes. Slotkin’s victory was part of a bigger trend, one that was arguably Tuesday’s most important result: Democrats winning back the House of Representatives. As of Wednesday morning, Democrats seemed poised to claim about 230 seats overall, giving them a 25-seat majority, give or take ― more than enough to stop Republican legislation and, no less important, to start Democratic investigations. The push to repeal Obamacare by legislation will stop, at least for now. The Trump administration’s management of government, not to mention Trump’s personal and financial conduct, will finally get some congressional scrutiny. Democrats made other major gains ― like the election of America’s first openly gay governor in Colorado and the passage of ballot initiatives in three deeply conservative states that will allow 300,000 low-income working adults to get Medicaid. Two years ago, in the wake of Trump’s election, shell-shocked Democrats probably would have cherished such victories. But the mood among Democrats and their supporters was pretty mixed as Tuesday slipped into Wednesday. Partly the disappointment was a function of losses by a handful of candidates, like Beto O’Rourke, the Texas congressman running for the Senate, in whom Democrats across the country had invested so much emotionally. Partly it was how the night played out: The first big news came from Florida, where progressives watched one of their heroes, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, lose his bid to become governor ― even as they saw one of their villains, outgoing governor Rick Scott, move ahead in the vote for U.S. senator. (A recount is now likely in the Senate race.) But the setbacks went beyond that. Control of the U.S. Senate had also been in play this election and, although the polls had suggested for a while that Republicans were likely to retain their majority, many Democrats grasped at encouraging signs ― like shocking early turnout numbers in Texas or a late-breaking media investigation of the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. In the end, the polls were right and the upset didn’t happen. Republicans will actually emerge from the election with a larger majority in the Senate than they had before, ensuring no media narrative about a “blue wave.” But it would have been that kind of wave if votes actually translated more directly to results. Democrats won the national popular vote by more than 7 percentage points, according to the latest data. It’s no secret why Democrats nevertheless emerged with fewer Senate seats. The Constitution gives disproportionate power to small states in the upper chamber, which in the current political alignment means conservative-leaning states have extra representation. This is an ongoing problem that will undermine Democrats in the next election just as surely as it did this one. A similar problem plagues the House, where the incoming Democratic majority is probably smaller than it might have been because of partisan gerrymandering. And the newly elected Democrats who won in Republican-leaning districts like Michigan’s 8th are sure to face difficult challenges winning re-election in two years. As gerrymandering expert Dave Daley told HuffPost recently, “If it requires a generational wave to give Democrats [the House], that’s a sign of just how powerful gerrymandering is, not a sign that it can be conquered.” In 2020, Democrats will have to confront another familiar obstacle: the Electoral College, which also gives smaller states extra power. It’s why Democrats have won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, with the lone loss a relatively small one, but in three of the six elections a Republican went to the White House anyway. This is the new normal in America, the political minority wielding power that looks more like a majority’s, and the problem seems likely to get worse as Republicans find more and more ways to protect themselves politically. Some of the most arresting images from Tuesday showed the long lines in Georgia, where Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state who was also the party’s nominee for governor, told a private gathering that Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams’ voter mobilization “continues to concern us, especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote.” (Kemp was ahead on Wednesday morning, though Georgia was still counting ballots.) That kind of thing was happening all over in the country. In North Dakota, the location of another key contested Senate race, Republicans had implemented a voter identification law that made it more difficult for Native Americans, also thought to lean Democratic, to cast ballots. Those barriers to voting, like some of the more egregious attempts at partisan gerrymandering, are constitutionally suspect. But Democrats cannot count on federal courts to save them because Republicans are successfully packing the courts with sympathetic judges ― including the U.S. Supreme Court, in no small part because they refused to fill a vacant seat while Barack Obama was still president. Republicans have at least one other big advantage going for them and that is the media: They can depend on a slavishly partisan set of publications and networks upon which their followers will rely exclusively ― an ecosystem that has no real analogue on the political left. In 2018, that meant Republicans could make up stories about invasions from an immigrant caravan or claim falsely to support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The strategy didn’t work everywhere, as Mike Bishop can attest, but it probably helped secure at least some of those Senate races. The midterms were a stress test for the U.S. system of government ― an experiment in whether a party could pursue a highly unpopular agenda and get away with it. The results were mixed at best. Republicans lost their House majority, yes, but they could have lost bigger, and somehow their Senate majority did grow. Ultimately, some less-heralded victories at the state level may prove more consequential in terms of future elections. In Florida, voters approved a constitutional amendment to automatically re-enfranchise felons who had served their time, with exceptions for convicted murderers and sex offenders. That should give the vote to more than a million Floridians, many of whom committed only minor crimes many years before. And in Michigan, two key political reforms passed at the ballot box. One sets up a bipartisan commission to draw lines for state legislative and congressional districts, in the hopes of ending gerrymandering once and for all. The other enacts a series of reforms, including same-day registration, that will make it easier to vote. Both reforms had strong support from the people I met in Brighton, even those who were voting for Republicans. Fairness seems to have at least some bipartisan appeal. But the Michigan and Florida measures remain more the exception than the rule. Gerrymandering will persist in other parts of the country, as will voter suppression, and even moderate changes to the Senate (like adding the District of Columbia as a full-voting state) are not possible right now. All of that means Democrats have to keep doing what they did over the past two years ― nominating strong candidates, organizing supporters and turning out the vote. A lot of those Senate races were close and demographic trends at least should favor the party over time. The Democrats are making political progress and achieved a lot on Tuesday, more than disappointed partisans probably realize. But they will need to make even more gains, against the same old daunting odds, if they want to control the federal government again. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

According to AP VoteCast, women voted considerably more in favor of Democratic candidates. (Nov. 6) AP Republican Jim Jordan represents Ohio's 4th Congressional District. (Photo: Michael Reynolds, EPA) WASHINGTON – Conservative Republicans joined the president in blaming the establishment wing of their party for losing control of the House Tuesday, pointing to the wipeout of centrist Republicans as proof that the GOP needs to move further right. “The squishy members who lost their races were the ones that didn’t embrace that conservative agenda,” David McIntosh, the president of the conservative group Club for Growth, said at a press conference hosted by more than a half-dozen conservative leaders. The press conference held near Capitol Hill came as President Donald Trump gave his version of an election-night recap at the White House. The president went after some of the lawmakers who had lost and said they were unsuccessful because they didn’t embrace him. "Mia Love gave me no love and she lost, too bad,” Trump said, speaking of the incumbent representative from Utah. Democrats wrested the House from Republican control Tuesday gaining at least the 23 seats needed to flip the chamber. Some additional races were still too close to call as of Wednesday afternoon. The purge hit suburban Republicans particularly hard, knocking off centrists across the country from the suburbs of Virginia to Utah to California. “Republicans shed a lot of dead weight last night,” David Bozell president of ForAmerica, a conservative advocacy organization said. But some some conservatives who embraced Trump lost, including Reps. Dave Brat of Virginia, Rod Blum of Iowa and Claudia Tenney of New York. Because more-conservative members tend to be from safe Republican districts, most who ran for re-election will return to Congress next year. The GOP conference, though smaller, will be less centrist. Conservatives say that means it is time for a new direction for their leadership. They’re calling on Republicans to elect Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as minority leader. Jordan announced he was running for the post Tuesday morning. It is not clear that Jordan, who has angered many members of his own party, has the votes to win. He faces off against current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who also announced Wednesday he would be running for the job. Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has endorsed McCarthy. Former Republican Congressman Phil English, who represented Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2009, told USA TODAY that installing arch-conservatives into positions of leadership is not a winning plan for his party. English said Republicans should instead focus on “better outreach to suburbanites, to women, to swing voters. "I don’t think the Freedom Caucus approach has in any way been ratified by this election," English said.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who at long last turned in his resignation Wednesday after it was justifiably requested by President Trump – did more damage to the Trump presidency and to the nation than any public official in modern history. He clearly deserved to be fired long ago. The Republicans won the Senate, where they appoint judges; the Democrats took the House, where they fix parking tickets. The big story coming out of Tuesday’s midterm elections is how totally the news media missed the issue of what waves were building. America woke up Wednesday as divided as it was the day before the midterm elections, driven even further apart by two political parties that spent the campaign appealing to their base voters rather than trying to unify the country. As word trickled out Tuesday night that Democrats had recaptured the House, likely Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California wasted no time in celebrating the moment. I was actually on Fox News Channel on Election night when the channel’s Decision Desk called the House of Representatives for the Democrats. What fortuitous timing! The Republican Party defied history in a powerful and commanding fashion in the midterm elections Tuesday by expanding its Senate majority and stopping highly touted, celebrity-backed Democratic nominees in their tracks. The Republican loss of majority control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections should come as no surprise. The president’s party has traditionally lost an average of 32 seats in the House in midterms since 1862. Tuesday’s midterm election results confirm beyond a doubt that President Trump is a political force of nature like we’ve never seen. He has a hugely successful agenda that tens of millions of Americans support wholeheartedly. The midterm elections Tuesday – in which Democrats captured majority control of the House but Republicans kept their majority in the Senate – came at the end of a campaign marked by continuing media bias against President Trump and other Republicans. Latest opinion cartoons from FoxNews.com Ultimately, what won the day for Democrats on November 6 were the moderate messages and centrist campaigns that disavowed Nancy Pelosi and provided compelling alternatives to Republican policies. Despite spending more money than ever before for a midterm election, and even though they were confident of crushing a historically unpopular president, Democrats appear to have mustered only a slim majority in the House while not even coming close to taking over the Senate. Nancy Pelosi declared in her victory speech Tuesday night that we all have had enough of division. Leader Pelosi, please practice what you preach. Put those words into action. Govern, do not obstruct. Now that it is clear that the Democrats will control the House, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate that we can do something to pass serious legislation.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Elizabeth Podrebarac Sciupac and Gregory A. Smith A preliminary analysis of the 2018 midterm elections finds considerable continuity in the voting patterns of several key religious groups. White evangelical or born-again Christians backed Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives at about the same rate they did in 2014. Meanwhile, religiously unaffiliated voters (also known as religious “nones”) and Jewish voters once again backed Democratic candidates by large margins. Three-quarters (75%) of white voters who describe themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians (a group that includes Protestants, Catholics and members of other faiths) voted for Republican House candidates in 2018, according to National Election Pool (NEP) exit poll data reported by NBC News. That is on par with the share who did so in midterm elections in 2014 (78%) and 2010 (77%). At the other end of the spectrum, seven-in-ten religious “nones” voted for the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, which is virtually identical to the share of religious “nones” who voted for Democratic candidates in 2014 and 2010. Roughly eight-in-ten Jewish voters (79%) cast their ballots for the Democrats, higher than the share who did so in 2014, but somewhat shy of 2006 levels. (Data on Jewish voters were not available in 2010.) Read More → Topics: Voter Participation, Elections and Campaigns, U.S. Political Parties, Religion and U.S. Politics, 2018 Election By Samirah Majumdar Emergency laws entail the temporary suspension of normal judicial procedures and constitutional rights, typically in response to a national security threat. Depending on the circumstances, initial decrees can evolve into extended “states of emergency,” permitting governments to dramatically alter the protections normally extended to individuals and groups, including those defined by religion. In 2016, seven countries – Turkey, Brunei, Ethiopia, France, Hungary, Niger and Tunisia – used emergency laws that restricted religion within their borders. While the official justifications for these measures varied, Pew Research Center’s latest annual religious restrictions study finds that across the seven countries, Muslims, more than any other religious group, were specifically targeted by law enforcement and security services acting in accordance with emergency laws. This fact, along with others, helped place five of these seven countries among the 105 nations, globally, where government restrictions on religion rose in 2016. Religious restrictions, here, are defined in accordance with the Center’s annual Government Restrictions Index. The index is based on 20 indicators and uses a 10-point scale to rate countries as low, moderate, high or very high with regard to the overall level of religious restrictions. Overall, government restrictions rose in 105 of the 198 countries the report examined, including in five of the seven countries that declared states of emergency. Additionally, the number of countries with “high” or “very high” levels of restrictions rose to 28% of the total in 2016, up from 25% in 2015. Read More → Topics: Muslims and Islam, Religious Affiliation, Religion and Government, Restrictions on Religion By Drew DeSilver Many of the millions of Americans voting in Tuesday’s midterm elections will have to do so while working around the demands of their jobs – hitting their polling places before work, taking an extra-long lunch break or going afterward and hoping to make it before the polls close. As they stand in line, many of them may wonder why it is that the United States votes on a Tuesday, of all days. (To be fair, more than 38 million Americans already have voted early in person, by mail or by absentee ballot, according to a tally maintained by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald.) The first law designating Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November was passed back in 1845. At the time, every state except South Carolina was choosing its presidential electors by popular vote, and had considerable flexibility in deciding when to hold its elections. But as transportation and communications links between the states improved, concern grew that later-voting states could be influenced by the results in earlier-voting ones. (As the Congressional Globe wrote, paraphrasing one congressman’s remarks, “The object of this bill was to guard against frauds in the elections of President and Vice President, by declaring that they shall all be held on the same day.”) Read More → Topics: Voter Participation, Elections and Campaigns, 2018 Election By Besheer Mohamed Many more U.S. Muslims identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party than the GOP (66% vs. 13%), but the share who are Republican has held steady over the last 10 years, including after the election of President Donald Trump, according to a new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data collected between 2007 and 2017. In 2007, 11% of Muslims identified as Republican. The share changed very little in surveys conducted by the Center in 2011 (11%) and 2017 (13%). Sizable shares of both Republican and Democratic Muslims are critical of the way both parties treat U.S. Muslims. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans (57%) and about half of Democrats (47%) say neither party is friendly toward Muslims in America. This criticism may be one reason a relatively large share of Muslims neither identify with nor lean toward either party. Indeed, U.S. Muslims are twice as likely as the public overall to say they lean toward neither major political party (20% vs. 9%). Read More → Topics: Muslims and Islam, Religious Affiliation, Muslim Americans, U.S. Political Parties, Religion and U.S. Politics By Monica Anderson and Jingjing Jiang Many Americans have been politically active on social media, from encouraging others to take action to using issue-related hashtags. And liberal Democrats were more likely than other ideological and partisan groups to have engaged in these activities, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of survey data collected this summer. Liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media to mobilize others or find like-minded groups. Some 44% of liberal Democrats say they have used these sites in the past year to encourage others to take action on an issue that was important to them, while a similar share (43%) have taken part in a group that shares their interest in a cause, according to a survey of U.S. adults conducted May 29-June 11, 2018. These shares fall to around a third or fewer among conservative or moderate Democrats and among conservative, moderate or liberal Republicans. Read More → Topics: Social Media, Voter Participation, Internet Activities, 2018 Election, Political Issue Priorities By Hannah Hartig Voters are more enthusiastic about voting than in any midterm election in over 20 years of Pew Research Center polling. Still, millions of Americans will not exercise their right to vote on Tuesday. When people are asked about their overall impressions of voting, there is a broad consensus that voting is “important.” But smaller majorities say it is “convenient,” “straightforward” or “exciting,” according to a new Pew Research Center survey on elections in America. Young adults, in particular, are less likely than older people to say voting is convenient and exciting: 50% of adults younger than 30 say voting is convenient, while 49% say it is exciting. That compares with majorities in older age groups. Read More → Topics: Voter Participation, 2018 Election By Jacob Poushter and Moira Fagan Americans have more confidence in the leaders of France, Japan and Germany to do the right thing regarding world affairs than they have in U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted earlier this year. Majorities in the U.S. view French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel with confidence, while about half (48%) are confident that Trump will do the right thing internationally. Still, Americans are more likely than others around the world to have confidence in Trump: Across 25 other surveyed nations, a median of just 27% have confidence in the U.S. president. Of the seven leaders tested in the survey, Americans have the lowest levels of confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin, with about one-in-five (21%) saying he will do the right thing in world affairs. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi receive equivalent ratings: About four-in-ten (39%) in the U.S. have confidence in each. Read More → Topics: Non-U.S. Political Leaders, Foreign Affairs and Policy, Donald Trump By Ana Gonzalez-Barrera and Jens Manuel Krogstad More Hispanic registered voters say they have given “quite a lot” of thought to the upcoming midterm elections compared with four years ago and are more enthusiastic to vote this year than in previous congressional elections. But they lag behind the general public on some measures of voter engagement, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys. Overall, 52% of Latino registered voters say they have given the coming November election “quite a lot” of thought, a 16-percentage-point increase from what they said about the last midterm election in 2014. In addition, a majority (55%) of Latino registered voters in 2018 say they are more enthusiastic about voting compared with previous congressional elections, up from 37% in 2014. However, Hispanic voters are less likely than all U.S. voters to say they know about the congressional candidates in their district (47% vs. 59%, respectively). Also, one-third of Hispanic voters (33%) say “voting by people like me doesn’t really affect how government runs things,” while 25% of all U.S. voters say this. (Among those eligible to vote but not registered, 53% of Hispanics and 47% of the general public say the same.) More than 29 million Hispanics are eligible to vote, a new high, up 4 million from 2014. (Eligible voters are U.S. citizens ages 18 years and older.) However, Hispanic voter turnout has long trailed that of other groups. In 2014, an estimated 27% of Hispanic eligible voters cast a ballot, a record low and far below the turnout rate among black voters (41%) and white voters (46%). This year’s election comes at a time when most Latinos have grown dissatisfied with the nation’s direction and have more concerns about their place in American society. They also overwhelmingly disapprove of the president’s performance and see his administration’s policies as harmful to Latinos. Even so, not all Latinos feel the same way. Latino Republicans are generally more upbeat than Latino Democrats on these measures. Similar shares of both groups say they have given quite a lot of thought to the upcoming election and say they are more enthusiastic to vote than in previous congressional elections.

There are signs, though, of a turning tide: Younger newsroom employees show greater racial, ethnic and gender diversity than their older colleagues, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. More than three-quarters (77%) of newsroom employees – those who work as reporters, editors, photographers and videographers in the newspaper, broadcasting and internet publishing industries – are non-Hispanic whites, according to the analysis of 2012-2016 American Community Survey data. That is true of 65% of U.S. workers in all occupations and industries combined. Newsroom employees are also more likely than workers overall to be male. About six-in-ten newsroom employees (61%) are men, compared with 53% of all workers. When combining race/ethnicity and gender, almost half (48%) of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white men compared with about a third (34%) of workers overall. Read More → Topics: Newsroom Investment and Resources, Work and Employment, Race and Ethnicity, News Media Sectors By Jeffrey S. Passel, D’Vera Cohn and John Gramlich About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, the latest year for which information is available, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. This represents a 36% decrease from a peak of about 390,000 in 2007. The analysis follows President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration may seek to end “birthright citizenship.” Births to unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. generally rose throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s but have declined since the start of the Great Recession about a decade ago, according to estimates based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and its Current Population Survey. The number of babies born to unauthorized immigrant parents represented about 6% of the 4.0 million total births in the U.S. in 2016, compared with 9% of all births in 2007. Birthright citizenship derives from the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1868, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. The provision has long been interpreted to apply to U.S.-born children regardless of the immigration status of their parents. While the Center’s new analysis provides estimates about the number and share of U.S.-born babies with unauthorized immigrant parents, it’s important to note that the legal status of immigrant parents can change over time. For example, parents who have legal permission to be in the U.S. at the time of their child’s birth might later overstay their visas or otherwise become unauthorized. Similarly, parents who are unauthorized immigrants at the time of their child’s birth might later become lawful immigrants and then naturalized citizens.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/president-trump-has-replaced-ag-sessions-here-s-what-means-n933676---split---With Jeff Sessions now out as attorney general, President Donald Trump's choice to fill his shoes, at least temporarily, is in the position to have a significant impact on the scope of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Matthew Whitaker, who has served as Session's chief of staff since late 2017, has been tapped to become acting attorney general and will therefore take over the role of overseeing Mueller's probe from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sessions had recused himself from overseeing the probe because of his involvement with the campaign, but Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Flores said on Wednesday, "The acting attorney general is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice." For months, Trump publicly attacked Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the probe, and blamed his decision for allowing Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel. Now, with Whitaker at the helm, Trump has someone leading the Justice Department who has already suggested that Mueller's probe should be reined in. "If he was selected because he doesn't think it's an appropriate investigation, then I'm deeply concerned," said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and general counsel at the FBI. Before Whitaker came to the Justice Department in 2017, he wrote an op-ed for CNN that said Mueller's investigation was "going too far." He supported Trump's claim that the probe would be crossing a red line if it branched into the finances of Trump and his family. As a legal commentator on CNN, Whitaker also said that Sessions could be replaced with someone who would reduce Mueller's budget. "That attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt," Whitaker said in July 2017. Now Whitaker will be in the position to do just that. Previously, whenever Mueller has needed permission to expand his scope or add more resources, he went to Rosenstein. That responsibility will now fall to Whitaker. Rosenstein has also stood up to Republicans in Congress who have sought to publicly disclose documents related to the Russia investigation — a battle Whitaker may not be willing to fight. Trump's decision to replace Sessions with Whitaker rather than Rosenstein, the No. 2 at the Justice Department, has led to questions about the president's motives and whether the move strengthens Mueller's hand in pursuing an obstruction of justice case. "I think we're watching obstruction of justice play out in plain sight," Frank Figliuzzi, the former assistant director of counterintelligence at the FBI, said on MSNBC. Whitaker, 49, served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-09. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, he does not need to be sworn in or approved by the Senate to serve as the acting attorney general. He is allowed to serve 210 days before a full-time replacement who has been approved by the Senate must fill his spot. Julia Ainsley is a national security reporter for NBC News. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/trump-sessions-happy-midterms.html---split---Supported by Sure, the House is gone. But so is Jeff Sessions. By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Wow, Jeff Sessions was gone before they finished counting votes in Arizona. Do you think Donald Trump was trying to change the subject? Everybody knew he’d get a new attorney general after the elections, but we deserve to find out who won in Florida before we go back to 24/7 presidential pandemonium. Next year’s class of Democratic freshmen in the House is going to be incredible, with a huge range of backgrounds, ages, races and interests. Truly I did not expect to live to hear that a four-term Republican congressman from Kansas was defeated by a gay Native American woman who used to be a mixed martial arts fighter. Meanwhile, Trump was celebrating the probable defeat of the only Republican African-American woman in the history of the House of Representatives. (“Mia Love gave me no love and she lost!”) The president’s main theme was that an election in which Democrats won control of the House was actually “very close to complete victory” for his team, thanks to his unceasing efforts to rally support. This was during an hour-and-a-half-long press conference. For aficionados of Trumpian rhetoric, the big question was how long it would take him to mention the size of his crowds. Blink of an eye. (“We held a large number of campaign rallies with large, large numbers of people going to every one. To the best of my knowledge, we didn’t have a vacant or an empty seat.”) Other presidents were moved by polls or policy papers, but for Trump it’s always about what makes the crowds yell loudest. If any multibillionaires are interested in underwriting a movement that would genuinely make America great again, they need to hire masses of people to show up every time the president gives a speech. Everyone would stand there stonily during the rants about immigration, then burst into raucous applause whenever he talked about lower prescription drug prices or accidentally muttered a phrase like “better schools.” The nation would be transformed. Trump was in a benevolent mood on Wednesday — so much so that he got through the whole press conference without even once sniping about Hillary Clinton or Representative Maxine Waters. And Nancy Pelosi — he and “Nancy” were going to get along great. (“It really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation.”) As long as there were no, um, investigations or subpoenas for a person’s private tax returns. Which are being audited! Do you think the president and Congress could actually accomplish anything? There’s going to be a lot of talk about matters like health care reform. But you’ll notice any optimistic predictions usually wind up at road-building. “The one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning is where — where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement, would be something on infrastructure,” said Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell added he was sure there would be “a lot of other things,” too. But he didn’t seem able to come up with any. The moral is: Everybody loves pothole repair. Before we leave the midterms behind, what was your favorite election outcome? I liked the one in Pennsylvania where Scott Wagner, the Republican candidate for governor, lost to the incumbent, Tom Wolf. Wagner was the guy who did a video warning his opponent to put on a catcher’s mask because “I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.” Farewell, Scott. Gone but not forgotten. Republican Representative Paul Gosar won re-election in Arizona. He’s the Tea Party favorite who’s called for Justice Department officials to be tried for treason. (Jeff Sessions: the one that got away.) But Gosar became nationally famous only when six of his siblings made an ad begging voters to support his opponent. Too bad that didn’t work. But at least Gosar will now be known forever as the Congressman Whose Family Ran Against Him. In several states voters gave thumbs-up to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. In Idaho, retiring Republican Gov. Butch Otter called it an “Idaho-grown solution.” Perhaps this makes you think of Obamacare as some kind of potato, but I’m bringing it up since this may be my last excuse to mention the name Butch Otter in a column. Farewell, Gov. Butch Otter! On the brighter side, Florida is once again sending Representative Ted Yoho back to Washington. And thanks to voters in Utah, there will be new opportunities to discuss the fact that once, long ago, Senator-elect Mitt Romney drove to Canada on a family vacation with the dog strapped to the roof of his car. The big question now is whether we should wait until after the holidays to start discussing the election in 2020. Is Beto O’Rourke going to go on a long vacation or will he start looking really available before Thanksgiving? Does Cory Booker ever take vacations? Did anybody notice Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders won new terms this week? Do you think any Republicans will try to run against Trump? John Kasich is certainly making himself look available. And what’s Jeff Sessions going to do with the rest of his life? So much to do, so little time to obsess about it.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/midterm-elections-2018-hacking-media-manipulation-caravan/---split---On Monday morning, just 24 hours before polls opened in the US midterm elections, President Trump sounded an alarm with a Tweet: “Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalty allowed by law. Thank you!” The rumor was part of a pair; over the weekend, Trump tweeted that Indiana senator Joe Donnelly was “trying to steal the election” by buying Facebook ads for the libertarian Senate candidate. Both tweets are examples of a disturbing trend in American elections: By spreading misinformation, Trump sought to shift the outcome of the midterms. Our elections are becoming less free, less fair, and less trustworthy. They are threatened from multiple angles, with foreign and domestic actors seeking to bend, break, or reinvent the rules to suit their liking. By spreading rumors on social media and amplifying choice stories into a 24-hour news cycle, these bad actors can sway the political narrative and hack an election without even touching a voting machine. David Karpf (@davekarpf) is an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University and the author of The MoveOn Effect. One of the lessons from the past two election cycles is that there are many ways to hack an election. They aren’t all equally dangerous. If we’re going to make sense of how elections are being distorted in the digital age, we need to start by making some distinctions. Let’s start with propaganda. Since 2016, digital propaganda and misinformation campaigns have become increasingly sophisticated. This is partially because foreign actors have taken a greater interest in exploiting the vulnerabilities of the American system, and partially because social media is particularly vulnerable to organized misinformation campaigns. Cambridge Analytica became the poster child for these efforts to “hack our brains” after the 2016 election. Facebook, Google, and Twitter spent much of 2018 trying to identify and root out similar efforts. As the dust settles on the election, you should expect to see reports coming out about the newest advances in weaponized digital propaganda. But among the various forms of election hacking, weaponized propaganda is the most common and the least effective. The problem is that it’s difficult to persuade voters to do anything. An estimated $5 billion was spent on legitimate, legal efforts to persuade voters, through television advertisements, digital advertisements, phone banks, and door knocks. Some of that was spent by the candidates and parties; some was spent by shady but legal outside interests. In the weeks leading up to election day, voters are inundated with political messages, and the resulting sludge limits the impact of any one individual message, good or bad. Viral disinformation doesn’t spread in a vacuum; it adds additional chaos and confusion into an already chaotic system. Viral disinformation doesn’t spread in a vacuum; it adds additional chaos and confusion into an already chaotic system. A second option, the indirect approach, is more powerful: “hacking the media,” if you will. Instead of reaching voters directly through digital propaganda, outside actors can try to interfere by influencing the news narrative. When WikiLeaks dumped the contents of John Podesta’s hacked email account in 2016, mainstream media organizations poured over the emails, and related stories dominated the headlines for weeks. There’s already evidence of similar efforts in 2018. Last week, WIRED’s Issie Lapowsky reported that 60 percent of the online conversation about the migrant caravan was likely attributable to bots. The bots amplified the story online, helping to make it the center of the media conversation, which in turn impacted the narrative of the election in its closing days. Does hacking the media work? Yeah. Is it illegal? Well … no. One of the oldest findings in the field of political communication research is that the media’s biggest impact tends to be in agenda-setting. “The media may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about,” Max McCombs and Donald Shaw wrote in their field-defining 1972 paper. Awash in electoral messages, the media’s enduring strength is in focusing public attention. When voters are deciding whether to vote and whom to vote for, their decision is shaped by recency bias, the phenomenon that the headlines dominating the news in the weeks leading up to election day become the issues that voters care about most. The migrant caravan triggers white identity politics, activating enthusiasm among Trump supporters who perceive nonwhite migrants as an existential threat. If the final weeks of the election had been focused on health care coverage and preexisting conditions, those same supporters might have been less enthusiastic. That would have mattered in some tight races. Of course, this media hack is mostly accomplished through signal-boosting, not botnets. American elections have a long tradition of “October surprises,” the last-minute scandals strategically placed in the month before Election Day to dominate the narrative. When President Trump sent 15,000 troops to the border and Fox News aired wall-to-wall stories about the impending threat of a caravan proceeding on foot from 1,000 miles away, they were joining a historical pattern. The new digital influence operations are new variations on a classic theme. When President Trump sent 15,000 troops to the border he was joining a historical pattern. Then there is voter suppression. Voter suppression is dangerously effective and extraordinarily antidemocratic, but it can only be deployed by government actors. Voter suppression isn’t just negative messages that depress turnout. It is active, structural work that creates barriers to voting—kicking voters off the rolls, closing polling locations, implementing poll taxes, and so on. After the Supreme Court invalidated much of the Voting Rights Act in a 2013 ruling, a select few Republicans have implemented some audacious schemes to maintain partisan control by picking and choosing which voters would be able to cast a ballot. Brian Kemp in Georgia has become the new face of voter suppression. In his dual role as Georgia secretary of state (charged with overseeing elections) and Republican candidate for governor (charged with winning the election), Kemp employed every trick in the book. He challenged the registration of tens of thousands of African American voters. He shut down polling places in heavily Democratic precincts. He left polling places so under-resourced that voters had to wait more than five hours to cast a ballot. Forget the propaganda campaigns—if you really want to influence the outcome of an election, just kick the other side’s likely voters off the rolls. Finally, there is the most dangerous category: direct tampering with voting machines and databases. There have been strident warnings from election security experts that our voting systems are vulnerable to outright vote tampering by hostile foreign actors. There is no evidence at this point that direct vote tampering has occurred. But there’s more cause for alarm than there used to be. And as Zeynep Tufekci points out, the creeping uncertainty surrounding electoral legitimacy has many of the same practical effects as election hacking. Democracies cease to function when citizens stop trusting that elections are free and fair. The aftermath of the 2016 election was bewildering, both because of the ongoing revelations of foreign influence operations and because of the varying ways that the term “hacking the election” was employed. Foreign actors did try to hack our brains in 2016, but it’s debatable how much that mattered given all the other methods of hacking our system. The 2018 election is over, but the lessons from 2018 have just begun. We’re going to spend the next few months learning just how various actors, foreign and domestic, tried to influence the election. There’s a lot of work to be done to shore up this electoral system and repair public confidence in the process. Step 1, which begins today, is getting the terminology right. In a few days we'll be voting for the 45th President of the United States. Let's take a look at some of the numbers and see what facts and figures are important to every election.

Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington. Our coverage of California politics is here. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for the free politics newsletter The White House on Wednesday suspended the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Trump had a heated confrontation during a news conference. They began sparring after Acosta asked Trump about the caravan of migrants heading from Latin America to the southern U.S. border. When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, "That's enough!" and a female White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement accusing Acosta of "placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern," calling it "absolutely unacceptable." President Trump sparred with reporters at his post-election news conference, ordering several to sit down and telling another he's a "rude, terrible" person. He told another reporter he's "not a fan of yours, either." The president's mood turned sour Wednesday after reporters pressed him on why he referred to a migrant caravan making its way to the U.S. on foot through Mexico as an "invasion." Trump ramped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric against the caravan in the final days of the midterm elections.

Standing beside Cox on Saturday, Kim predicted that a string of GOP victories Tuesday would start with voters repealing the gas tax hike. "Can you imagine Gavin Newsom being our governor? Can you imagine Gil Cisneros being your representative?" Kim asked the crowd, to loud boos and cries of "Nooo!" Judging from the cheers in the crowd, about half those assembled at Katie Porter’s campaign headquarters in Mission Viejo Sunday morning were old enough to remember ’70s rock ’n’ roll star Bowzer from the band Sha Na Na. Jon Bauman, as “Bowzer” is known off stage, said it was her position on senior issues including retirement and social security that has him out supporting Porter over her opponent, incumbent Rep. Mimi Walters. “I want you to make sure every phone is called and every door is knocked,” he told the crowd of about 80 volunteers. “There has never been a more important election.” Gil Cisneros got on stage with comedian Chelsea Handler on Sunday afternoon, urging his supporters to help him reach as many voters as possible to get out the vote in the 39th Congressional District, where he’s hoping to snag a seat held by retiring Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton). “This election really is going to come down to the wire,” he said. Within the hour, Cisneros was knocking on doors in a nearby Buena Park neighborhood full of tidy ranch-style homes with neatly trimmed lawns and within earshot of roller-coaster screams emanating from Knott’s Berry Farm. One of the first voters he encountered were Nicolas Cervantes and his wife, Julia, who took a break from yardwork to shake his hand. They and their two kids are voting for him, he said.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-bill-midterm-elections_us_5be36fdae4b0769d24c8b3a6---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: WASHINGTON ― At the outset of the 2018 midterms, the head of the top Republican super PAC tasked with saving the GOP House majority had a stark message. “There is no positive outcome in November if we do not show that we cut taxes for the middle class and are working to make their lives better,” Corry Bliss, the director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, wrote in a January memo. But Republicans didn’t take his advice. Even his own super PAC didn’t fully take his advice. The Congressional Leadership Fund was one of the first branches of the GOP campaign arm to largely abandon the tax cuts and instead run on fear, racial anxiety and culture war issues, doing so in a ﻿March special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District. The failure to take that advice ― to make the tax cuts popular and try to run on that popularity ― may have sealed the GOP’s fate. Although Republicans staved off Democrats in many districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, the GOP couldn’t stop Democrats from flipping many of the districts Hillary Clinton took two years ago. A booming economy and bigger paychecks were supposed to help Republicans in these districts, often in upper-crust suburbs. Instead, that wasn’t enough. Nearly every Republican interviewed for this story agreed the party could have done a better job selling the tax cut law. But Democrats argue that the problem was the policy: Voters just didn’t buy anymore that tax cuts for the wealthy trickle down to the middle class. “You might be able to sell New Coke,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who has helped marshal the anti-tax cut messaging. “You can’t sell New Arsenic. The problem here wasn’t the promotion. It was the policy.” When the GOP rolled out the tax law, Democrats were worried. While projecting confidence, they started polling elements of the tax bill in October 2017. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other groups found that if they didn’t counter the GOP messaging, Republicans would win the fight. So Democrats tried to define the tax bill by emphasizing who was prioritized in the bill — mainly large corporations and the rich. “It’s important to remember: Tax cuts are supposed to be popular,” DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly told HuffPost this week. The most worrying period for Democrats came in January and February, when large corporations and businesses were seemingly announcing new bonuses for workers every day and crediting them to the tax bill. At one point, the legislation’s approval rating hit 50 percent in a New York Times poll. And then the momentum stalled, in part because the bonuses dried up and the bill proved largely unhelpful to many people. The legislation did put a little more money in most voters’ hands. The average household in the middle 20 percent of incomes should be getting 1.3 percent more take-home pay because of lower rates this year, according to a March analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center. But the law cut taxes more substantially for wealthier individuals. Taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles will have 3.4 percent more income after taxes. The law also slathered money on corporations. Contrast the temporary tax cut of a few percentage points for individuals with the permanent 40 percent tax cut for corporations. Voters seemed to think the tax code changes were meant not for them but for businesses. Republicans claimed a drastically lower corporate tax rate would boost hiring and wages, and they pointed to a series of corporate bonus announcements as proof. When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) described the bonuses as “crumbs” relative to what corporations got, Republicans spent weeks highlighting her comment as wacky and out of touch. But the bonuses really were crumbs compared with the wave of shareholder-enriching stock buybacks that the law inspired this year. Workers might not have even noticed the tiny tax cut in their paychecks next to other changes, such as different retirement withholdings and health insurance premium increases. “There was a nexus of Republicans, the Trump White House and big, wealthy corporations trying to sell this plan,” Ferguson said. “We weren’t delusional about what we were up against. But every time a CEO spoke about how great the plan was, it confirmed to voters that this was a plan for CEOs.” The DCCC also emphasized how important it was for Democrats to focus on how much more the rich were benefiting, rather than getting into an argument about how much money was going to individuals’ pockets. “We wanted to make loud and clear to regular people that they were not put first,” Kelly said. Despite strong economic growth ― gross domestic product rose 3.5 percent in the third quarter relative to the previous year ― wage growth has been weak. Adjusted for inflation, real earnings for most workers have risen by less than 1 percent annually in any given month this year. In the fourth quarter of 2006, which also saw 3.5 percent GDP growth, wages outpaced inflation by more than 2 percent each month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The first real political test for the tax bill came during that special election in Pennsylvania early in 2018. Republicans had just passed their tax bill, and they were pushing their candidate there, Rick Saccone, to use the legislation against Democratic candidate Conor Lamb. But Lamb argued ― in a heavily Republican district ― that while he supported tax cuts generally, he didn’t support a giveaway to corporations and the rich and he certainly didn’t support increasing the deficit and potentially trimming Medicare and Social Security. Lamb was able to tie the deficit-busting tax cuts to possible reductions for Medicare and Social Security, capitalizing on comments that House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) made about the need for entitlement reform. The strategy worked. Saccone lost the race. And suddenly Republicans were a little more gun shy about running on tax cuts. As lawmakers began campaigning in earnest this year, Republicans barely mentioned the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in their ads. Democrats, meanwhile, hired comedy writers to skewer the law. The DCCC also said its messaging worked partly because Republicans had soured voters by trying to gut health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. “That poisoned the well,” DCCC national press secretary Tyler Law told HuffPost. Kelly and Law said it would have been much harder for Democrats to neutralize the tax cut issue if Republicans had passed that law before trying to repeal Obamacare. Over the summer, the tax law faded from the national political consciousness. North Korea, Trump’s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and Trump’s threats to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions dominated the news. Democrats relentlessly focused on health care. The Republican position in crucial House districts deteriorated. Around Labor Day, the Club for Growth ― a conservative group that pushed for the tax cuts ― ran a poll of swing districts. It found a massive enthusiasm gap in Democrats’ favor and tested ways to solve it. “The strongest of these was defending the tax cuts and making them permanent,” pollsters Chris Wilson and Byron Allen of WPA Intelligence wrote in a memo summarizing their findings. “Defending the tax cuts and making them permanent was both the strongest persuasive message in moving swing voters to vote for Republicans and the strongest message in creating additional interest in the election among Republican voters.” The group shared the data with Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), but nothing changed. “They completely ignored the data,” said David McIntosh, the Club for Growth’s president and an Indiana former congressman. “It was a classic failure of the establishment Republican Party to run on issues that were helpful to them.” He argued that Democrats were backing away from their opposition to the law, with fewer and fewer calling for outright repeal and some musing about making the tax cuts permanent for individuals. He said Republicans could have saved its members like Rep. Dave Brat, who lost a seat in suburban Richmond, Virginia, if they had focused more on the tax cuts. The National Republican Campaign Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund contest claims that they didn’t run on the tax bill. NRCC communications director Matt Gorman told HuffPost that Republicans did campaign on an economic message, releasing a handful of ads a week before Election Day that mostly mentioned tax cuts and the economy. “I also think it shouldn’t preclude us from going into the candidates’ background and digging into opposition research,” he said. What he likely meant by that are nuggets like New York Democrat Antonio Delgado once being a rapper, Minnesota Democrat Dan Feehan being employed by a “[George] Soros–funded liberal outfit in D.C.” and connecting Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin to Pelosi and rioting mobs because “Slotkin is one of them,” according to ads paid for by the NRCC. Republicans may have talked about the tax bill and the strong economy, but it was far from the overwhelming message. According to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost in September, just under 12 percent of GOP TV ads mentioned the tax bill, out of 396,607 TV spots analyzed. And despite what Republicans claim, those numbers likely got worse during the final two months of the campaign, as Trump and the GOP focused on a ginned-up crisis centered on Central American asylum seekers walking toward the southwestern U.S. border, the so-called caravan. That strategy prevented a true blue wave from gathering, staving off Democratic pickups in districts where Trump and his racially charged messages have traction. But in suburban, affluent, educated districts ― where “country club Republicans” are increasingly turning against the president ― the failure of Republicans to capitalize on their tax bill might have been one of the reasons they lost there.

On this week’s podcast, we take a close look at the candidates in the races for governor and U.S. Senate. We also dive deep into the congressional battleground of Orange County — home to four closely watched contests. And we examine the potential impact if the polls are right and two major California ballot measures are rejected. In his last campaign as governor, Jerry Brown rallied Friday against Proposition 6, tying the initiative to supporters of President Trump and warning it will hinder California’s efforts to repair roads and bridges. “Prop. 6 is a scheme and a scam put on the ballot by some partisans,” Brown said at a campaign rally in Palo Alto. “Actually they are acolytes of Donald Trump. They don't have the best interest of California in mind." The measure, which would repeal an increase in the state’s gas tax and vehicle fees, was qualified for Tuesday’s ballot by a committee funded by the GOP leaders including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox. Republican leaders hope the measure will drive conservative voters to the polls on Tuesday to boost the chances of their party’s candidates. A man accused of mailing bombs to top Democratic officials and public figures researched a state legislator from Southern California as a potential target, according to the lawmaker’s office. A spokesman for Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) said the FBI notified the lawmaker of his connection with the case on Tuesday. Lara, a candidate for California insurance commissioner, has not received any suspicious packages. “The FBI notified Sen. Lara that the suspect researched him as a possible target,” said Michael Soller, Lara’s spokesman. “He had a conversation with the FBI and the investigation is ongoing.” Proposals to address the state’s housing-affordability problems fill the November statewide ballot. On this episode of Gimme Shelter: The California Housing Crisis Podcast, we talk about all of them. Gubernatorial candidates Gavin Newsom and John Cox have made housing affordability central to their platforms, and we detail what they both want to do. And we break down the four housing ballot measures voters will decide on: Less than a week before the election, the California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento was evacuated for two hours Wednesday after the police bomb squad was called in to investigate a suspicious package received in the mail. The evacuation ended around 2 pm after a team of FBI and Sacramento Police Department officials determined the large envelope was not dangerous. State Party Chairman Eric Bauman said the package arrived at party headquarters just days after a Florida man was arrested for allegedly sending pipe bombs to Democratic leaders including former President Obama and the Sacramento office of U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Gov. Jerry Brown calls Proposition 6 “dangerous” in a new digital ad that warns the initiative that would repeal an increase in the gas tax jeopardizes $5 billion annually in road repairs and transportation projects. A week before the statewide election, the “No on 6” campaign put the ad up on social media. It will also run this week in select markets on broadcast and cable television. It features footage of Brown in a suit and tie interspersed with scenes of road and bridge construction projects. “We are finally making progress,” Brown says in the ad. “Thousands of road repairs are under way, fixing bridges and overpasses to meet earthquake standards and improving the safety of our roads. But Proposition 6 would stop these critical repairs.” Kicking off a week-long bus tour in the run-up to election day, Gavin Newsom cast the stakes of the upcoming election in national — even international — terms. “It’s not an exaggeration to say not just the country but the world is looking to all of you at this moment, the next seven days, to step up and to step in and to send a message and repudiate this moment,” Newsom told a crowd of supporters at San Francisco City Hall on Tuesday. “Because we are better than Washington, D.C. We’re better than Trump and Trumpism. We’re better than the rhetoric and the reality of the last 72 hours.” The Democratic lieutenant governor spent less time touting his own candidacy for governor than taking jabs at President Trump and urging get-out-the-vote efforts for Democratic congressional candidates. Proposition 6 campaign leader Carl DeMaio on Monday threatened a recall campaign against state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra for providing what he said was a misleading ballot title for the measure that would repeal increases in the gas tax and vehicle fees. DeMaio said he filed papers Monday with the Secretary of State’s Office to form a campaign committee for a possible Becerra recall effort. He estimated that it would cost about $1 million to collect the 856,335 signatures needed to put a recall on the ballot. “These politicians have stolen our gas tax money and now they are trying to steal our ‘yes’ vote on Prop. 6 and turn it into a ‘no’ vote, and for that there must be a punishment that is extracted,” DeMaio said during a press conference on the steps of the state Capitol building. “We intend to recall the attorney general, Xavier Becerra, over his attempt to defraud the voters of their ‘yes’ vote on Prop. 6.” Currently California cities and towns aren't permitted to pass rent control measures to address the affordable housing crisis. That should change. Municipalities should have the freedom to deal with the decline in affordable housing and rising rents. Let's pass Prop 10. Copyright © 2018, Los Angeles Times

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/5-surprises-2018-midterm-elections---split---Republican Senate candidate for Indiana Mike Braun defeated Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, by nearly double digits. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Most midterm elections have dozens of individual House and Senate races that remain unpredictable right up until — and after — the polls close on Election Day. The 2018 cycle was no different, with 22 House and three Senate races still uncalled by 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. But each year, there are a few races that experts thought they had a handle on, only to be flummoxed by the results. Here are five surprise results from Tuesday night: Republican businessman Mike Braun, who painted himself as a political outsider in the GOP primary against two Republican members of Congress, cruised past Sen. Joe Donnelly on Tuesday, outpacing the Democratic incumbent by nearly double digits. Polls had the Senate contest in the Hoosier State neck-and-neck heading into Tuesday. It wasn’t so much that Braun won that was surprising — by Election Day, Indiana was the only Senate race that remained a Tossup, according to ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales — as it was the margin by which he dispatched Donnelly. Braun’s resounding victory dealt an early, crushing blow to Senate Democrats’ already-small hopes of eking out a path to a majority in the upper chamber. Donnelly appeared to have a handle on his re-election bid after winning his primary. But Braun began to pick up momentum in the fall, partly because Republicans were tuning in late, partly because he kicked more of his own money into his campaign, and partly because of the confirmation chaos surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Donnelly, whose tenure will end after just one term in a state Trump won by nearly 20 points, was one of three Democrats to vote for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. But his break with Trump on Kavanaugh may have turned off some GOP and independent voters who’d been willing to stick with him over Braun. This was one of those results that, for many viewers at home, probably came out of left field. Us, too. Former Democratic congressional aide Kendra Horn pulled off the upset of the night for Democrats by defeating Republican Rep. Steve Russell in Oklahoma’s 5th District, which includes Oklahoma City. Trump won Russell’s district by nearly 14 points in 2016, and Russell never told the National Republican Congressional Committee that he was in any trouble in his bid for a third term, a source with knowledge of the conversations told Roll Call. Inside Elections rated the race Solid Republican. Democrats in Washington will be happy to have Horn, who had this to say: 👀  When it became clear on Tuesday that Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton would sail to victory over Virginia GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, many experts, including Roll Call political reporter Simone Pathe, predicted the result would prove a good omen for other Democratic challengers in heavily suburban, GOP-held districts. Those predictions rang true, as Democrats booted suburban Republican incumbents en route to a House majority. You didn't have to look far from Wexton’s 10th District for other examples. Former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger felled hardline conservative Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th District with a strong showing in the Richmond suburbs. And on the coast in Virginia’s 2nd District, U.S. Navy veteran Elaine Luria upset GOP Rep. Scott Taylor, whose campaign was mired in scandal after local news outlets discovered four of his campaign staffers submitted petition sheets with forged signatures in an alleged scheme to put a former Democratic candidate on the ballot to siphon votes away from Luria. Both Luria and Spanberger blew past historical Democratic deficits in party favorability in the districts. Trump carried the 2nd District by 3.4 points and the 7th District by 6.5 points in 2016. One Democratic operative in Virginia described the mood Tuesday night as “absolute ecstasy and insanity.” Inside Elections had rated Spanberger’s race against Brat a Tossup and Luria’s race against Taylor Tilts Republican. With all precincts reporting in Georgia’s 6th District, Democratic activist Lucy McBath appears poised to upset GOP Rep. Karen Handel. McBath led Handel by 2,872 votes as of noon on Wednesday. Inside Elections had rated the race Leans Republican. Handel defeated state lawmaker Jon Ossoff in a special election for the suburban Atlanta district in 2017 that received national attention as a test of Trump's popularity in white suburban areas. Ossoff raised and spent a record $31 million on that election. McBath, just two weeks before the election, had raised $1.2 million. That’s 3 percent of Ossoff’s haul. Handel beat Ossoff by 3.8 percent. A few miles to the east, in Georgia's 7th District, a mirror image of the 6th in terms of demographics and economic status, the outcome is also razor thin, though, for now, it favors Republican incumbent Rob Woodall. With all precincts reporting by noon Wednesday, Woodall, whose race Inside Elections also rated Leans Republican, led by 1,299 votes. Democrat Joe Cunningham’s win in South Carolina’s 1st District is a blow to Republicans who thought they’d hold on to the coastal seat even after South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford lost a GOP primary earlier this year. Tuesday’s upset was another example of the perils Republicans face when they elect hardline conservatives like Katie Arrington over more moderate incumbents in the primaries. Trump carried the Charleston-area seat by 11 points in 2016. Trump openly supported Arrington over Sanford, one of the few members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who has spoken ill of the president. But Sanford may have gotten the last laugh after the president’s hand-picked candidate fell short in the general election in a race Republicans should have won.

---split---7.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ron-desantis-florida-governor-andrew-gillum-concedes/story?id=58904451---split---A rising Democratic star's political hopes to capture the governor's mansion in Florida were halted Tuesday night after Andrew Gillum conceded to former Rep. Ron DeSantis in the state's contentious gubernatorial race. Gillum conceded just before 11 p.m. ET, setting up a victory for President Donald Trump-backed DeSantis. "Earlier this evening I called Mr. Ron Desantis and congratulated him on what we expect will be him as the next governor as the great state of Florida," Gillum said. "I want you to know that in spite of our congratulating him on his victory this evening, nothing that we believe in is compromised."   "I still believe and I still trust the voters," he added. "We may not have always shown up but I still believe that there are more of us that believe in what is common and what is good." "But I can guarantee you this," he continued, "I'm not going anywhere." DeSantis thanked Floridians for the vote of confidence. "Other than serving our nation in uniform, the opportunity to serve as the 46th governor of the great state of Florida is the greatest professional honor of my life," he said in his victory speech Tuesday night. "Thank you, the people of Florida, for your faith, your support, and your trust you have placed in me. The close nature of this election continued Florida's tradition of having consequential elections. Trump endorsed DeSantis shortly after he won his primary earlier this year, and the president went on to campaign for him in his so-called second home state. Trump carried the state by a slim margin over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.   Last week, Trump entered into the fray to defend his staunch ally by relentlessly criticizing the Democratic hopeful over Twitter and at a rally for DeSantis in Fort Myers. Branding Gillum as a "stone-cold thief" and a "radical socialist," Trump ignited tensions in the contest's final days.   For his part, Gillum faced controversy earlier this year over an FBI probe into government corruption in Tallahassee and accepting a ticket to the Broadway musical "Hamilton" from an undercover FBI agent. Gillum said during a gubernatorial debate that he's not the direct subject of the investigation. But Trump wasn't the only presidential player who waded into this state-level race, as former President Barack Obama rallied for Gillum just days before voters headed to the polls to energize an already animated democratic base.   This tight battle between Gillum and DeSantis has at times become heated, particularly over race. The day after Gillum won the party's nomination in the August primary, DeSantis came under fire for telling voters during a Fox News interview that they should not "monkey this up" by voting for Gillum. An occasionally controversial opponent, DeSantis said during one debate that he would represent all Floridians, regardless of race, but would not participate in political correctness. Gillum responded: "I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist."   Florida Democrats hoped to use the election as a referendum on Trump and highlight issues that have affected their state, like environmental disasters, gun policy and economic development. The state is the site of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 students and teachers were killed in one of the country's deadliest mass shootings. Republicans campaigned on maintaining the economic growth fostered under Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who was term-limited and is running for Senate in the state this year. Gillum, who scored Obama's endorsement last month and who was joined by former Vice President Joe Biden on the trail, was part of a progressive class of candidates who are dominating the Democratic ticket this cycle. More aligned with Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and liberal insurgent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Tallahassee mayor surged onto the scene in the final weeks leading into his primary victory in August.   Floridians were visibly invested in this race, with 3.1 million primary voters breaking midterm records in late August.
---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/gonzales/its-not-too-early-to-start-looking-at-the-2020-senate-map---split---Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is up for re-election in 2020 in a state carried by both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The votes haven’t all been counted in the 2018 Senate elections, but we know the size of the incoming majority will be critical, because the 2020 Senate map offers limited initial takeover opportunities for both parties. Of course, it’s too early to tell what the presidential race will look like, how voters will feel about the economy and direction of the country, and whether they’ll believe more Democrats are needed in Washington.  The next class of senators was last elected in 2014 — a great midterm year for Republicans in which they gained nine seats. But the consequence of having a good year in the Senate is having to defend those seats six years later. Republicans will be playing more defense next cycle, defending at least 21 Senate seats while Democrats will be defending 12 — the opposite dynamic from this cycle. The shape of the presidential race matters, considering 2016 was the first time in the history of popularly elected senators that the Senate outcomes matched the presidential outcomes in every state. If you apply the 2016 presidential results to the 2020 Senate class, the result is no net change. Using the 2012 presidential results as a guide, Democrats would gain two Senate seats by losing Alabama and picking up Colorado, Maine, and Iowa. If the 2008 presidential results applied, Democrats would gain three seats by losing Alabama and taking over Colorado, Iowa, Maine, and North Carolina. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly), Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 Usually the races are more complex and the size of the Senate playing field will also depend on retirements, recruitment and primaries, beyond the presidential map. What immediately stands out about the 2020 Senate landscape is the initial lack of vulnerable Democratic senators. Doug Jones of Alabama is the only Democratic senator representing a state that Donald Trump and Mitt Romney carried in the last two presidential elections. Jones was elected in a December 2017 special election with 50 percent over Roy Moore, who had significant baggage from his past. Jones will start as an underdog in his re-election race. Gary Peters of Michigan is the only other Democratic senator from a state that Trump won in 2016 (albeit with 47.5 percent). But Obama carried Michigan with 54 percent and we saw in 2018 that most of the Democratic senators from states Trump carried narrowly were at limited risk. (And a Democrat won the governorship in Michigan on Tuesday night.) At least two Democratic senators who are up for re-election are eyeing presidential bids: Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. If they chose to give up their seats to focus on the White House, competitive primaries would likely ensue, but Democrats would start as favorites to hold both states. Most of the action on the Democratic side could be in primaries to take on GOP senators. Senate Democrats largely avoided them this cycle because they had savvy incumbents seeking re-election in challenging states. But open opportunities to take on Republicans will be a different story. The crowded and competitive House primaries in 2018 are likely a precursor to what will happen in the Senate next cycle. And those races will likely play host to fights over ideology and the power of the establishment, with potential general election consequences. Democrats could also see a challenge to one of their incumbents. According to a September story in The New York Times, Rep. Seth Moulton is considering a primary challenge to Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The race wouldn’t have general election consequences but would be another sign of anti-establishment fervor within the Democratic Party. Every cycle, there is a least one retirement and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois might be one of them. Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos is close to the senator and would be an obvious successor if a spot in House leadership or a spot as a running mate on a presidential ticket doesn’t conflict. Based on the 2016 presidential results, Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine would be the most vulnerable senators, as the only two Republicans in states that Clinton carried in 2016. There won’t be any shortage of Democrats looking to take on Gardner, particularly after his vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his cycle as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And Democratic donors around the country rallied to raise more than $4 million for a Collins challenger in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings. Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina represent Trump states that Obama carried previously and should be regarded as initially vulnerable as well. Trump and Romney carried Arizona, but uncertainty surrounding the late John McCain’s seat could make it interesting. The seat will be on the ballot in November 2020. Republican retirements are also a possibility. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is 82 years old and faced a competitive primary in 2014, which he won 48 percent to 41 percent. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma is 83 years old, but doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. Competitive primaries are likely if either or both seats open up. Some GOP incumbents could face primary challengers. For Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, that could be Mark Green, who hasn’t even been sworn in yet as the congressman from the 7th District. Alexander won his 2014 primary by 9 points and with just less than 50 percent against six candidates. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has been a vocal Trump critic, which should draw him a primary challenger, even though there isn’t an initial obvious choice. With Nebraska likely to lose a congressional seat before the 2022 elections, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry might attempt a jump to the Senate in 2020 instead of facing off against fellow Reps. Don Bacon or Adrian Smith in a primary down the road. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina looked likely to draw a primary challenge after being critical of Trump during the 2016 campaign. But he’s since done a 180 and was given credit for turning around Kavanaugh’s confirmation. One of the most fascinating races in the country next cycle could be in Kentucky. Sen. Mitch McConnell has proved his skills as majority leader and as a campaigner, but his unfavorable rating has climbed over the years and he seems likely to face another competitive race. While the presidential race will suck up most of the oxygen in the 2020 room, the fight for the Senate should once again be a prime battle.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.people-press.org/2018/11/05/more-now-say-its-stressful-to-discuss-politics-with-people-they-disagree-with/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  U.S. Politics & Policy Liberal Democrats most likely to say it is stressful Over the past two years, Americans have become more likely to say it is “stressful and frustrating” to have political conversations with those they disagree with. The change in opinions has come largely among Democrats: 57% now say that talking about politics with people they disagree with is stressful and frustrating, up from 45% two years ago. By contrast, Republicans’ feelings about political conversations with people they disagree have changed very little. About half (49%) continue to find such conversations stressful and frustrating. Overall, 53% of Americans say talking about politics with people they disagree with is generally stressful and frustrating; fewer (45%) say such conversations are usually “interesting and informative.” In March 2016, during the presidential primaries, slightly more found such conversations interesting and informative (51%) than stressful and frustrating (46%). The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 24 to Oct. 7, also finds that a majority of Americans (63%) say that when discussing politics with people they disagree with they find they usually have less in common politically than they thought. Views of whether such conversations lead to more common ground politically – unlike opinions about whether they are informative or stressful – do not differ by partisanship. Majorities in both parties say they find they usually have less in common politically when discussing politics with those who have differing views. In both parties, there are ideological differences in views of whether conversations with those they disagree with politically are stressful or not. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 63% of liberals say such conversations are stressful and frustrating, compared with 51% of conservatives and moderates. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, somewhat more conservatives (53%) than moderates and liberals (44%) say it is stressful to discuss politics with those they disagree with. A majority of Americans (63%) say that when they talk about politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought previously. Fewer than a third of Americans (31%) say they find they have more in common with people they disagree with politically. These opinions have changed only modestly since 2016, when 63% said that when discussing politics with people they disagreed with, they had less in common than they thought. There is little division across the partisan and ideological spectrum: More than six-in-ten in each group say they find that when they discuss politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought. Currently, a majority (62%) of Americans say Donald Trump’s presidency and policies come up very often (25%) or somewhat often (37%) in conversation. Far fewer (38%) say Trump comes up not too often or not at all often. That is similar to people’s views of how often Trump came up in conversation in December 2016, shortly after his presidential victory. At that time, 25% said Trump’s election and plans for his presidency came up in conversations very often, while 40% said they were topics somewhat often. As was the case in late 2016, Trump is a more frequent topic of conversation for liberal Democrats than for other Democrats or among Republicans. Currently, 42% of liberal Democrats say Trump’s presidency comes up in conversations very often; that is double the share of conservatives and moderates who say this. Among Republicans, Trump comes up more in conversation among conservatives (23% very often) than among GOP moderates and liberals (15%). The share of conservative Republicans who say Trump comes up very often in conversation has slipped since 2016, from 30% then to 23% now.

---split---8.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/world/canada/canada-trade-midterms.html---split---Supported by By Ian Austen OTTAWA — Canadians will closely watch the fate of a newly negotiated trade pact, analysts said, after the American midterm elections brought Democrats to power in the House and injected a new element of uncertainty in trade relations. Polls show that President Trump is widely unpopular among Canadians, experts noted, so the results may have given a measure of satisfaction to some. “They’re going to be happy that this is a bit of a slap in the face of this president,” said Dane Rowlands, director of the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa. But while many Canadians didn’t like Mr. Trump’s negotiating tactics and some aspects of the new trade accord, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, there is a broad consensus that it is better than not having a deal at all with the United States, Canada’s largest export market. Just the possibility that the Democrats may stall its ratification in Congress could discourage potential investors in Canada, some fear. “We’re going to see a reintroduction of uncertainty surrounding trade,” said Kim Richard Nossal, the director of the Center for International and Defense Policy at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Professor Nossal is among those who expect that the Democrats will take every opportunity to thwart Mr. Trump’s agenda, an effort he believes will include stalling or blocking the new trade deal. Professor Rowlands doesn’t share that view. While he believes that House Democrats will do their best to block the president, Professor Rowlands said he does not anticipate that the trade pact will become part of that effort. “It’s not clear that the Democrats would want to die on that hill partly because approving it avoids the difficult question of what else to do,” Professor Rowlands said. Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat based in Washington who is now vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said that because American unions are pleased with several parts of the U.S.M.C.A., the Democrats are not likely to block the agreement. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] Canadians will also closely watch the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed this year on steel and aluminum exports to the United States. Many Canadians were offended Mr. Trump had argued that the Canadian products were a threat to Americans’ national security. And while Mr. Trump made comments suggesting that the tariffs would be lifted once the previous trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was renegotiated, that has not happened. Congress does not have direct control over tariffs, so it is unclear whether the Democrats could influence them. But the change in congressional power could effect climate change policy and environmental law. When Mr. Trudeau came to office in 2015, he made climate change one of his top priorities and swiftly moved to work with the Obama administration on the subject. Mr. Trump has since unwound many of those measures. Mr. Trudeau is now working to keep Canada’s national carbon pricing program intact after some provinces refused to participate or withdrew from it. Critics argue that taxes on emissions from Canadian industries put them at a competitive disadvantage with their American counterparts, though Mr. Trudeau’s system makes allowances to prevent that. It’s likely, Professor Rowlands said, that the House will fight any further environmental rollbacks by the Trump administration. Still, he said, he doubted it would be able to reverse the many significant changes it has made to date. “The view here is that the House will be able to contain some of the things the administration has done that, from a Canadian perspective, have been a disaster,” he said.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/2018-midterms-illustrate-two-electorates---split---The 2018 midterm showed the divided electorate with its divided outcome. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) It’s rare that both parties can celebrate after an election, but that’s exactly the situation after Republicans gained a handful of Senate seats and Democrats picked up around 30 House seats Tuesday night. Conservatives, white men (particularly those without a college degree) and pro-Trump voters backed GOP nominees, while women (particularly those with a college degree), minorities and younger voters lined up overwhelmingly behind the Democrats. That translated into a good night for Republicans in the Senate and for Democrats in the House. Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Bill Nelson of Florida and Claire McCaskill of Missouri were all defeated, while the re-election bid of Montana’s Jon Tester is still too close to call. Only one Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, lost his seat. Those Republican gains could well be significant for 2020, since they give the party a bit of a cushion in two years, when more competitive Republican Senate seats than Democratic Senate seats are up. Democrat Joe Manchin III of West Virginia bucked the Senate GOP tide, but only narrowly. Over in the House, the blue wave was undeniable. Republican pragmatists representing swing suburban, politically moderate districts went down to defeat, while a handful of long-shot Democrats — in Oklahoma’s 5th District, New York’s 11th District and Illinois’s 14th District — upset heavily favored Republicans. Clearly, the House (and Senate) elections were nationalized. Democrats scored particularly well in congressional races in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and California. That will rob the GOP of politically astute incumbents like Barbara Comstock (Virginia), Mike Coffman (Colorado), Peter Roskam (Illinois), Erik Paulsen (Minnesota), Leonard Lance (New Jersey) and Pete Sessions (Texas), who could not survive the toxic Trump brand in their districts. Governors races were a bit of a mixed bag for the parties. Republicans won the important Florida and Ohio contests, while Democrats flipped seats to get elected to the states’ top offices in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan. In addition, Trump ally and immigration hardliner Kris Kobach, the GOP nominee in Kansas, lost his bid for governor. Democrats will net about a half a dozen governorships, an unsurprising result given the large number Republicans already held. For some Democrats and those in the national media, Democratic defeats in the Florida Senate and gubernatorial races, the Texas Senate race and the Georgia governor’s race obviously were deflating. Those were high profile, symbolic contests, but they were always difficult races for the Democrats. The broader takeaway is that the midterms confirmed what everyone knew — that the country is split in two, with very red Trump states and a growing anti-Trump, blue electorate centered in upscale suburbs. According to exit polling, men went Republican by 51 percent to 48 percent, while women voted Democratic by 20 points, 59 percent to 39 percent. Younger voters ages 18-29 voted Democratic by 36 points, and voters 30-44 went Democratic by 21 points. On the other hand, voters 45 and older split almost evenly between the two parties. Whites went Republican by 9 points (54 percent to 45 percent), while nonwhites and Latinos went overwhelmingly Democratic. White women actually went Democratic narrowly (50 percent to 48 percent), while white men went Republican by a resounding 20 points, 59 percent to 39 percent. White college graduates went solidly Democratic by 10 points, while whites without a college degree went Republican 60 percent to 38 percent. The national electorate was 37 percent Democratic/33 percent Republican, reflecting strong Democratic enthusiasm and turnout in a midterm election, when Republicans often have an advantage. Interestingly, independents went Democratic by 12 points, 54 percent to 42 percent. The House “generic ballot” question in the exit poll gave Democrats an 8-point advantage, about what the better national pre-election polls showed. First-time voters, who constituted 16 percent of the electorate, went Democratic by a stunning 62 percent to 35 percent. White evangelicals once again stuck with the GOP. Three-quarters of those voters went Republican, while two-thirds of non-evangelicals voted for Democrats. Only 44 percent of midterm voters approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. The question is now how Washington, D.C., functions with the new partisan realities. While some observers have suggested that the president could now reach out to Democrats with an offer of pragmatism (on infrastructure, for example), Democrats are likely to be skeptical, especially since the party’s base is not in any mood to work with the Trump White House. Moreover, the 2020 presidential race is already underway, and that almost guarantees partisan maneuvering and rhetoric will raise the temperature in the nation’s capital. The investigation by Robert S. Mueller III could also become more visible, leading the president to punch back. The GOP’s success in the midterm’s Senate races is likely to convince Trump that confrontation turned out Republican voters and produced additional Senate gains during the midterms. That should only encourage the president and party strategists to heat up the rhetoric, not tone it down, during Trump’s re-election effort. Republicans won a seat or two more than expected in the Senate, and there were a few stunning Democratic upset victories in the House. But overall, election night went generally as expected, with Democrats winning back the House and the Senate map helping Republicans expand their Senate majority. Those election results confirm the deep division in the country, as well as the passion felt on both sides. That is not a formula for cooperation, consensus, legislative success or measured rhetoric.

EPA-EFE/BASTIAAN SLABBERS ORG XMIT: BS100 (Photo: BASTIAAN SLABBERS, EPA-EFE) If the big rally on Wall Street after the midterm elections is any guide, gridlock is good for stocks. U.S. equities jumped sharply higher Wednesday after the midterm elections set the stage for a newly divided Congress, an outcome that eased fears about a big change in policy that could hurt corporate profitability. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied more than 545 points, or 2.1 percent, to 26,180, boosting its gain for the year to 5.9 percent and leaving it just 2.4 percent shy of its October record high. The rally was broad, with the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rising 2.1 percent and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite gaining 2.6 percent. Wall Street woke up to a partisan power split in Congress and a likely period of legislative gridlock after the Democrats regained control of the House, ending two years of Republican control of both branches of Congress under Republican President Donald Trump. The GOP retained its majority in the Senate. The vote result, however, was widely expected by investors. The new Capitol Hill alignment that will take effect in January isn't viewed as a major game-changer for the economy or markets, largely because the split Congress makes it unlikely that legislation would undo parts of President Trump's agenda – such as large tax cuts and deregulation of business. Investors also avoided the most-feared Wall Street outcome, a so-called "blue wave," or Democratic sweep of both chambers of Congress. That could have put the president's economic policies under assault and boosted the odds of a Democratic House pushing for Trump's impeachment. "Everything played out according to script," Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at Oanda, told USA TODAY. "The Trump agenda is not in serious jeopardy." Still, the House will likely make things tough on Trump and move to block his agenda, adds Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com "House Democrats will turn up the pressure on President Trump through investigations and oversight," Hamrick said. Legislative gridlock has historically been good for financial markets. In fact, in years with a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-run House in place, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has posted average gains of 10.8 percent, according to data from Strategas Research Partners. "A split Congress means that gridlock is more likely, and that's been fine for markets in the past," says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. In the past, after the uncertainty around the midterm elections has been eliminated after the vote, stocks have performed well, posting higher returns a year after every midterm election since World War II. The Dow also has posted average gains of 4 percent in the fourth quarter of midterm election years going back to 1896, data from LPL Research show. A Democrat-controlled Congress would have been greeted less well by investors, as it would have increased concerns about the possible rollback of Trump-driven policies, adds David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. "The outcome of the elections was not a tail risk event," Joy says, referring to a surprise outcome similar to the Brexit vote in 2016 that rocked markets. "The markets were afraid there would be a blue wave, which would have resulted in a government that was perceived as less business friendly." The stock market also tends to rise once the uncertainty of the election is out of the way, allowing investors to return their focus to things such as the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, adds Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. "The unknown is behind us," Quinlan says. "There were no surprises so investors can refocus on business fundamentals, which are solid and supportive of rising equity prices." Wall Street's focus now will shift to existing headwinds, such as U.S. and China trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike plans, Quinlan says. Political gridlock, Quinlan adds, could result in less fiscal stimulus from the federal government, which means there is "less risk" of the U.S. economy overheating, which could lead to less aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/here-come-subpoenas-what-house-democrats-plan-their-russia-probe-n933681---split---WASHINGTON — When Democrats assume control of the House of Representatives in January, President Donald Trump will face something he has never before experienced: An opposition party with subpoena power whose goal is to make public every detail of the 2016 Russian election interference effort. That fact became even more consequential Wednesday, when Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The departure of Sessions places the acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump conspired with Russia. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who previously was in charge, was in that role only because Sessions had recused himself, citing his role in the Trump campaign. Now, Whitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff, takes the reins. Before he joined the government, he repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe, saying, for example, that Mueller should not investigate Trump's finances. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have not explicitly said they would re-open the committee's Russia investigation, which was closed in March by the Republicans in charge of the committee. But they have said there are many additional questions they would like to answer. Republicans announced they had found no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia; Democrats proclaimed that a laughable whitewash. They noted that the committee had allowed Steve Bannon to dodge questions, had failed to demand relevant documents from the Trump campaign, and had not heard from key witnesses. "We're certainly going to look at the work that we were able to do, we're going to look at the work that the GOP obstructed on our committee," Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who will chair the committee in January, said on MSNBC. "We'll have to see what Bob Mueller has been able to do and what Bob Mueller has been able to say, either via indictment or via report, and that will also guide what we intend to do in our committee." On Wednesday, after Sessions stepped down, Schiff tweeted that "the Mueller investigation and the independence of the DOJ must be protected." But regardless of how aggressively Schiff's committee moves to re-open its own investigation, the committee also plays another important role: Overseeing the executive branch and releasing its findings to the public. Mueller is conducting a criminal investigation, using a grand jury that is bound by secrecy rules. He is supposed to prepare a report on his findings, but there is nothing that says that report must be made public. The report would go to Whitaker, who could decide to stick it in a drawer. But House Democrats could use their subpoena power to try to force the Trump administration to turn it over. They could also seek to compel witnesses to testify under oath — including, in theory, Mueller himself — about what they have found. How much of that testimony could unfold in public would depend on how much information was classified. There is also an issue of grand jury secrecy. But there is little doubt that Democrats would seek to expose Mueller's findings, and Tuesday's election results give them the power to do so. "We are immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction," said Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has been continuing to conduct its own Russia investigation, despite the House Republican findings. The Senate probe is led by a Republican, Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr, who has said he will not run for-reelection, has not sought to protect the president at all costs, but he has also expressed skepticism about some lines of inquiry. The ranking Democrat, Virginia's Mark Warner, has been required to compromise on scope and investigative efforts to keep Burr on board, people involved have said. House Democrats will not have to compromise — they have all the power in their chamber. "We will conduct the investigations that Republicans won't," Intelligence Committee member Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said on TODAY. "We'll fill in the gaps on the Russia investigations. The American people will see his tax returns, not because of voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt." Schiff hasn't said exactly what more he would like to investigate, but he did detail what he recommended the committee do before Republicans closed the investigation in March. Among the steps he said Democrats were blocked from taking: Another witness House Democrats want to talk to is Randy Credico, a longtime friend of Trump adviser Roger Stone, who is alleged to have been Stone's backchannel to WikiLeaks, which released hacked Democratic emails prior to the 2016 election. Credico is ready, he told NBC News Wednesday. "I'm not afraid to talk now and I would probably appear this time," Credico said. "I would be open this time around to speak to the House.... I've certainly held back a lot of the stuff I know about Stone for a while. It might be a good time to air it out. As the president says, 'Let's see what happens.'"

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/briefing/sessions-election-results-amazon.html---split---Supported by By Jean Rutter, Albert Sun and Marcus Payadue (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The realignment of power in Congress. Voter fury toward President Trump lifted Democrats into control of the House of Representatives, ending two years of single-party dominance. Some districts hit by retaliatory tariffs switched to Democratic candidates from Republican incumbents. See what the blue wave looked like. Republicans held their Senate majority and gained at least two seats. Voter turnout was unusually high — we’re still gathering the data on that. Voters approved Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska by comfortable margins. Climate initiatives, though, earned mixed results. Among the historic firsts: the election of Muslim and Native American women. Catch up on the results from the House, the Senate and for governorships and other state positions. _____ 2. The new Democratic majority in the House sets up the likelihood of two years of intense conflict with President Trump. Our chief Washington correspondent says the big topics they are likely to wrangle over are health care, investigating Mr. Trump, bipartisan efforts on drug pricing and public infrastructure, and appealing to millennials. For his part, Mr. Trump may have to choose between escalating the partisan warfare in Washington or trying to reach across the aisle. Mr. Trump pledged bipartisan cooperation and even praised Nancy Pelosi, whose return as House speaker is looking increasingly likely. But he also promised to adopt “a warlike posture” if Congress investigated his political and financial dealings, and renewed his attack on reporters. Above, a heated exchange at a news conference. _____ 3. “Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation.” With much of the country mulling over the election results, President Trump made a high-profile ouster: Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He became a frequent and public target of the president after he recused himself from investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff and a Trump loyalist, will step into the gap, as acting attorney general — and will oversee the Russia investigation, whose scope he has questioned as verging on a “witch hunt.” Read our profile of Mr. Whitaker, written in September, when Mr. Sessions’s resignation appeared imminent. Will Mr. Trump meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at a lunch for world leaders in Paris on Sunday? The messaging has been contradictory. _____ 4. A few details are emerging about Amazon’s near-deal to split its second headquarters between Long Island City in Queens, above, and Crystal City, Va., but there is a lot we still don’t know. Specifics about locations and construction plans are blurry. Also unknown: how much state and local governments have offered in tax incentives and other benefits. What seems clear is this: Cities with high-skilled workers and other prosperous companies will continue to attract more of them. A formal announcement could come shortly — if only to clear the way for the holiday season, when Amazon wants its headlines to be about shopping, not its buildings. _____ 5. U.S. aviation regulators ordered an emergency revision in the manual for the new Boeing 737 Max 8 to help crews react if the plane nose-dives because of faulty flight sensor data — a possible contributor to the fatal crash in Indonesia last week. Investigators looking into the deadly crash of a new Boeing 737 Max 8 jet last week have determined that its angle-of-attack sensors — instruments that gauge the degree of the plane’s ascent or descent — gave faulty readings. Above, investigating the engine. Boeing revealed that in a statement, adding that it had issued a global alert to airlines on how pilots can reclaim manual control. Sensors on the Lion Air jet had been worked on a day before the crash, which killed all 189 people aboard. _____ 6. The most powerful figure in Italy’s populist government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, above, has pushed his image as a law and order tough guy, cracking down on immigration, declaring a war on drugs and creating a sense of public safety emergency. And he’s trying to import American-style gun culture. While campaigning earlier this year Mr. Salvini, above, signed a cooperation pledge with a group advocating looser gun laws, and in September they notched a victory when the government made it possible to own more guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15. Italy’s gun lobby doesn’t have the clout the N.R.A. wields in the U.S., but it is growing. _____ 7. More than 300,000 flickering clay lamps were lighted in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya for the Hindu festival of Diwali. They’re reflected in the Sarayu River, considered sacred in the Hindu religion. The holiday, also known as the festival of light, coincides with the Hindu new year and is a celebration of new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil. The 300,150 oil lamps broke a Guinness world record when they burned simultaneously for more than five minutes. Strong wind foiled the city’s attempt to break the record last year. _____ 8. Beatboxers use tongue, throat, lips and breath to produce sounds that can resemble an entire band’s worth of instruments. Scientists who study language hoped to observe how the sounds people intend to make are reflected in the way they shape their vocal tract. So they asked five beatboxers to perform in an M.R.I. scanner. Above, an image from the research. The video is fascinating. _____ 9. “We need more weed!” Three weeks after Canada legalized marijuana, some dispensary shelves are empty. The shortage is evidence of unexpectedly high demand, driven not only by novelty, experts say, but also by the desirability of government-regulated cannabis — it’s contaminant-free. Above, in Vancouver. The shortage threatens to undermine a major aim of legalization: to tame an illegal marijuana trade estimated at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars annually. Some pot smokers say illegal dealers are seizing the moment, hawking home delivery services and lowering prices. _____ 10. Finally, an amazing discovery in a cave in Borneo. In a newly published paper, scientists say the image above of a four-legged animal found there was created more than 40,000 years ago, making it the earliest figurative art in the world. The age was determined with a new technique that analyzes the radioactive decay of uranium in flowstone, a translucent mineral deposited by water trickling down cave walls. Earlier known art is abstract, like patterns of lines. And figurative art almost as old has been found in Europe, demonstrating that humans around the world made the transition independently, and at roughly the same time. Have a creative evening.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/business/dealbook/midterm-results-business.html---split---Supported by Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Democrats have reclaimed the House, while Republicans extended control in the Senate. That spells gridlock — and investors are fine with it. As Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, told CNBC, “History has shown that the mixed party control is generally the best combination.” U.S. market futures were up slightly this morning, as were international stock indexes. The dollar declined, partly on the diminished prospect of further economic stimulus like another tax cut. Michael McKenzie of the FT says that the trend could continue, as “the election result seems likely to produce a softer dollar and steady bond yields, which will help” the markets. Now, investors will turn their attention to other issues, including the Fed’s monetary policy and the U.S.-China trade battle. Now that Democrats control the House, they will start trying to curb President Trump’s agenda. Less clear is what they can achieve. First on the agenda is likely to be an array of investigations. Politico notes that Democratic lawmakers already have a list of subpoenas and document requests. Other officials, like New York State’s new attorney general, have pledged to investigate Mr. Trump’s business dealings and, potentially, his tax returns. House Democrats will also have more power to stymie Mr. Trump. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is expected to retake the speakership, while outspoken critics of the administration like Representative Maxine Waters, a skeptic of banking deregulation, are set to assume control of major committees. But there are limits. Democrats cannot force an end to Mr. Trump’s trade fight with China, nor can they block judicial nominees. And Ms. Pelosi is unlikely to pursue impeachment proceedings. They are likely to work with the president on infrastructure spending and lower drug prices. “Everybody understands that we have to choose our battles very carefully now,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, told the NYT. So far, Quartz noted, the elections have led to: • More than 100 women in the House • The first Muslim women in Congress • The first Native American women in Congress • The youngest women in Congress • The first openly gay person elected as governor But Bloomberg argues that such records are important only if the new officials can stay long enough to effect real change. For now, election officials and social media companies are breathing a sigh of relief. At a news conference yesterday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said there was “no indication of compromise to our nation’s election infrastructure that would prevent voting, change vote counts or distrust the ability to tally votes.” Facebook said that it had shut down more accounts that it believed were spreading misinformation. It also said it had acted against some inaccurate voting information. (Accounts shut down on Monday are said to have been linked to a Kremlin-backed group of internet trolls.) But in general, the day bore no huge drama: “We haven’t seen anything unexpected,” a Facebook representative told the BBC. But reports of meddling could yet come to light. “I remain convinced that the real action will be after the election when we start to see the voter fraud, hacking claims start to roll in,” Bret Schafer of the Alliance for Securing Democracy told the BBC. More: How Amazon might make a push into securing elections. The nation had been waiting to see if the midterm elections would dramatically weaken President Trump and help ease geopolitical tensions. But Democratic control of the House looks to give Beijing only a marginal increase in negotiating leverage. The results are unlikely to soften the U.S.-China trade war. Speaking at Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum in Singapore this week, Gary Cohn, President Trump’s former economic adviser, said: “I wish that I could sit here and say, ‘After the midterm elections, the White House and the administration understand they’ve got to solve trade issues.’” But, he added, “I don’t think there’s an instant cure.” China and Australia talk trade. Marise Payne is the first Australian foreign minister to visit Beijing in almost three years. She is to meet with her counterpart, Wang Yi, and plans to focus the conversation on trade and human rights. Financial markets are closed in India until Friday. The country is celebrating the Diwali holiday. The company’s plan to split its second headquarters between two sites drew complaints that it acted in bad faith. But Amazon probably won’t mind. John Gapper of the FT says that Amazon’s tactic of looking at smaller cities was “an elaborate charade.” And Robert Engel of the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, a frequent critic of the company, told the NYT, “They’ve duped all of us.” The quest has gotten Amazon both lots of publicity and the offer of some fantastic financial benefits. But it may have gained something even more valuable, as David Streitfeld of the NYT notes: “It’s tempting to roll your eyes at this soap opera, but Amazon will walk away from this stunt with a cache of incredibly valuable data,” said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent Amazon critic. “It’s learned all kinds of things from the bidding cities — like their future infrastructure plans — that even their citizens are not privy to.” More Amazon news: How New York and Virginia are preparing for their new tenant. And losers in the HQ2 search are still holding out hope. Delivering profits to shareholders may no longer be enough. Reflecting on last week’s DealBook conference, Andrew explains that executives have long liked to talk about their role in society, but all too often their promises rang hollow. Now, things seem to be changing: As our society appears more polarized than ever, and as Washington seems in no hurry to heal this divided country, executives are finding themselves in the unwanted position of trying to play the role of uniter — or in some cases, picking sides. Also from the conference: Business leaders describe the breakthrough moments in their careers. U.S. crude prices fell 19 percent in October, after hitting a four-year high of $76 a barrel earlier in the month. Any further drop could end the biggest oil-market bull run since 2008. Here’s more from Stephanie Yang and Amrith Ramkumar of the WSJ: The market started losing steam last month as falling U.S. stocks dragged down oil prices and raised doubts over the health of the global economy. Meanwhile, the world’s three largest oil producers have increased output to record levels. “All of this is combining to create way too much supply,” said Gary Ross, chief executive of Black Gold Investors and founder of PIRA Energy Group. With supply expected to be plentiful, there’s little reason to believe prices will rise again soon. That may be bad news for producers, but it’s a relief to consumers and airlines. Javier Soltero of Microsoft, who most recently oversaw the company’s Cortana A.I. assistant, is leaving. Alexander Friedman resigned as C.E.O. of GAM, the Swiss money manager. Ole Andersen was ousted as Danske Bank’s chairman. Walt Disney’s deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox may have scrambled succession planning for its C.E.O., Bob Iger.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/conservatives-senate-judges-abortion.html---split---Supported by By Jeremy W. Peters and Elizabeth Dias WASHINGTON — Republican victories in crucial Senate and governors’ races this week have tightened social conservatives’ grip across American government, strengthening the party’s power as it seeks to limit abortion rights and push harder to the right on a number of divisive cultural issues. Even as Democrats captured the House and promised to act as a check on President Trump and Republican policy priorities, conservatives were breathing a deep sigh of relief on Wednesday after strengthening their majority in the Senate. Their gains in the upper chamber could have a far-reaching impact on the remainder of the president’s term, particularly on his ability to continue shifting the ideological balance on the federal courts. The election of conservatives to Democratic-held Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota — as well as to an open seat in Tennessee, and possibly in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi, where races have not been decided — will almost certainly add to the Republicans’ one-seat majority. It will also dilute the votes of moderate Republicans like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom are abortion rights supporters who have opposed judges on the grounds that they could threaten Roe v. Wade. President Trump, who has already filled vacancies on the federal bench at a faster pace than most previous presidents, and cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court with two appointments so far, is now in a stronger position to put forward even more conservative judicial nominees if he chooses to. In taking stock of conservatives’ gains in the Senate on Wednesday morning — a bright spot in an election in which the Republicans lost their hold on many moderate suburban districts and seven governorships — Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, vowed to continue pressing ahead with the confirmation of judges. From the South to Appalachia to the Great Plains, high turnout among evangelical Christians translated into wins for social and religious conservatives as well as anti-abortion ballot measures, demonstrating the potency of a different kind of culture war issue in the midterm elections — one that had nothing to do with immigration or caravans or the politics of grievance and revenge that President Trump campaigned on so aggressively. In Iowa, voters re-elected a governor who signed a bill this year that sought to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat could be detected — a move intended to provoke a legal challenge to Roe at the Supreme Court. (A federal court later put the law on hold.) The newly elected Republican governors in Florida and Ohio are opponents of abortion rights and defeated candidates who supported protecting Roe. In West Virginia and Alabama, voters approved ballot initiatives that would essentially ban abortion, and one that even gives rights to a fetus, in the event that a new constitutional challenge to Roe succeeds at the Supreme Court — an outcome that activists on both sides of the debate believe is possible since the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh tilted the court decidedly to the right. In the North Dakota Senate race — one of three in which Republicans prevailed by defeating a Democratic incumbent who supported abortion rights — the winner, Representative Kevin Cramer, had cut an ad against late-term abortions featuring his pregnant daughter and brought his newborn grandchild onstage for his victory speech. In Missouri, the day before the election, Senator Claire McCaskill endorsed the Hyde Amendment — which bars federal programs like Medicaid from paying for most abortions — but it appeared too late to convince many voters, and she was defeated. Social conservatives said on Wednesday they were elated by the victories in the Senate and in the governors’ races, which they believe provide openings to push their agenda in the judiciary and the states even if a Democratic-led House ties up legislative priorities of President Trump and Washington Republicans. “We are so much stronger than we were before,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group that led an extensive turnout operation this year in states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri, where incumbent Democratic senators were defeated by anti-abortion Republicans. “We win when we go back to our roots,” she added. Having more anti-abortion governors in states that have previously advanced anti-abortion legislation, and a stronger anti-abortion majority in the Senate, also means that activist groups can focus their spending on the president’s re-election in 2020, instead of pouring money primarily into preserving or building a Republican Senate. “The anti-choice movement is putting all of the pieces together they believe need to be in place to end legal abortion,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America. “The Republican Party has next to no rank and file left except for the extreme anti-choice movement and the white nationalist movement, who don’t knock doors that much.” Abortion rights advocates point to significant victories on Tuesday: There are new Democratic representatives in the House who will replace Republicans who oppose reproductive health rights, and new governors in four states — Nevada, Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan — all of whom favor abortion rights. “Legislatively defunding Planned Parenthood is off the table,” said Andrew Taverrite, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “Voters from every political party sent a clear message last night: They want more access to health care, not less.” But even if federal legislation is no longer an option to anti-abortion activists, the courts are where the biggest battles ahead most likely lie. And while Republicans will not be in the majority in the House, the hard-line Freedom Caucus is expected to wield more influence inside the Republican conference because there will be fewer moderate Republicans in that chamber. “Conservatives won last night,” said David McIntosh, a former House member and president of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative advocacy group. “Had Republicans all run that way, arguably we could have kept the House.” The Faith & Freedom Coalition, the Christian conservative group founded by Ralph Reed, which had an extensive ground game this cycle, found in its data that evangelicals made up more than a quarter of the midterm electorate, and about 80 percent of them voted Republican. In 2016, 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump. Evangelicals will also be “indispensable to Trump’s re-election prospects in 2020,” said Mr. Reed, “in what promises to be the mother of all turnout battles.” Mr. Trump ingratiated himself to white evangelicals by promising, and delivering, their biggest policy priorities — none more important than the naming of two conservative Supreme Court justices who had the approval of anti-abortion groups. For now, staying loyal to Mr. Trump remains a winning strategy for evangelical leaders. Ron Johnson, the pastor of Living Stones Church in northwest Indiana, who urged his congregation to support the “no brainer” choice of Mike Braun for Senate on Sunday, said he was “thrilled” with Tuesday’s results. “We believe in good and evil, in God, in his agenda,” he said. “I honestly believe that everything the pro-choice movement was founded on is running out of gas.” Activists see the potential for strengthening their base even more in 2020. Last Sunday, Brent Burnett, a congregant at Mr. Johnson’s church, said he did not vote for Mr. Trump two years ago, citing concerns over his character. But now, “he’s kept his word” on the issues most important to him, Mr. Burnett said, from abortion to the economy. “I’d definitely vote for him next time,” he said.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/california-midterm-results-central-valley-modesto.html---split---Supported by Big swaths of the Golden State remain conservative, and changing the political fabric and voting patterns of a community takes more than one election. By Miriam Pawel Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of “The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.” TURLOCK, Calif. — It started so small. Twenty people in Crystal Sousa’s living room, traumatized by the election of Donald Trump, trying to channel desperation into constructive action. Be the Change, they called the group that coalesced in this small, conservative city in the Central Valley of California. Almost all the leaders were women. Most had never engaged in politics. But they had been PTA mothers, Girl Scout leaders and teachers. They knew how to get things done. Last weekend, almost two years after she hosted her first house party, Ms. Sousa stood on a flatbed truck dispatching wave after wave of volunteers to knock on voters’ doors. So many hundreds of canvassers showed up that teams were sent back to revisit houses where no one had been home the first time. Their message was straightforward: The four-term incumbent, Representative Jeff Denham, was an ally of President Trump, loyal only to the Republican Party, betraying the interests of the people of the 10th Congressional District. Whether their argument proved persuasive enough may not be clear for days. On Wednesday, Mr. Denham was holding a slim lead over his Democratic challenger, Josh Harder, with many votes uncounted, including provisional ballots cast on Election Day and mail-in votes still in transit. Even absent results, Mr. Harder cast his campaign as part of the Democrats’ larger success in retaking the House. “Our real opponent was not somebody else on the ballot,” he said. “It was apathy and cynicism.” A 32-year-old political novice who grew up in Turlock, Mr. Harder put together an old-fashioned campaign that drew on lessons from recent Democratic victories: Underdogs can topple incumbents only by organizing, not for months but for years, not after a candidate is chosen but before, not just by demonizing President Trump but by tying Republicans to issues that resonate with voters — reduced access to health care, attacks on immigrants. “We knocked on 200,000 doors — 200,000 doors in the last three days!” Mr. Harder said on election night. “That’s insane!’’ And yet, even that, coupled with a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, may not have been enough. The failure to score a clear victory in the 10th District, a scenario repeated in other California districts that Democrats tried to flip, is a reminder that large portions the state remain conservative, incumbents are difficult to dislodge, and changing the political fabric and voting patterns of a community takes more than one election cycle. The California results also suggest that Trump supporters may be more committed than polls detected, and the intense focus on these districts guaranteed they would show up to vote. On paper, Stanislaus County, the bulk of the 10th district, has had a Democratic majority since April 2008. But as in much of California, party registration is not necessarily predictive of voting patterns. In a state that grew up fiercely committed to repudiating political machines, ticket splitting is a given. Stanislaus Republicans have long held a lock on local offices, even as the county has voted, until 2016, for every winning presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972. “California with Southern hospitality and a Southern mind-set” is how Ms. Sousa describes the community where she grew up, a legacy of the long-ago migration of Southern Democrats to the Central Valley. Democrats here historically refrained from advertising their beliefs; there were few lawn signs for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, though each carried the district. That changed after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, in ways that both enlarged and further polarized the electorate. A dozen groups like Be the Change sprung up — Our Revolution, Indivisible Manteca, Patterson Progressive Alliance. The groups came together as the CA 10 Progressive Alliance, united in their determination to flip the district. They reached out to engage the young and disenfranchised. And they registered voters; the total in the district increased 18 percent since the last midterm, almost double the statewide average. As in the rest of California, the biggest increase came in independent voters, whose numbers since the last midterm grew more than 50 percent; they now make up almost a quarter of the district’s voters. That further complicates the political calculus, underscoring the degree to which personal beliefs and connections outweigh party loyalty. Mr. Denham, who won re-election two years ago by less than 4 percent, campaigned on his familiar name and identification as a businessman who shares the district’s values. The words “veteran” and “farmer” figured prominently on his signs. In an agricultural and industrial area where guns are popular and abortion is not, Mr. Denham was outspoken in support of the Second Amendment and in opposition to abortion. He ran a vicious television advertisement that used an out-of-context clip to suggest Mr. Harder supported taxpayer-financed abortions through the ninth month. It will take weeks of analyzing votes that have not even been tallied to determine exactly who voted and how much of the race turned on support or opposition to President Trump versus the contest between Mr. Denham and Mr. Harder. That the Republican may have eked out another win is a testament to the strength of incumbency and the convictions of his conservative base, who vote far more reliably than the new and the disillusioned voters whom the Harder coalition worked to enfranchise. On the issues, Mr. Denham’s alliance with the president increased his vulnerability. Growers have been among Mr. Denham’s core supporters, but Trump policies on immigration and trade have hurt the walnut and almond growers and dairies that are bulwarks of the local economy. The congressman highlighted Mr. Trump’s commitment to help get more water for farms, although the promises have yet to translate to action. And on health care, a key concern for many in a district that relies heavily on Obamacare, Mr. Denham reneged on a promise to vote against cuts in the Affordable Care Act, joining Republicans’ unsuccessful effort to repeal and replace. “There’s an elephant in the race for California’s 10th Congressional District, and Jeff Denham is carrying him on his back,” wrote The Modesto Bee, endorsing Mr. Harder after having supported Mr. Denham in all but one of his previous races. “That orange elephant’s name is Donald.” Mr. Denham’s campaign script sought to distract attention from the issues and sow doubts about the values of the man he only referred to as “Bay Area Harder,” often adding “liberal” as the ultimate pejorative. Like many young people, Mr. Harder had left the valley — in his case to attend Stanford and Harvard and work at a venture capital firm. He was not politically involved and did not even vote until he moved back to Turlock to run for Congress, galvanized by the election of Mr. Trump. In a sense, Mr. Denham was correct that Bay Area liberals posed a threat. Experienced activists came over the Altamont Pass from San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland, weekend after weekend — in previous years, they had gone to help campaigns in Nevada or Arizona — and focused their zealous energy closer to home. “Before, nobody ever thought, ‘Hey, let’s go to the Central Valley,’” said Andrew Kim, field director for Flip the 14 (a reference to the 14 Republican-held districts in the state), which chartered buses. The result was an unheard-of army of volunteers with clipboards and smartphones, traditional one-on-one organizing married with apps that tracked progress in real time. Some volunteers stayed with locals and built relationships that, like the Harder campaign, may lay the groundwork for future change. “This is not just one election,” said Ms. Sousa, a teacher who was recently elected to her school board. The grass-roots groups will continue to meet regularly, regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. “This is going to change the whole make up of our district. It’s been life changing, honestly.” Whatever the outcome in this congressional contest, the Democratic campaign has laid the foundation for much-needed change in a district where fewer than 18 percent of the people have college degrees and 40 percent rely on MediCal, the state’s version of Medicaid. The Harder campaign marked a milestone here in the Central Valley, potentially an inflection point to empower a community badly in need of help. But change doesn’t happen overnight. The last time so many Bay Area activists traveled to the Central Valley was in the 1960s, when they formed the bulwark of early support for Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers’ movement. The strike against grape growers endured five years before the United Farm Workers union finally got its victory.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/midterms-democrats-republicans-results.html---split---Supported by The midterms offered some painful lessons for Democrats. By Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist In the end it was only a blue ripple, and that should prompt soul-searching among Democrats — particularly as everyone looks ahead to 2020. Don’t listen to Democrats who portray these midterms as an important triumph. In 2016 and again this year, liberals listened too much to one another and not enough to the country as a whole; if that happens again in the run-up to 2020, heaven help us all. President Trump was wildly exaggerating when he tweeted that the election was a “Big Win” for him, but he did O.K. by historical standards. Democrats won the House but lost seats in the Senate; in the 39 midterm elections since 1862, the president’s party had lost Senate seats 24 times and House seats 35 times. It’s great that for the first time, at least 100 women will serve in the House. But of the three highest-profile Democratic candidates who were repositories of the party’s hopes — Beto O’Rourke, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum — not a single one won. Yes, the margins were narrow. But while it’s fine to make excuses, it’s better to win elections. To actually govern, and to get their way with judicial appointments, Democrats must also control the Senate and win statewide elections in states like Arizona, Florida, Indiana and Missouri. That is possible but will require more than bravado. President Trump’s dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday underscores the point. The expanded G.O.P. presence in the Senate will make it easier for Trump to confirm a new attorney general and undermine the Robert Mueller investigation. So what lessons can be learned? As Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns noted in The Times, “The candidates who delivered the House majority largely hailed from the political center, running on clean-government themes and promises of incremental improvement to the health care system rather than transformational social change.” [For exclusive commentary on human rights, women’s rights and global affairs, sign up for Nicholas Kristof’s newsletter.] Every time Democrats mentioned the word “impeachment” or talked about abolishing ICE, Republicans benefited. The Democrats’ mishandling of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination was a gift to Republican candidates, for Senators Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp all lost re-election bids after opposing Kavanaugh. I don’t think Democrats should have voted for Kavanaugh. I do think they should have paid more attention to how their posturing played across the country. Senator Cory Booker’s “Spartacus moment” thrilled some Democrats but hurt the party. That’s a risk going forward: Democrats jockeying for the presidential nomination in 2020 will tug the party toward impeachment talk or a blizzard of subpoenas — in ways that may help Trump. I fear that America’s polarization will worsen in the next couple of years, with increased hate and perhaps violence, and I understand Democrats’ fury at Trump’s role in this. But a spitting rage on the left simply empowers him. One lesson from the midterms is that a nominee like Senator Elizabeth Warren might increase the odds of Trump’s re-election. A nominee from beyond the Beltway with experience running things, like Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, or the departing Colorado governor, John Hickenlooper, might be a better bet. Or, among senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio or Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota might have a good shot at winning swing states. And if, as expected, Democrats in the House pick Nancy Pelosi to be speaker, that will be a postelection gift to the Republican Party. That’s unfair but true. Democrats should look at referendum results as a glimpse of a road map forward. Three conservative states — Utah, Nebraska and Idaho — appear to have voted to expand Medicaid. Two other conservative states, Arkansas and Missouri, raised the minimum wage. And Florida restored voting rights to most people who have completed sentences after felony convictions. Those outcomes suggest a focus not on “resistance” as such, but on practical ways to improve lives. Swing voters agree with many progressive ideas, from jobs to health care to higher taxes on the wealthy, but Democrats have a knack for antagonizing the working class by coming off as condescending, angry elitists. Democratic leaders understand this and are saying the right things about emphasizing health care costs, infrastructure improvement and cleaning up politics. By all means, stand up to Trump when he demonizes immigrants or separates families, but pick your battles. One problem: Many Democrats live in an urban blue bubble, without a single Trump-supporting friend. Ever since the 2016 election, a progressive wing has tarred all Trump voters as racists, idiots and bigots. Not surprisingly, it’s difficult to win votes from people you’re calling bigots. So a plea: It’s gratifying to give heroic speeches thundering against fascism, but remember that what makes a difference in people’s lives is winning elections, passing laws and approving judges. To do that, Democrats must engage in less fist-waving and more listening. Nicholas Kristof has been a columnist for The Times since 2001.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking---split---The Federal Reserve appears ready to make another tweak that will slow the rise of a key short-term interest rate by the end of the year, analysts say. Fed officials have signaled they are likely to leave interest rates unchanged at their policy meeting Nov. 7-8, but still expect to lift rates gradually through next year and into 2020. This week’s Fed meeting is expected to be a snoozer, devoid of any prospect of an interest-rate change. It also may be the last time the central bank gets to have one of these expectations-free gatherings. While a divided Congress heralds more partisan bickering, it doesn’t necessarily signal a change in the Trump administration’s push to ease rules for banks. The European Central Bank said it had nominated Italian economist Andrea Enria as the region’s top banking supervisor amid renewed investor scrutiny of Italian lenders. People’s Bank of China Gov. Yi Gang admitted that previous efforts to rein in debt had exacerbated companies’ financing challenges. China’s foreign-exchange reserves saw its biggest monthly drop in October in nearly two years, as a strong U.S. dollar hurt the value of other holdings and likely prompted government intervention to shore up the yuan.   A VoxEU column studies whether older Americans stop working due to a lack of interest or due to a lack of opportunity, and finds that it may be the latter. Effective corporate profit tax rates in the U.S. were “already relatively low” before the tax cut, and they “are now even lower,” Matthew Higgins writes in a New York Fed Liberty Street Economics post. Unconventional policy tools deployed by the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan in recent years were effective, according to research from economists at the International Monetary Fund. There’s no evidence that aiming for 2% does any good, and it could do real economic harm. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has reasons for optimism that the rosy U.S. jobs picture can go on indefinitely, Greg Ip writes. Rising wages, long a nagging problem for U.S. companies, are becoming a more acute one. Explore how Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spends his days by searching his calendar entries.

Flip through 1,605 pages of transcripts of the Fed’s 2010 policy meetings or search by key people or topics the officials discussed. How central banks in four major economies have moved two key levers of monetary policy in recent years, and how economic indicators have responded. The Treasury’s auction of $19 billion of 30-year bonds met the weakest demand since 2009, a sign the flood of new U.S. government debt requires higher yields to attract investors. Unfilled jobs in the U.S. exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by more than one million as the summer came to a close, a sign it is increasingly difficult for employers to find workers. Facing one of the tightest labor markets in the U.S., Foxconn has been trying to tap Chinese engineers through internal transfers to supplement staffing for its planned Wisconsin plant, according to people familiar with the matter. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China could benefit other Asian economies and markets, according to analysts with an alternative take on the impact of rising tariffs across the Pacific.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/republicans-maintain-senate-control---split---Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, have retained their control of the chamber after the 2018 midterms. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Republicans will maintain control of the Senate, but it is still unclear by how narrow a margin. The Associated Press projects the chamber will remain in Republican hands, with a Democratic takeover blocked after losses in Indiana and North Dakota. Things got worse for Democrats later in the night when they lost Missouri, too. Retaining control of the Senate ensures Republicans will be able to continue confirming President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, but advancing some of his policy priorities might run into complications with the House flipping to the Democrats on Tuesday night. Democrats always faced daunting odds of winning the Senate. They had 26 seats to defend — 10 of which were in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 — compared to only nine that Republicans had to defend. To win the majority, Democrats would have had to have held all 10 of those seats in Trump states, plus flip two GOP-held seats. Watch: ‘Pretty Stoked to be Voting’— Voters Around the Beltway Share Their Election-Day Thoughts Given that Senate math, Trump had an outsize impact on the race for the Senate, barnstorming red states in the final days of the campaign to rally the GOP base. Republican momentum picked up in several states heading into the homestretch. In Indiana, for example, Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly appeared to have the upper hand after the primaries, while GOP nominee Mike Braun’s campaign faltered. But the race tightened this fall, and Braun ultimately defeated Donnelly on Tuesday night. Likewise, the Missouri Senate race shifted in Republicans' favor in the last few weeks of the race. Attorney General Josh Hawley defeated Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. He made the fight for conservative judicial nominees a central part of his campaign. In North Dakota, Democratic Sen. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp struggled to hold on in an increasingly Republican state that backed Trump by 36 points. Voters had previously supported both her and GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, who also came to Washington in 2012, but they had to choose this year. Despite raising millions of dollars late in the race after voting against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Heitkamp remained at a disadvantage in this conservative state. Cramer beat her easily Tuesday night. At the Senate level at least, the heated confirmation fight over Kavanaugh seems to have worked in Republicans’ favor. Republicans said the episode energized their voters, while other strategists noted the late tightening in several of these Senate races was reflective of these states’ Republican lean and GOP voters naturally tuning in late. The fight over Kavanaugh — and the way it nationalized these races — may have also boosted Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn who defeated Phil Bredesen, a popular former governor, to fill the open seat being vacated by Sen. Bob Corker. Not all Republican candidates were able to replicate Trump’s success, though. In West Virginia, for example, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III held on in a state Trump carried by 42 points. The only Democrat who voted to support Kavanaugh, he defeated state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who struggled against the former two-term governor. The party divide in the Senate is expected to remain close in part because Republicans could couldn’t put all of Trump’s 2016 states in play. In Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states that held expensive Senate contests in 2016 — GOP contenders struggled to gain momentum. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales moved both races to Solid Democratic before Election Day, and the AP quickly called the races for Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown and Bob Casey. Democrats also won easily in Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that Trump won in 2016 but that never materialized into competitive Senate contests. Bridget Bowman contributed to this report.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/takeaways-tuesday-election---split---Confetti covered the stage Tuesday at the Hyatt Regency in Washington after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., addressed the crowd at the DCCC election night party. Democrats won back the House in the 2018 midterms. (Margaret Spencer/ CQ Roll Call) Democrats took the House — no big surprise there — but the much-touted blue wave was no tsunami. Republicans held the Senate and even picked up a few seats. But what difference does it make? A lot. Here’s why: President Donald Trump’s administration and federal agencies controlled by his political appointees are about to find out just how unsettling scrutiny by House oversight committees can be. Democrats will head the panels and control the agenda. It’s a target-rich environment, a cornucopia of scandal. Ethical questions about foreign officials spending promiscuously at Trump properties. Junkets, questionable purchases and conflicts involving Cabinet officials. And more. Let’s say, hypothetically, someone living at 1600 Pennsylvania wanted to stop the investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. One way to do that: Fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose dedication to purpose makes Captain Ahab’s pursuit of a white whale seem halfhearted. Firing Mueller — or any other Justice Department officials who might be inclined to protect his investigation — just got a lot harder with Democrats controlling the House. Senate Republicans may get another chance to confirm a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court, as well as a lot more conservative nominees for lower-court judgeships. They’ll have time. It’s not likely they’ll be worried much about legislation from a Democratic House headed their way. Watch: ‘Pretty Stoked to be Voting’— Voters Around the Beltway Share Their Election-Day Thoughts Democrats were loath to use the “I” word leading up to the midterm elections, but flipping the House is likely to embolden at least some of them. Expect more talk about impeaching Trump. Maybe even an impeachment. Republicans still control the Senate. Even if the House impeaches, which requires a simple majority, conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority. For now, that seems pretty unlikely. If Congress couldn’t get much done when the GOP technically controlled both chambers and the White House, what are the odds that it’s going to get better with Democrats winning the House? Bills that get through the chamber can be blocked in the Senate. Trump can blame a Democratic House for nothing getting done, which could become a theme for the 2020 election. And in the meantime, important legislation that affects government funding, farm and nutrition programs — and a lot more — may be punted to 2019. Texas Republicans may be feeling a little blue after some narrow wins Tuesday night. Only 3 points separated Sen. Ted Cruz from Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke — the closest Democrats have come to winning a statewide race in 20 years. Democrats picked up longtime GOP-held House seats in suburban Dallas and Houston, and Republicans only squeaked by in several other races. That could be worrisome for the GOP in 2020 — Texas is a big state with lots of electoral votes. Trump may be seeing red after watching suburbs across the nation vote blue. Democrats flipped the House largely because of gains in affluent, well-educated suburban districts. Voters there didn’t embrace Trump in 2016, and that’s not likely to change if he’s on the ticket in 2020. Democrats who underestimate the enthusiasm of Trump supporters or widespread disaffection with all things liberal in large swathes of the country do so at their peril. Politics have become more tribal on both sides of the aisle. While Democrats made gains Tuesday night, that’s typically what happens in midterms for a party that does not control the White House. And both parties can still marshal strong support going into 2020. Is it possible that Trump may be willing to wheel and deal with House Democrats on some issues that he he’d like to chalk up as wins for his administration? Might he might alienate members of his own party in the process? Could he do all that even while the Russia investigation continues? As the president is fond of saying, “We’ll see.” Multiple choice: What’s the best way to predict a political race? A. Take a poll. B. Listen to a pundit. C. Tape candidates’ names to the wall and hand a monkey a dart. D. None of the above. Yes, the correct answer is D. People lie to pollsters or can’t be reached. Pundits share DNA with weathervanes. And it’s not the monkey’s fault. A dart-throwing primate may be the best of three bad options, but it’s still random.  Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-win-house-majority-heres-theyll---split---Now that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her party are back in power, they have several legislative priorities they wish to pursue. (Margaret Spencer/ CQ Roll Call) Democrats have been abundantly clear about the top items that would be on their agenda if voters were to put them in the House majority, ranging from a campaign finance overhaul to legislation designed to reduce health care costs. Now that the midterm results have confirmed Democrats have won the House, here’s what you can expect with them in control next Congress. [Check out the full House election results breakdown on Roll Call’s interactive.] Outside of a potential tight floor vote to elect the speaker, one of the first votes of the 116th Congress will be to adopt a new House rules package. Democrats have talked about encouraging a more open and bipartisan legislative process, particularly when it comes to allowing amendments to bills, but they haven’t unveiled many specific rules changes they’d plan to implement. Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, has been prepping a draft rules package to present to the Democratic Caucus shortly after the House returns next week. The goal of the rules package, as well as government overhaul legislation Democrats have been preparing, is to restore public trust in government. They feel that doing so will make it easier to build support for legislative items they hope to pass. The central piece of the government overhaul package, which Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has been touting as a potential HR 1, is changing campaign finance laws designed to reduce the influence of money in politics. The omnibus measure is also expected to include updates to ethics and voting rights laws. Democrats already have several bills ready that could be quickly put into a government overhaul package. Those include the Government by the People Act, a campaign finance overhaul measure designed to incentivize small donations; the DISCLOSE Act, a bill to require public disclosure of super PAC donors; the Voting Rights Advancement Act, a measure expanding the federal government’s ability to monitor state election procedures to prevent discrimination; and the Election Security Act, a bill establishing grants for states to secure their voting systems. The Senate, which will remain in Republican control, is unlikely to take up the full package, but there are perhaps a few items the two parties could negotiate compromises on, especially if President Donald Trump gets behind them. But more likely than not, the package will become Democratic messaging fodder heading into the 2020 election. Other legislative items Democrats plan to move quickly on in the 116th Congress include bills they repeatedly urged House Republicans to bring up during their time in the majority but ignored. One of those bills, the DREAM Act, would provide legal status with an earned path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children who are known as Dreamers. Protecting them has been Democrats’ top immigration policy priority, since Trump announced last year his intention to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. His authority to do so has been the subject of ongoing court cases, but Democrats are still eager to pass legislation in case the courts ultimately side with Trump. Trump has previously expressed openness to creating a path to citizenship for Dreamers but only in exchange for funding construction of a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He’s since added demands for cuts to legal immigration, a nonstarter for Democrats. The DREAM Act is unlikely to advance beyond the House as a standalone, and prospects for a larger deal remain grim unless a court ruling provides a deadline under which Congress must act. Even more likely to stall in the Senate is gun control legislation Democrats say they want to pass to strengthen the background check process for firearm purchases. Trump and congressional Republicans have shown zero interest in any bill that could be construed as infringing upon Second Amendment rights. Democrats also have some bigger ticket agenda items they’ve been touting as part of their “For the People” agenda, namely health care and infrastructure legislation. The top three goals of that agenda are to lower health costs and prescription drug prices, increase pay and drive economic growth by rebuilding the country’s infrastructure and clean up corruption in Washington. The latter they plan to achieve through the aforementioned government overhaul package and extensive oversight of the Trump administration. Democrats will likely face an internal debate about how far to go in their oversight efforts, with some members already talking about impeaching Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Health care was the top issue for Democrats on the campaign trail. They hammered House Republicans for passing legislation that would’ve opened to the door for states to gut protections for pre-existing health conditions. But Democratic candidates were divided about how best to shore up the health care system for the future. Some just want to strengthen the 2010 law and add a public insurance option to compete with private sector plans, while others want a government-run system like “Medicare for All.” It’s unlikely that Democrats will spend the next two years hammering out those differences when they won’t have willing partners in the Senate or the White House to increase federal control of the health care system. Rather, Democrats are likely to pass smaller changes to the 2010 law and pursue legislation to lower prescription drug prices, something Trump and Republicans have also expressed interest in doing. Infrastructure is another area that has potential to be a bipartisan undertaking, but Democrats want to spend more federal government dollars than Republicans, who prefer to rely more heavily on private-sector investment. Democrats will be forced to work with Republicans on appropriations if they want to keep the government funded on time. And they’ll need to work together to approve the new trilateral trade agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Other Democratic policy priorities include rolling back the GOP tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals and renewable, green energy policy changes. The vast majority of House Democrats’ agenda is unlikely to be signed into law, but their legislative efforts will show voters what Democrats could accomplish if voters reward them with the Senate and the White House in 2020.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rips-republican-candidates-who-lost-after-distancing-him-n933556---split---President Donald Trump on Wednesday trashed losing Republican candidates who distanced themselves from him during the midterm elections. "Mia Love gave me no love, but then she lost," Trump said at a White House news conference of the Utah Republican who failed in her House re-election bid on Tuesday. "Too bad." He listed several other GOP lawmakers he said had rejected his "embrace" before falling to Democratic opponents: Reps. Carlos Curbelo in Florida; Mike Coffman in Colorado; Peter Roskam in Illinois; and Barbara Comstock in Virginia, among them. Trump had also given shoutouts to lawmakers who requested — and received — his support before winning. He name-checked victorious Reps. Andy Barr of Kentucky, Mike Bost of Illinois and Rodney Davis of Illinois. Those who didn't want the president around "did very poorly," Trump said. Retiring Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., fired back at Trump on behalf of his colleagues. "To deal w harassment & filth spewed at GOP MOC’s in tough seats every day for 2 yrs, bc of POTUS; to bite ur lip more times you’d care to; to disagree & separate from POTUS on principle & civility in ur campaign; to lose bc of POTUS & have him piss on u," he wrote on Twitter. "Angers me to my core." It wasn't just fellow Republicans who drew Trump's ire Wednesday, as he engaged in a series of testy exchanges with reporters from various news outlets, including NBC, at a free-wheeling press conference that ran for nearly an hour and a half. Trump repeatedly blamed the media for sowing division in the nation, pitting reporters against other Americans, said he couldn't understand the accents of foreign reporters and accused National Public Radio's Yamiche Alcindor of asking "such a racist question" when she wondered whether white nationalists might be emboldened by his self-identification as a "nationalist." Alcindor is black. Trump has defended his use of the term in the past by saying that he only means to distinguish himself from "globalists," who he says care more about other countries than the U.S. The news conference wasn't entirely dominated by media clashes. When he was asked whether Vice President Mike Pence would be his running mate for the 2020 presidential campaign, Trump turned to Pence, who was in the audience, and asked if he would join the ticket. Pence quickly agreed. The main lesson he learned from the midterms, he said, was "I think people like me." Though Republicans lost control of the House Tuesday night, Trump portrayed the midterms as a "tremendous" success because the GOP picked up several Senate seats — against the headwinds of historical precedent. He said Republicans in the House "dramatically over-performed" expectations. And he even framed the loss of the chamber as a victory for him. "If we had the majority and we had one or two or three votes to play with we would have been at a standstill," he said. With Democrats in charge, he said, "we can do a tremendous amount of legislation." But he also warned that if Democrats try to investigate him, Senate Republicans will do the same to them, producing a stalemate. And he said that he would not work with them on policy if they investigate his administration. "If they do that then all it is is just a war-like posture," he said.

Acosta had asked the president about the racist, anti-immigration ad from his re-election campaign that was subsequently banned from airing by Facebook, NBC, Fox, and elsewhere. Trump tore into the journalist after he refused to sit down. “I’ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,” said Trump to Acosta. “You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN.” Legend has long been a critic of Trump, telling The Daily Beast prior to the election in 2016 that the then-candidate was “utterly unqualified.” “Trump’s been a public personality forever and that’s fine if you want him to be a reality TV host, but if you want him to be president there’s a different standard,” Legend said at the time. “And remember, his entry into being a Republican was questioning the citizenship of the first black president.” Chrissy Teigen, model, author, and Legend’s wife, often criticizes Trump’s behavior as well. Teigen and Legend even celebrated Trump’s birthday in June with a massive donation to the ACLU after seeing the administration’s policies that separated children from their parents when families crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. “John and I are outraged to see and hear the horror stories of immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to inhumane policies of the Trump administration,” wrote Teigen about their decision to both donate to a good cause and sass Trump. “These actions are cruel, anti-family and go against everything we believe this country should represent.”

A White House aide tried to grab the microphone from Acosta, but the CNN reporter refused to give it up, infuriating the president. “I’ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,” Trump scolded Acosta. “You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN.” NBC’s Peter Alexander, the next reporter chosen to ask a question, defended his beleaguered colleague. “In Jim’s defense, I’ve traveled with him, he’s a hard-working, diligent reporter,” Alexander told the president. Many thanks to my friend @PeterAlexander https://t.co/jCl1g8CHQL Trump later accused CNN of “voter suppression,” citing its election polling ahead of the midterm elections. It’s unclear how he believes the network’s projections led to voter suppression. The president has repeatedly accused CNN and other media outlets of producing “fake news” and has attacked them as “the enemy of the people,” even days after a pipe bomb was sent to the outlet’s office. “It’s such a hostile media,” Trump said at the press conference. “So sad.” Trump also went after PBS’ Yamiche Alcindor when she started to ask whether his decision to call himself “a nationalist” may have emboldened white nationalists. “I don’t know why you’d say that, such a racist question,” Trump said to Alcindor, who is black. “I don’t believe that, I don’t believe it. To say that, what you said, is so insulting to me.” I asked President Trump what he thinks of people seeing his rhetoric as emboldening white nationalists and whether he was concerned that Republicans would be seen as supporting white nationalists. His response: "That's a racist question." I'm simply asking the questions the public wants to know. https://t.co/bZ1cZVBKhd CNN released a statement slamming Trump’s “dangerous” rhetoric minutes after the tense press conference came to a close. “This President’s ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far,” the statement read. “They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.” The statement continued: “While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.” CNN’s response to @realDonaldTrump’s press conference today: pic.twitter.com/tJ3nZDnYwO This has been updated to include CNN’s statement.

---split---10.0---split---http://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/---split---Speaking at a fundraiser in New York City on Friday, Hillary Clinton said half of Donald Trump’s supporters belong in a “basket of deplorables” characterized by “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic” views. “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?” Clinton said. “The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.” She said the other half of Trump’s supporters “feel that the government has let them down” and are “desperate for change.” “Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well,” she said. Trump’s campaign criticized her comments. “Just when Hillary Clinton said she was going to start running a positive campaign, she ripped off her mask and revealed her true contempt for everyday Americans,” Jason Miller, senior communications adviser for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. Read Clinton’s full remarks from the LGBT for Hillary gala, according to a pool report: Thank you all so much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. It’s sort of like the seventh inning stretch. Thank you all. You know, I’ve been saying at events like this lately, I am all that stands between you and the apocalypse. Tonight, I’m all that stands between a much better outcome! I want to thank Laverne for being here at her first political event. Her endorsement, her strong words, her passion, her example, her advocacy on behalf of the transgender community, particularly transgender women of color, is just so extraordinary, and I love the way she wove in so many of the issues that are up for grabs in this election. I think we know what we’re up against. We do, don’t we? [Crowd chants: Yes!] Donald Trump has pledged for appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality— [boos] And if you have read about the ones he says he’s likely to support, he’s not kidding. In fact, if you look at his running mate, his running-mate signed a law that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT Americans. And there’s so much more than I find deplorable in his campaign: the way that he cozies up to white supremacist, makes racist attacks, calls women pigs, mocks people with disabilities — you can’t make this up. He wants to round up and deport 16 million people, calls our military a disaster. And every day he says something else which I find so personally offensive, but also dangerous. You know, the idea of our country is so rooted in continuing progress that we make together. Our campaign slogan is not just words. We really do believe that we are stronger together. We really do believe that showing respect and appreciation for one another lifts us all up. And it’s a special commitment that I feel to continuing to fight alongside the LGBT community. Because this is one of the continuing struggles. We’re filled in this great hall in Cipriani tonight with successful people, raising your glow sticks, thank you so much for contributing a little bit more to get the campaign over the finish line. But somewhere right now in this city is a kid has been kicked out of his house. Somewhere not far from here, maybe a suburb or across state lines, is a young girl who is just not sure what her future holds because she just doesn’t feel like she’s herself and no one understands that. Some kid getting off the bus at the Port Authority and somebody’s waiting to take advantage of that scared but brave kid looking for a different life and a future that actually belongs to him or her. We still have a lot of work to do. And if you think of the work we have to do in our own country, it pales in comparison to the word we have to do around the world. And I’m grateful that in this room are so many people who have broken down barriers, stood up to discrimination and bigotry, fought for the rights of everyone. I was in North Carolina just yesterday and I told them, it’s not only that discrimination is wrong. It’s bad for business. That state which was led down a pathway of discrimination is seeing the results — losing jobs, losing the NBA all star game. Who wants to be associated with a governor and a legislation who set out to hurt the people they’re supported to be representing and protecting? [Cheers] In too many places still, LGBT Americans are singled out for harassment and violence. You can get married on Saturday, post your pictures on Sunday, and get fired on Monday. That’s why we’ve got to continue the forward march of progress. And we cannot do it alone. I cannot do it alone. I’m not like Donald Trump who says ‘I alone can fix it.’ I’ve never quire figure out what it is he alone can fix. [Laughter/cheers] But that’s not what you’ll hear from me. I think we have to do this together. So, together we’re gonna pass the Equality Act to guarantee full equality. We’re going to put comprehensive quality affordable health care within reach for more people, including for mental health and addiction. We’re gonna take on youth homelessness, and as my wonderful, extraordinary, great daughter said, we are going to end the cruel and dangerous practice of conversion therapy. We’re going to keep working toward an AIDS-free generation, a goal that I set as secretary of state, and with your help we’re going to pass comprehensive gun laws… [HILL-A-RY chants] I know there are only 60 days left to make our case — and don’t get complacent, don’t see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well he’s done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment. You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? [Laughter/applause] The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people — now how 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks — they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America. But the other basket — and I know this because I see friends from all over America here — I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas — as well as, you know, New York and California — but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they’re just desperate for change. It doesn’t really even matter where it comes from. They don’t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won’t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroine, feel like they’re in a dead-end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well. [Applause] And what I hope is that in addition to your extraordinary generosity, you will go to our website, hillaryclinton.com, or text join to JOIN at 47246 to see how else you can get involved. And I want to echo what Chelsea said. We are trying to register 3 million more voters and get those voters to commit to vote. We will win if people turn out to vote. There is no doubt in my mind that we will win. [Cheers] But we can’t take anyone or any place for granted. And therefore I am asking you to volunteer for a phone bank, for a canvas — at the very least if you know anybody who’s even thinking about voting for Trump, stage an intervention! That may be one conversion therapy I endorse. [Cheers] Just remember: Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump. So we’re going to have a great night tonight because we are so blessed. You know, we all love this woman either from afar or luckily enough up close — and for my family, it’s been up close. We know she’s the great talent of our time. We know that remarkably she’s had a number one album in each of the last six decades. We know that. But we also feel and see her heart and her passion. And she’s of course been a great ally and supporter of the LGBT community — but of progressive causes and candidates, she’s been on the front lines repeatedly, bravely, never giving up or giving in to all of the incoming criticism that any of us who stick our necks out often attract. So we’re in for a great treat tonight. I could not be happier, more grateful, or excited, than to introduce a woman of such extraordinary presence, that really just her first name — spelled correctly — is more than enough. Please welcome, Barbra Streisand! Write to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.

It has been roundly criticized as racist and reminiscent of the infamous "Willie Horton" ad used in the 1988 presidential campaign. (Nov. 1) AP President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP) The barrage of racially divisive messaging in the 2018 midterm election cycle was inescapable. Mailers depicted Jewish candidates clutching wads of cash. Robocalls in Georgia featured a person impersonating Oprah Winfrey, who described Stacey Abrams, running to be the first black female governor, as “a poor man’s Aunt Jemima.” Attack ads in a New York congressional race cast an African-American candidate and Rhodes scholar as a “big-city rapper.” A Republican congressman in California sent out campaign literature questioning whether his Palestinian-Mexican opponent was a “national security threat.” Less than a week before Election Day, President Donald Trump tweeted a 53-second video that portrayed a caravan of asylum-seeking immigrants as an invading horde – a spot decried as racist. During Trump's presidential campaign, he labeled Mexicans as rapists and criminals. The number of racially divisive ads was jarring, said political scientists and researchers who track political advertising. “The new surge in nakedly racist appeals shows that, for a segment of the country at least, racism is no longer anything to be ashamed of,” said Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University in New Jersey. “While these attacks would have been seen as huge mistakes in previous decades, they’re now seen by some strategists as a savvy move to mobilize a certain segment of white conservatives.” That can be attributed, in part, to the diversity of this year’s Democratic candidates, which included a number of African-American, Latino, Muslim and Native American contenders, Kruse said. Kruse said the turn to more overtly racist campaign messages can be traced to the Republican Party leader. “Republican candidates do seem to be following the proven Trump blueprint of appealing to the fears and prejudices of white voters to a considerable degree,” Kruse said. Jamila Michener, a professor at Cornell University in New York who studies the intersection of race and politics, said Trump’s rhetoric gave other Republicans permission to use language and race-baiting strategies once considered out-of-bounds. “Look, if the commander in chief can open up his campaign by stigmatizing people who are immigrants and depicting them as rapists and that his campaign, continued at that pitch, with that level of racism, ends up being successful,” Michener said, “that's a signal to his counterparts across the political spectrum that our voters are open to this – and that at the very least, they will not dole out sharp consequences for it.” In the Florida gubernatorial race, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is black, was targeted by robocalls using offensive minstrel dialect and jungle music. Former Congressman Ron DeSantis, who defeated DeSantis, called the attacks “appalling and disgusting.” DeSantis was accused of racism during the campaign after he said, "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state." “I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,” Gillum said in a debate. “I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist.” A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. In California’s 50th Congressional District, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was re-elected, despite being indicted in August on charges of misusing campaign funds. His campaign was criticized for ads that tried to tie his opponent, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is of Palestinian-Mexican heritage, to radical Muslims and described him as a “national security risk” who is trying to “infiltrate Congress.” “We stand by the ad. It’s factually correct,” Michael Harrison, a spokesman for the Hunter campaign, said on Election Day. “There’s nothing factually incorrect, and it’s important for people to know.” In Iowa, GOP Rep. Steve King was re-elected to his seat in the 4th Congressional District even as he faced criticism for his ties to white nationalists, history of anti-immigrant and racist remarks and his support of a neo-Nazi party in Europe. The Republican victories may clear the path for more racially charged rhetoric in campaigns, Michener said. “It signals something to the other folks who are running about what the possibilities now are,” Michener said. “Unless it's alienating your own base in some way, or some part of your direct constituency, I don't think we're going to see as much disincentivization this year of this behavior as we might once have.” In the past, mainstream candidates tried to distance themselves from egregious advertising, such as the infamous Willie Horton campaign ad. The ad, put out by a conservative PAC in support of George H.W. Bush's 1988 presidential bid, focused on Horton, a convicted murderer who committed a violent rape while out of prison on a furlough program supported by Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign manager, apologized for the “naked cruelty” of using Horton as political tinder. In contrast, Kruse said, Trump seems to relish using charged rhetoric and tweeted the anti-immigrant ad, which was rejected as racist by CNN, then Fox News and NBC. “Bush never would’ve pushed the mugshot ad under his own name, and certainly not personally, as all sides knew it would’ve killed his campaign,” Kruse said. “Trump put this out personally and proudly.” Tammy Brackens, 48, a Houston nurse, was dismayed by what she called scare tactics used in campaign ads. (Photo: Monica Rhor) People interviewed Tuesday were either repulsed by racist appeals or said they did not pay attention to the ads. Doris Flores shrugged off the negative tactics. “I haven’t really paid attention to them,” said the 53-year-old nurse and Trump supporter, who is originally from the Philippines. Though she called the words coming out of the president’s mouth “horrible,” Flores said she likes his policies. Tammy Brackens, 48, a nurse who lives in a Houston suburb, condemned the ads as “mudslinging and scare tactics.” She acknowledged that they could be effective in driving people to the polls out of fear. “They’re disgusting, completely nauseating,” said retired artist David LeJeune, 69, a Democrat who lives in the Houston area. “Most of it is exaggeration completely geared to skew people who are easily manipulated.” There were significantly more negative ads during this year’s midterms, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. The number of negative ads rose 61 percent compared with 2014. Seventeen percent of Republican ads in federal races centered on immigration. “This is where a lot of the racially tinged advertisements were being seen,” said Travis Ridout, co-director for the Wesleyan Media Project. “We were not seeing a lot of ads showing the wonderful contributions immigrants have made to the fabric of our country. They were making people scared of people coming across the border.” Michener said the stoking of racial divisions runs deeper than the current political leadership. It’s a continuation of dynamics long at play in American politics. “President Trump has certainly sparked that. He's amplified it and exacerbated it, but he's working with what was already there,” Michener said. “A lot of that stuff has been embedded in our polity from before the beginning, before we were even the United States. It never goes away.” At times, she said, it is more latent. Other times, it is more blatant. “This is a kind of blatant period for us,” Michener said. “Race and racism is out front as part and parcel of who we are as a country.” Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis tells his daughter to "build the wall" in his latest political ad.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/whitaker-mueller-trump.html---split---Supported by By Adam Goldman and Edward Wong WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the attorney general’s chief of staff, jockeyed over the last two months to replace his boss by forging a close relationship with the White House, where he was seen as a reliable political ally. On Wednesday, President Trump fired Jeff Sessions and named Mr. Whitaker acting attorney general, rewarding his loyalty. Inside the Justice Department, senior officials, including Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, have viewed Mr. Whitaker with intense suspicion. Before his current job at the Justice Department, Mr. Whitaker, a former college football tight end, was openly hostile on television and social media toward the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and was seen by department officials as a partisan and a White House spy. The special counsel is leading the investigation into whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates conspired with Russia during 2016 election and whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry. Now Mr. Whitaker will oversee Mr. Mueller’s investigation, prompting concerns that he could move swiftly to shut it down or hobble it, despite serious questions about his own potential conflicts in supervising it. [Read more about how Mr. Sessions’s firing could affect the Russia investigation.] In August 2017, Mr. Whitaker highlighted on Twitter a Philly.com opinion article with the headline “Note to Trump’s Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob.” In his tweet, Mr. Whitaker wrote that it was “worth a read.” The same day, as a legal commentator for CNN, he wrote an opinion article for the cable network’s website with the headline “Mueller’s Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far.” He called on Mr. Rosenstein to “order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation.” In another tweet that same summer, Mr. Whitaker argued against legislation that would protect Mr. Mueller’s investigation and accused the F.B.I. of intimidation tactics when agents raided the house of Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort was prosecuted by Mr. Mueller’s team and later convicted of federal charges. Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Trump also share similar views on what they consider the need for a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. The F.B.I. investigated but closed the case without bringing charges in 2016. Mr. Sessions rebuffed calls for another special counsel. “Whitaker’s appointment raises blaring alarms about the acceleration of obstruction of justice and a fundamental attack on the rule of law in our country,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “Congress must act right now to protect the special counsel’s investigation.” People close to the president said Mr. Whitaker first came to the attention of Mr. Trump because he liked watching Mr. Whitaker express skepticism about aspects of Mr. Mueller’s investigation on television. In August 2017, Mr. Whitaker appeared on CNN and said that if Mr. Mueller began investigating the Trump Organization, “I think that would be crossing the red line.” In a CNN interview the month before, Mr. Whitaker offered a situation in which Mr. Trump could try to hobble Mr. Mueller’s investigation behind the scenes by pressuring the Justice Department to cut the special counsel’s budget. He said that situation was “a little more stage-crafty than the blunt instrument of firing the attorney general and trying to replace him.” The burley Mr. Whitaker, 49, whose Twitter profile shows him lifting heavy weights, played football for the University of Iowa Hawkeyes. He started in the 1991 Rose Bowl, where he caught a touchdown pass on a faked field goal. He graduated in 1992 and had once considered moving to Hollywood to make his fortune. Instead he attended the University of Iowa College of Law. In 2004, he was appointed to be United States attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, a position he held until 2009. He then ran for Senate in 2014, when he campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act. After losing the Republican primary to Senator Joni Ernst, Mr. Whitaker became executive director of the conservative Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, known as FACT. The organization called itself a watchdog group and mainly made accusations of ethical or legal violations against Democratic politicians, including Mrs. Clinton. During Mr. Whitaker’s tenure, the group called for investigations into, among others, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, both Democrats, as well as Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio. When President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court, Mr. Whitaker’s group demanded that Harvard University release records related to Judge Garland’s position in debates there as an undergraduate in 1973 over whether to allow R.O.T.C. recruiters on campus. “We believe Americans have a right to know about Garland’s views of the military,” Mr. Whitaker wrote, according to The Washington Times. Mr. Whitaker has been open about linking religion with legal judgments. In 2014, while running for the Senate in Iowa, Mr. Whitaker said in a debate that he wanted to examine the “worldview” of judges or potential judges: “Are they people of faith? Do they have a biblical view of justice?” “If they have a secular worldview, where this is all we have here on Earth, then I’m going to be very concerned about that judge,” Mr. Whitaker said. Mr. Whitaker has been focused on Mrs. Clinton for years, and denounced her publicly in his role as executive director of FACT. In March 2016, he wrote an op-ed article for The Hill that argued that Obama administration officials needed to appoint a special counsel to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while working as secretary of state. “Perhaps the need for special counsel would not be as clear and urgent without the troubling track record Clinton has had with the truth in this matter,” he wrote. In May 2017, Mr. Whitaker wrote an op-ed for The Hill in which he praised Mr. Trump’s decision to fire James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. He said he disagreed with Mr. Comey’s assessment that “no reasonable prosecutor” would have brought a criminal case against Mrs. Clinton. It is not clear whether the president intends to nominate Mr. Whitaker to be the next attorney general, or whether he will choose someone of greater stature and experience. But Mr. Whitaker has the support of Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley supported Mr. Whitaker to be appointed United States attorney in Iowa in 2004 and was pleased with the decision on Wednesday to name him acting attorney general. “I look forward to working with Matt Whitaker as he takes the helm of the Justice Department,” Mr. Grassley said in a statement. “A fellow Iowan, who I’ve known for many years, Matt will work hard and make us proud. The Justice Department is in good hands during this time of transition.” It is likely that Mr. Whitaker will be in the position until at least early next year because the Senate legislative calender would make it nearly impossible to confirm a new attorney general before the current term ends in December. Mr. Whitaker’s rise comes after a New York Times article disclosed in September that Mr. Rosenstein had discussed secretly taping his conversations with the president and talked about using the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office. After the report, Mr. Rosenstein offered to resign and Mr. Whitaker was expected to take over as the acting deputy attorney general because White House advisers had told him it would happen. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump passed over Mr. Rosenstein, his confirmed deputy attorney general, for Mr. Whitaker, a department staffer. Michael S. Schmidt, Maggie Haberman and Noah Weiland contributed reporting. Follow Adam Goldman and Edward Wong on Twitter: @adamgoldmanNYT and @ewong.     A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/senate-judges-appointed.html---split---Supported by By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — Republicans’ expansion of their Senate majority means that the conservative legal movement is poised to expand and entrench its influence over the federal courts, leaving Democrats with dwindling hopes of being able to swiftly diminish that imprint even if they win the White House in 2020. The net pickup by Republicans of about three seats leaves President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, positioned to accelerate their already record-breaking pace of appointing federal judges through at least 2020. The White House and Mr. McConnell will now have more running room to get young and outspoken conservatives through even if a few Republicans break ranks, and they can consolidate the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court if a justice leaves during the next two years. But the midterm results have longer-term implications as well. By broadening their Senate majority from 51 seats to about 54 (some races have yet to be decided), Republicans have expanded their chances of retaining control of the chamber after 2020. Only a handful of Republican Senate incumbents will be up in states where Democrats are competitive, and they have their own vulnerable incumbents, too. As a result, even if a Democrat defeats Mr. Trump and takes over the White House in 2021, Mr. McConnell is likely to retain sufficient power in the Senate to prevent that president from appointing judges to start swinging the pendulum back. That situation would be similar to what happened in President Barack Obama’s final two years in office, when Republicans, after taking control of the Senate, systematically blocked his nominees to fill vacancies on both federal appeals courts and the Supreme Court. “Getting judicial nominees acceptable from a liberal persuasion into a position to get nominated and confirmed is a slim-to-none proposition over the course of the next two to three election cycles because of the composition of the Senate,” said Bruce Buchanan, a political-science professor at the University of Texas, Austin. The conservative legal movement, associated with networks like the Federalist Society, emerged in the 1980s in response to decades of liberal judicial rulings, and it has asserted increasing control over Republican judicial nominations. It has reached a new peak of influence under Mr. Trump, who vowed to appoint strongly conservative judges to shore up conservative support for his unconventional campaign in 2016. In office, Mr. Trump has taken advantage of the abolition of previous Senate rules and practices that gave senators from the other party, even in the minority, some ability to constrain judicial appointments. In addition to appointing two young and strongly conservative Supreme Court justices, he has already appointed 29 appeals court judges. More nominations are pending, and the Senate could confirm them by year’s end. By contrast, throughout Mr. Obama’s eight years in office, he managed to appoint just 48 judges to the regional courts of appeal. Senate Republicans blocked many of his choices, even in the minority, and then essentially shut down the confirmation process starting in 2015. That hardball strategy left numerous vacancies for Mr. Trump to fill. “From the narrow perspective of judicial confirmations, yesterday’s elections were a huge success,” Ed Whelan, a conservative commentator on judicial confirmation issues, wrote on the National Review website. “Simply put, it ought to be an easy matter to confirm another outstanding judicial conservative (or two) to the Court. That increased margin, of course, also will make it easier to confirm lower-court judges. That in turn might lead to additional vacancies, as some retirement-eligible judges might decide that now is a good time to take senior status.” While conservatives like Mr. Whelan laud Mr. Trump’s nominees as likely to rule according to the text and original meaning of the Constitution, liberals like Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, say that the Trump administration has been packing the courts with “right-wing extremists” who are hostile to reproductive rights, gay rights and civil rights, and excessively deferential to corporate power. “The fear is that they will be able to cement their hold over the judiciary,” she said. After the midterm vote, Mr. McConnell will have some breathing room from the razor-thin margins he has been working with — Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed 50 to 48, with one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, defecting. The problem was also illustrated by the White House’s withdrawal in July of an appeals court nominee, Ryan W. Bounds, after Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, objected to him over racially charged writings. Without Mr. Scott’s support, Mr. McConnell lacked sufficient votes to confirm Mr. Bounds. Republicans increased their margin in the Senate by defeating Democratic senators in conservative-leaning states who had voted against confirming Justice Kavanaugh, like Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and, apparently, Bill Nelson of Florida, although he has asked for a recount. By contrast, a rare Democrat who survived re-election in a state that Mr. Trump won in 2016, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, had broken with his party to vote for Justice Kavanaugh. In 2020, Republican incumbents will be running in states where Democrats have a shot, including Colorado, Maine and North Carolina. But Democrats will have vulnerable incumbents up for re-election, too — especially Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who won a special election in the deeply conservative state last year against an opponent who had been accused of a pattern of sexual misconduct against minors. Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump’s former White House counsel and the chief architect of his judicial nominations until he left the administration last month, said that the red-state Democrats who voted against Justice Kavanaugh had “paid a price,” cementing the judicial strategy Mr. Trump and Republicans have followed. “President Trump ran on judges. He has delivered on judges. And last night vindicates what he has done and shows that it will continue to happen,” he said. “And the overwhelming night the Republicans had in the Senate is going to pay dividends on judges even beyond this election. When one looks at the election map in 2020, it’s easy to see that Republicans are in an excellent position to maintain Senate control regardless of what happens elsewhere on the ticket.” Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter: @charlie_savage.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/what-happens-now-democrats-will-retake-house-n930556---split---WASHINGTON — After eight years in the minority, Democrats are set to regain control of the House in January, bringing divided government — and ambitious oversight — back to a deeply polarized Washington. Unlike the last time they held the levers of power in the lower chamber, they won't have a Democratic Senate or president to help turn their legislative dreams into reality. What they will have: very real subpoena power — and a long list of potential executive branch targets. When they assume the majority early next year, Democrats are planning to make up for lost time on both fronts — though some of the most ambitious items on their agenda are likely to run into a few reality-based roadblocks. They'll be introducing a wave of policy proposals demonstrating the party's priorities on a range of issues, despite the vanishingly small odds that the GOP-controlled Senate would take up any of the bills — and even smaller odds that President Donald Trump would sign them into law. More concretely, they'll be flexing their new investigative muscles with a focus on ethical questions swirling around the president, his finances, and multiple members of his Cabinet — even though they're likely to face legal battles and other pushback that may significantly slow or even stop the progress of some of their highest-priority likely probes. Even so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is expected to become the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that he wants to make sure no stone was left unturned in the GOP’s investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Other committees — including Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary and Ways and Means — are also expected to pursue investigations into the administration. The expected chairman of Judiciary, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., told MSNBC's Ari Melber Tuesday night that "all options are on the table" if Trump tries to "sabotage" the Russia probe or fires "key people" or abuses the pardon power. "We’ll use subpoena power if we have to, when we have to," he said. And Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., expected to become chairman of the Oversight panel, plans to look into the administration’s immigration and child separation policies, financial conflicts of interest, possible violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, and voter suppression efforts, to name just a few entries on a long list of potential targets. The first step in that process: staffing up a new investigative army. In 2011, for example, the number of Republican staff members on the Oversight Committee quickly shot from 40 to 80. “Our staff doubled overnight,” said Kurt Bardella, who served as deputy communications director and senior adviser to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., when he led the Oversight Committee in 2011. “You really can’t underestimate the amount of manpower you really get when you’re in the majority for this particular committee, which enables you to conduct five, six, seven, eight investigations simultaneously.” Ways and Means is one of several committees that could seek to obtain President Trump’s tax returns, which he has refused to release since his presidential campaign, saying he is under audit by the IRS. According to a Democratic aide the committee — along with the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — has the ability to request a person’s tax returns under the tax code. The chairman could submit a written request to the IRS to provide the information. If the Treasury Department were to deny it, House Democrats would have to decide whether to pursue the tax returns through a legal route. If they are obtained, the chairman would have to designate the panel’s members as “agents” to read the returns. They would then have to vote to make the documents public and report them to the full House. It would be far from an easy win: The process, once launched, could drag on for months, or even longer. Publicly, Trump has downplayed any concern over the prospect. "I don't care. They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want," he said Monday of the idea of a drawn-out battle for his tax returns. However that fight plays out, Democratic leadership has pledged its full support for the general idea of aggressive investigations. Impeachment is another story. In the run-up to the election, many Democrats avoided discussing the possibility — which, if it were acted on in the House, would likely be politically dead on arrival in the Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly dismissed it as “not a priority” for her party. While Pelosi, 78, will have to formally be re-elected as speaker of the House, she has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will retake the gavel despite some dissatisfied members who want a new leader. Rumblings over the last year of a potential challenge to Pelosi for speaker again if Democrats won the House were driven in large part by a relatively small group of Democrats running in predominantly GOP districts. (Asked Tuesday night if she had a message for any candidates in that group who had won election, Pelosi said only: "Congratulations on winning.") House Democrats have planned to hold leadership elections for their caucus the week after Thanksgiving, which will be when House Democrats will vote to decide whether to re-elect Pelosi as their leader, paving the way for her to likely win the speakership in January when they hold the formal vote on the floor. And unless there are challenges from other members, the current ranking members on committees will likely become the chairs. The dynamic on Capitol Hill between the two parties will in many ways mirror that after the Republican takeover of the House in 2011, which guarantees one thing: even more gridlock. At the time, Democrats controlled both the White House and Senate and there was only so much lawmakers were able to achieve as the GOP took a series of effectively symbolic votes to dismantle Obamacare and cripple more of President Barack Obama’s policy initiatives. Back then, the new GOP majority came with a new set of headaches: a rebellious group of conservatives who didn’t always stand behind GOP leadership. Democrats are wary of encountering their own internal divisions — between the more establishment-oriented and more progressive wings of the party — as they prepare to shape their message ahead of the 2020 presidential election. “It’s easier to be united in the minority than it is to be in the majority,” said Nadeam Elshami, who served as chief of staff and senior communications adviser to Pelosi when she served as speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011. House Democrats waded through internal divisions in 2007 as they debated whether to fund the war in Iraq and the caucus was “absolutely split,” Elshami recalled, which led to a rift with President George W. Bush early on after the Democratic-controlled congress passed an emergency spending bill saying that the U.S. had to leave Iraq by a certain date. “The president vetoed that bill,” he said. “Really, off the bat, it wasn’t a very good relationship.” Former Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who chaired the House Financial Services Committee at the time, remembers that while he experienced bipartisanship in the beginning, it didn’t last long. One of the first major bills he shepherded through his committee was a measure to outlaw bad subprime mortgages and the committee’s senior Republican, Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., voted for the bill along with several other GOP members. “The reaction of the other Republicans on the committee was fury, and after [Bachus] cooperated with us in passing the bill, he was threatened with the loss of his position as ranking member — and from then on, I got no cooperation from any of the Republicans,” Frank said. A similar dynamic is sure to return next year, with some newly-minted members of the Democratic majority unlikely to be in a mood to hand the president any easy political wins — even in areas where their priorities might appear to have some overlap. Democrats, for instance, are expected to reintroduce their Better Deal legislative plan that includes proposals to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, both of which have been policy goals touted by Trump. They'll also be looking to enhance election security and reduce the role of money in politics, which Pelosi recently said would be their first piece of legislation. While they’ll put these proposals forward, there will be only so much they’ll be able to accomplish with President Trump in the White House and a GOP-controlled Senate — an approach more likely to lend itself to symbolic votes than actual law. Technically, leaders from both parties have expressed a willingness to reach bipartisan deals. In reality, the energy to reach them will be limited, especially when Democrats begin to flex their new investigative muscle. Then there's the baggage of Trump's own history in talks on the Hill, which has been littered with false starts and failed negotiations — meaning the most concrete action out of the new Congress is likely to come in probes of the Trump White House, not compromise with it. Infrastructure, which fell by the wayside in the first two years of Trump’s presidency, has been mentioned as one area with the potential, however remote, for cooperation. House Democrats will likely reintroduce the infrastructure plan that they outlined earlier this year, calling for an investment of $1 trillion to rebuild the nation’s roads, bridges, transit, rail, schools and water systems. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has already gotten a head start by recently meeting with White House legislative director Shahira Knight to discuss ideas. But Republicans — who retain control of the lower chamber for the next several weeks — still have a shot at boosting their own agenda, with one last chance next month to provide significant funding for the president’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border during his first term. Of course, Senate Democrats, who have blocked border wall funding so far this term, are likely to do the same late this year. And so the Democratic goal of derailing Trump policies such as hard-line immigration proposals and efforts to further roll back environmental regulations will take center stage. Come January, the new House reality is that concrete policy action is less likely to involve advancing Democratic goals than it is blocking the president's priorities.

---split---11.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/matthew-whitaker-man-now-charge-mueller-probe-jeff/story?id=59039106---split---Matthew Whitaker, tapped by President Donald Trump as acting U.S. Attorney General, once made a key reception in a Rose Bowl football game, ran as a conservative Republican for the U.S. Senate in Iowa, and wrote an opinion piece arguing that special counsel Robert Mueller was "going too far" in his investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Whitaker, 49, was named the acting head of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) after Jeff Sessions resigned Wednesday after being asked to do so by Trump, according to a letter Sessions sent to the president. Trump has long been angered by Sessions' decision to recuse himself in March 2017 from the Russia investigation headed by Mueller. Whitaker had been Sessions' chief of staff.   "We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well....," Trump tweeted after accepting Sessions resignation.  We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well....  Whitaker's appointment was met almost immediately with calls from the Democratic leadership for him to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the appointment as an attempt to quash the Russia probe. "It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions’ firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation," Pelosi tweeted. "Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller’s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts."  Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller’s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the probe. "Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general," Schumer said in a statement. Schumer later tweeted that: "Clearly, the President has something to hide." Whitaker, a lawyer from Iowa, joined the Department of Justice in August 2017. It was his second stint at the DOJ, where he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa in June 2004 by then-President George W. Bush. He resigned from the DOJ in 2009 after Barack Obama became president.   In his first tenure at the DOJ, Whitaker served on the Controlled Substances and Asset Forfeiture Subcommittee for the Attorney General's Advisory Committee and also served on the agency's White Collar Crime and Violent and Organized Crime subcommittees. A month before joining the DOJ for the second time, Whitaker penned an opinion piece for CNN.com criticizing Mueller's Russia investigation.   "Last month, when President Donald Trump was asked by The New York Times if special counsel Robert Mueller would be crossing a line if he started investigating the finances of Trump and his family, the President said, 'I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia," Whitaker, then a CNN legal commentator, wrote in the August 2016 piece. "The President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing." Whitaker wrote that he found the possibility of Mueller digging into Trump's finances as part of the Russian probe "deeply concerning to me." "He [Mueller] is only authorized to investigate matters that involved any potential links to and coordination between two entities -- the Trump campaign and the Russian government," Whitaker wrote. "People are wrongly pointing to, and taking out of context, the phrase 'any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation' to characterize special counsel's authority as broad."   He also defended Donald Trump Jr. in a CNN interview for taking a controversial meeting in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer claiming to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, then-candidate Trump's opponent for the White House. "Anybody would have taken that meeting," Whitaker said in the July 2017 CNN interview. Whitaker earned a master of business administration and a law degree at the University of Iowa. He also played tight end for the University of Iowa Hawkeyes football team that lost to the University of Washington Huskies in the 1991 Rose Bowl game in Pasadena, California.   "One of the greatest experiences I ever had as a Hawkeye was playing in that Rose Bowl game and having a catch," Whitaker said in the 2015 article in the Hawkeye Nation, a website for University of Iowa sports fans. "To this day I can brag to anyone who will listen that I had a catch in the Rose Bowl." In 2014, Whitaker ran for the Republican nomination to fill the Senate seat vacated by Democrat Tom Harkin. He finished fourth in the Republican primary won by Joni Ernst, who went on to win the general election.   Following his foray into politics, Whitaker went back to practicing law, becoming managing partner of Des Moines-based law firm, Whitaker Hagenow & Gustoff LLP. From 2014 to 2017, he served as the executive director of FACT, The Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust. Whitaker has also been a member of the University of Iowa Political Science Department Advisory Board and the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys.

But during a testy news conference, he vowed to adopt a "warlike posture" if Democrats investigated him. The Republican president also clashed repeatedly with reporters at the White House, ordering them to be quiet. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi offered to work with Mr Trump, but pledged due oversight of his administration. In Wednesday's news conference, Mr Trump extended an olive branch to Democrats, proposing both parties work together on joint legislative priorities. He suggested they could co-operate on issues such as infrastructure, trade and health. But he said that if Democrats start serving legal writs against him, Republicans would retaliate in kind. Ms Pelosi, who is favoured to pick up the House speaker's gavel, promised her party would serve as a counterweight to the White House. At her news conference, she said Democrats would seek compromise with the president, but "must stand our ground". Democrats will now control lower chamber panels that can investigate Mr Trump's business affairs, including tax returns, while thwarting his legislative agenda. Mr Trump hailed "tremendous success" and an "incredible day" for his party in Tuesday's elections. He took credit for Republicans having "defied history" by consolidating their grip on the Senate. The president also mocked Republicans who did not "embrace" him on the campaign trail, and went on to lose their election races. "They did very poorly," Mr Trump told reporters. "I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad but I feel just fine about it." In ill-tempered exchanges, he called a CNN correspondent "a rude, terrible person" and told an NBC reporter: "I'm not a big fan of yours either." The president became irate when questioned about his characterisation of Central American migrants heading towards the US as an "invasion". Mr Trump told a black reporter who asked whether his self-professed nationalism would embolden white nationalists that it was "such a racist question". Following the press conference, he announced in a tweet he had fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Donald Trump came to the East Room of the White House with olive branch in hand, but it sometimes seemed like his fingers were crossed behind his back. He told the nation he would love to work with Democrats - that it might, in fact, be a good thing that they won control of the House of Representatives - but he refused to back away from any of his divisive campaign rhetoric. Previous presidents who have suffered mid-term setbacks have professed humility and said they learned valuable lessons. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, whose parties lost the House in the middle of their first terms, used the defeats to recalibrate for successful re-election campaigns. Mr Trump entertains no such thoughts, instead calling Tuesday night's results "very close to complete victory". The president may say he wants "unity and peace and love" - but it's clear it will have to be on his terms. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed for a majority in the 435-seat House of Representatives. But Republicans are on course to increase their representation from 51 to 54 in the 100-seat Senate. That will allow Mr Trump's party greater leeway over judicial and executive appointments. In the upper chamber, they captured Democratic seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, won a marquee battle in Texas, and fought a Florida race to a recount. Democrats held on to vulnerable seats in Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia and ousted a Republican incumbent in Nevada, but it was cold comfort. In the 36 governors' races, Republicans won an ugly battle in Florida and appeared on the cusp of victory in Georgia. Democrats captured gubernatorial mansions in Michigan, Illinois, Kansas and Wisconsin, where former Republican presidential contender Scott Walker was beaten. Female candidates fared particularly well in an election cycle that had been billed as the Year of the Woman. Two 29-year-old Democrats - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer - are due to be the youngest women ever to win House seats. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women and Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland the first Native American women to be elected to Congress. All are Democrats. Ayanna Pressley was elected as Massachusetts' first black congresswoman. Mr Trump had publicly humiliated the top law official over the Russia probe dogging his presidency. 15 sayings from around the world
---split---11.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/despite-losing-house-trump-declares-big-victory---split---President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House on Oct. 31 with Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images file photo) Updated 8:21 a.m. | Even though his party lost control of the House, President Donald Trump declared a “big victory” on Wednesday morning as he focused on Republicans picking up seats in the Senate. The Associated Press projects the chamber will remain in Republican hands, with a Democratic takeover bid blocked after losses in Indiana and North Dakota. But Democrats, fueled by wins in key suburbs, will control the House come November. NBC, ABC News and CNN are projecting Democrats would take control of the chamber even as the outcome in a number of competitive races remains unclear. Trump will hold a news conference at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, his first chance to lay out an agenda for a split government, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in her own tweet. It also will give him a chance to explain how he will work with Democrats. He has yet to broker a major bipartisan deal. The president spent the final days and weeks of the midterm cycle mostly campaigning for GOP Senate and gubernatorial candidates in battleground states. Many of those candidates were victorious, allowing Trump to focus his messaging there and declare himself a GOP savior. [Democrats Take Control of the House With Victories in the Suburbs] Trump began the morning after the much-anticipated midterms by claiming he has gotten “so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals.” He has spent much of his turbulent tenure fueling the country’s tribal divides rather than trying to bridge them, and that was the case during midterm campaigning when he daily called Democrats an “angry mob” that wanted “open borders” and Venezuela-like “socialism.” But, at least for as long as it took to type a tweet, the president struck a different tone on Wednesday, writing: “Now we can all get back to work and get things done!” Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!  The president was pushing his "victory" message hard all Wednesday morning, telling his Twitter followers that "any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election" are merely "FAKE NEWS!" To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!  Lawmakers and analysts have pointed to an infrastructure package as the piece of legislation on which there is the most bipartisan agreement, and Trump ran in 2016 on passing a bill to rebuild the country’s roads, airports, tunnels bridges and seaports. But a plan he unveiled last year that called for the project to be funded mostly with private funds received scorn from members of both parties and never gained any traction on Capitol Hill. [Republicans Maintain Senate Control] In another tweet, Trump lashed out at Republicans that shied away from his agenda and endorsement. “Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,” he wrote. “Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!” Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!  Trump’s Senate focus and his party’s expansion of its narrow majority means he and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can keep putting conservatives on federal benches. But it’s less clear if split government can produce legislative results. During his final day of campaigning on Monday, Trump was asked how he would handle a Democratic-run House. “We’ll just have to work a little bit differently,” he replied, adding he suspects Democratic lawmakers will want to get a few things done. But House Democrats come January also will have the power to investigate all aspects of Trump’s presidency — and Russia’s 2016 election meddling. Experts say that could quickly put a damper on any bipartisan cooperation. Trump showed he is mindful House Democrats likely will use their new powers to look into his presidency. If House Democrats investigate him, the president tweeted Wednesday morning that he will press Senate Republicans to probe Democrats for alleged leaks of classified information "and much else." A climate of investigations could quickly poison any well of bipartisan legislative cooperation next year, analysts say. If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-s-midterm-campaigning-was-just-his-warm-act-2020-n933026---split---The midterms were President Donald Trump's warm-up act for 2020. His relentless campaigning for Republican candidates — a marathon run at the speed of a dead sprint over the final weeks — was bare-knuckled, base-centric and rarely moored to facts. And it was just a taste of what his re-election bid will look like. That's because Trump drew a simple lesson from Tuesday's midterms: He's on the right track. Sources close to and inside the White House said Tuesday night that the president felt validated by the results. Earlier this year, he launched a brash plan to rally his own supporters to the Republican cause by staging a series of high-voltage rallies, mostly in deep-red corners of GOP strongholds with competitive Senate races. It was the way in which he could be most useful to GOP candidates at a time when his mere presence in tight House districts could tilt them away from Republican incumbents, but it also fit well with his raw and uncompromising style. "Trump disappearing from the scene is literally not a viable option, so you might as well use him and get the best benefit from him," said a former Trump White House official. He played to voters' fears and anger — over the prospect of impeachment, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings and caravans of immigrants. He demonized Democrats as a "party of crime" and "evil people." And he rejected calls from fellow Republicans to focus on their shared economic record rather than sending troops to the southern border and trying to rewrite the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship. His critics in the Republican Party believe his strategy and tactics hurt GOP candidates outside of Trump territory, and may continue to do so for years to come. That may be one of the reasons Democrats seized control of the House for the first time in eight years. But Trump can credibly claim that he'd achieved his goal of safeguarding the Republican majority in the Senate despite the House loss. In his mind, he was right and they were wrong. And his loyalists don't see him altering his formula. "Trump is who he is," said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a close Trump ally. Republicans were relieved Tuesday night that they were not swept away by a "blue wave" of Democratic victories that his rivals had hoped for. But the Democratic takeover of the House, which was carried out in suburbs and exurbs across the country, held some warning signs for the party. After all, most Americans think the country is on the wrong track and don't approve of the job Trump is doing. Beyond that, some Republican strategists say, the president's dark rhetoric is permanently alienating voters who need to be courted by the GOP. "What he’s done with the racist emphasis on immigration and his general conduct, he’s limited any growth among the faster-growing demographic groups in the country," said John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist who advised Ohio Gov. John Kasich's Republican presidential primary campaign in 2016. "Every day the country gets a little younger and it gets a little less white and you project that to 2020 and the math starts working dangerously against Republicans pulling off an inside straight in a presidential election." In that way, Trump's base appeal echoes the course taken by Hillary Clinton, his rival for the presidency in 2016. He is focused so narrowly on trying to turn out the people who already agree with him that he may have lost the ability to persuade anyone who doesn't. The only political answer to that is to squeeze more votes out of a narrow base. But, having invested little in party politics before he became a politician a few years ago, Trump may not care as much about the state of the GOP a decade from now as others in the party. He just has one more election to win, and he's unlikely to change course.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/five-takeaways-midterm-elections-n933336---split---Democrats won the House in a wave, while Republicans outperformed expectations in the Senate, leaving political observers scrambling to figure out what it all means. But, as the results came in, some clear implications emerged for the future. Dozens of theories of how to win were tested by both parties. Some worked, some didn't. And the shockingly high turnout offered seeds of hope to both sides that their coalition may be durable for 2020. Here's what the results tell us so far: There were two broad schools of thought on 2016: Either Donald Trump was a fluke president who only won by drawing an unpopular opponent, the divine intervention of James Comey and a complacent Democratic base — or he was a singular figure who had fundamentally reshaped the electorate. Tuesday offered a boost to the latter theory, with some positive results for his party amid a whole lot of negative ones. No one could say voters were caught off guard this time. Turnout soared in comparison to prior midterms. And once again, many of the trends that helped elect Trump, even as he lost the popular vote, held true. Just like in 2016, rural voters in 2018 turned out in droves to elect Senate candidates in states Trump won, like Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and even purple Florida. But, in another echo of 2016, Trump did catastrophic damage to Republicans in the suburbs, long a traditional source of strength for the GOP. From Fairfax, Virginia, to Dallas, Texas, these angry voters made it clear early that Democrats would capture the House, even with a map whose gerrymandered lines strongly favored Republicans. The wild card for the president is the Rust Belt and Midwest — the "blue wall" that Trump smashed in 2016 — which sent mixed messages on Tuesday night, with Democratic senators winning easily, House challengers picking up key seats and parties splitting governor races. Expect it to be a major battleground moving forward. What may be the most unusual aspect of the midterm cycle is that voters overwhelmingly backed Democrats in the House even with unemployment low and wages growing. In exit polls, 41 percent of voters cited health care as the most important issue, which Democrats universally emphasized in races, while 23 percent named immigration, which Trump focused on in the final weeks. Just 21 percent named the economy, the only time in at least a decade that it hasn't topped the list, and a significant 11 percent named gun policies. Two-thirds said the president was important to their vote, either to show their support or opposition. Prior waves have usually been easy to explain. Either the economy was performing poorly (2010), a major war was going badly (2006), or the White House was laid low by scandal (1974). Trump has seen enough scandals for several presidents, but they played a surprisingly minimal role in Democratic campaigns. That suggests other messages matter a lot more for each party, but it also raises a troubling question for Republicans: If they lose the House by a wide margin when the economy is humming, what happens if things hit a speed bump? Democrats were hoping Tuesday's results would help them chart a course for the 2020 presidential race by clearly demonstrating that either mobilization (boosting turnout among liberals, minorities and other base Democratic voters) or persuasion (tacking to the center to try to win undecided voters) is the winning strategy in Trump's America. But instead of a clear signal, they got noise, with conflicting data that is sure to be cherry-picked by both wings of the party to argue the superiority of their side. On one hand, some of the highest-profile progressive candidates in the country — like Randy "Ironstache" Bryce running for Speaker Paul Ryan's empty seat, Beto O'Rouke in Texas and Kara Eastman in Nebraska — went down to defeat. On the other hand, so did some of the highest-profile moderate candidates. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who cut TV ads attacking "the radical left,” got crushed, losing by about 9 points. That's the same margin that Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is on track to lose by. O'Rouke actually came closer to winning than either of them, losing by only about 3 percentage points. Florida offers a neat example of the muddled picture: Gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who touted support from Bernie Sanders and campaigned on marijuana legalization, finished with an almost identical losing margin to Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who campaigned as a nice-guy moderate former astronaut. It's never too early to start thinking about the next election and 2020 will be about more than just the presidential race. First, there's the Senate. If Democrats had held onto a few more seats this year, even if it wasn't enough to win control of the upper chamber, they would be in a better position to retake the Senate in 2020, when they'll compete in a more favorable set of races. But now, they'll face a much steeper climb. Then there's redistricting, the once-a-decade process where states redraw the boundaries of legislative and congressional districts, which will happen again following the 2020 census. Republicans have been able to hold the House largely thanks to effective gerrymandering after "Democrats picked a bad night to have a bad night" in 2010, as Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez likes to say. While full state-level results remain to be seen, and there's another election before the map-drawing process kicks in, Democrats missed opportunities to install friendly governors in key states Tuesday, such as Ohio and Florida, which will now have Republican governors in 2020. Trump has been a consistently unpopular president since almost the moment he took office, but his upset win in 2016 and the failure of state polls to see it coming created the impression that he'd devised a new formula that defied all past political logic. Sure, things looked bad for his approval ratings, but they sure didn't look great when he was caught on tape boasting about groping women, or when he mocked POWs, or when he made what Speaker Paul Ryan called "the textbook definition of a racist comment" about a Hispanic federal judge. These impressions only hardened when his approval rating, however low, seemed to stay stable no matter what chaos was dominating the news or which former aide was pleading guilty to serious crimes. All of this led many to throw their arms up with a cry of "nothing matters" and assume so-called experts had nothing to offer on how politics works in 2018. But polling and conventional wisdom — that Democrats would win the House, but lose the Senate — ended up being spot on. It turned out that a president who enters Election Day with a 44 percent approval rating still suffers major losses, just like presidents with similar ratings had before him. Democrats lost more Senate seats than many predicted, with Florida being the big surprise, and won some House seats no one saw coming, including shock races in Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Trump-friendly Staten Island. But in general, the pundits got this one right and Trump now looks more mortal than his opponents had initially believed. Alex Seitz-Wald is a political reporter for NBC News.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnns-jim-acosta-press-pass-suspended-by-white-house-sarah-sanders-announces---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Jim Acosta has had his hard pass revoked following a heated exchange with President Trump. CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass to access the White House was suspended "until further notice" Wednesday, hours after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with President Trump. "I've just been denied entrance to the WH," Acosta tweeted Wednesday night. "Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit." White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed Acosta's tweet in a statement, claiming the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his "placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern." She called the behavior "absolutely unacceptable." CNN'S JIM ACOSTA STRUGGLES WITH WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO KEEP MICROPHONE DURING TESTY TRUMP EXCHANGE The CNN reporter, during a news conference at the White House earlier Wednesday, got into a heated debate with Trump after he asked the president about the migrant caravan. Trump told Acosta to let him do his job. “Honestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,” the president said. The reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him. Trump then told him, “That’s enough!” Acosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand. She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn't give it up and there was brief contact between the two. Sanders in a statement — which Acosta later labeled "a lie" — said that "President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration." "Contrary to CNN’s assertions, there is no greater demonstration of the President’s support for a free press than the event he held today. Only they would attack the President for not being supportive of a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of an hour and a half — including several from the reporter in question," Sanders said. "The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration," she added. CNN said Wednesday night that Acosta's suspension "was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference" and claimed Sanders "lied" in her explanation of what unraveled. "She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened," CNN said. "This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support." The White House Correspondents' Association in a statement called the move "unacceptable," and urged the White House to "immediately reverse this weak and misguided action." Trump and Acosta often clash at press conferences. On Wednesday, the president called the reporter "a rude, terrible person" who "shouldn't be working for CNN." TRUMP SLAMS CNN'S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: 'YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON' "I tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you work for them," Trump told Acosta. “The way you treat Sarah Huckabee [Sanders] is horrible. And the way you treat other people is horrible. You shouldn’t treat people that way." CNN fired back on Twitter, calling Trump's attacks on the media "un-American," and fellow White House reporters backed Acosta. The White House intern who attempted to take the microphone from Acosta eventually handed it off to Peter Alexander, of NBC News. He called Acosta a "diligent reporter who busts his butt" — to which Trump shot back: "Well, I'm not a big fan of yours either, to be honest." Other journalists, however, reacted differently, including Fox News' Chris Wallace, who called Acosta's behavior "shameful." Acosta posted a video to Twitter after his "hard pass" was suspended, showing a Secret Service agent removing his media credentials to access the White House grounds from a lanyard. The agent appears to have some trouble removing it. "It's been here for a while, huh?" the agent asks. "Well yeah I've been working at the White House for five years, covering two administrations, so yeah, it's been in that thing for a while," Acosta says.

And in the six other states in the Northeast, the lone remaining Republican congressman, Representative Bruce Poliquin of Maine, was clinging to his seat on Wednesday, his fate to be decided by the second choices of third-party voters through ranked-choice voting. If the country delivered a mixed verdict nationally on Mr. Trump and his brand of unrepentant nationalism and white-hot rhetoric on immigration in the 2018 midterms — Democrats seized the House and ceded ground in the Senate, and the two parties split key governorships — the results were far clearer in a region that once defined moderate Republicanism in America. “This was a wipeout for Republicans in the Northeast,” declared Christopher H. Shays, a former moderate Republican congressman from Connecticut who lost his own re-election a decade ago. From a tax bill that penalized high-tax blue states to a message far more attuned to the ears of rural America than the cities and educated suburbs that dominate the Northeast, Mr. Trump accelerated and hardened a regional realignment that has been underway for years. Almost no Republicans appeared immune to the region’s shifting political winds, no matter how they positioned themselves. Representative Claudia Tenney made appearances with no less than four members of the Trump family in an upstate New York district that the president carried in 2016. She was losing though has yet to concede. In northern New Jersey, Representative Leonard Lance voted against the final repeal effort of the Affordable Care Act, voted against the tax bill and was openly critical of the president’s immigration policies. Mr. Lance even avoided mentioning Mr. Trump by name. He lost, too. Of the 60 congressional races on Tuesday in eight Northeastern states, including New York and New Jersey, not a single Republican is on pace to top 57 percent of the vote ballot. The party was poised to cede six seats — more than one-third of their overall total — and of the nine remaining Republican-held seats, two incumbents were leading with less than 50 percent of the vote. Not long ago, Republicans held half of New Jersey’s 12 congressional seats; now they are possibly down to just one, with Republican Representative Tom MacArthur trailing his Democratic challenger, Andy Kim, by roughly 2,600 votes. Yet regardless of that race’s outcome, Republicans in New Jersey are facing their smallest representation in Congress since President Woodrow Wilson. At the state level, New York Democrats celebrated historically large wins in the Legislature, where the party took complete control. “The question is whether it’s a temporary alignment or a permanent alignment,” said David Catalfamo, a Republican strategist who worked as an adviser to the losing Republican candidates for Senate and governor in New York, “and my gut is it is a temporary alignment that is more reflective of a reaction to the president in Washington.” Some Republicans did win re-election in suburban areas, including Representatives Lee Zeldin and Peter King on Long Island, though their shares of votes, 52.5 percent and 53.3 percent, respectively, were smaller than in the past. Mr. King had warned Republicans late last year that the tax bill would harm them in the Northeast, talking about a suburban “tsunami” in high-tax states on Fox News. He opposed the tax bill even as he remained largely allied with Mr. Trump, who called Mr. King a “hardworking gem” on Twitter on Election Day. The morning after the midterms, Mr. Trump made explicit that there would be little space for those Republicans who distance themselves from him. “Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,” he wrote on Twitter. “Those that did not, say goodbye!” At a news conference, the president openly mocked those he deemed disloyal Republicans. “Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,” he said of one Utah Republican. “Too bad. Sorry about that Mia.” Mike Duhaime, a Republican strategist in New Jersey who has worked on national campaigns, said his fear is that “we’re shrinking ideologically as a party — and that’s a problem.” “Some of the diversity of the party is leaving. If we’re going to be competitive in these suburban areas, if we’re going to take back Congress, it is going to have to be in these suburban areas,” Mr. Duhaime said. “And our brand is going to need to be more than just Trump.” Nowhere was the fracture with the Trump-led Republican Party more potent than in a swath of wealthy suburban enclaves in the northeastern part of New Jersey, where Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, defeated her Republican opponent by more than 12 percentage points. It was a stunning margin in a seat that had been held for 24 years by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a genteel, moderate Republican deal maker who rose to become the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The district had not elected a Democrat since President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Ms. Sherrill’s victory was one of seven for Democrats along the so-called Acela corridor between Washington and New York: one in Northern Virginia, three in the Philadelphia region, three in New Jersey and one in New York City. In New York, Max Rose, a 31-year-old military veteran, ousted Representative Dan Donovan in a district centered on Staten Island, long a Republican stronghold and where Mr. Trump had remained relatively popular. John McLaughlin, who served as a pollster for Mr. Trump in 2016 and who was involved in House races in 2018, blamed Republican congressional leaders more than the president for the losses in the region, citing the tax bill in particular as “a policy mistake that hurt many Republicans in the Northeast and others in high-income suburbs.” While the measure cut taxes across the board, it placed a cap on the popular state and local tax deduction that is heavily used in the wealthier parts of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. “The tax cut was good policy to grow the economy and create jobs, but when Republican leadership refused to negotiate a higher cap or phase it out over time, it made many suburban Republicans vulnerable,” Mr. McLaughlin said. During the Trump era, Republicans have still succeeded in holding blue-state governorships — including G.O.P. re-election victories by incumbents in Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire and Vermont on Tuesday — but voters have long treated federal contests differently from state ones. Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican governor in New Jersey, said the party’s woes were trickling all the way down the ballot into local contests. “We even lost in a lot of the county and municipal races that were in solid Republican districts,” she said. “For the Northeast,” she said, “it’s going to be hard for Republicans to claw back.” Each morning, get the latest on New York businesses, arts, sports, dining, style and more.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/elections-divided-nation.html---split---Supported by By Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns The midterm elections on Tuesday laid bare the growing chasm between urban and rural America, leaving Republicans deeply concerned about their declining fortunes in the metropolitan areas that extinguished their House majority and Democrats just as alarmed about their own struggles to win over voters in states that strengthened the G.O.P.’s grip on the Senate. For both parties, the election represented an acceleration of dizzying realignment along cultural lines. Districts that once represented the beating heart of the Republican Party rejected President Trump’s avowed nationalism as a form of bigotry, while Democrats further retrenched from the agricultural and industrial communities where they once dominated. Democrats took control of the House not merely by making gains in coastal states that supported Hillary Clinton, but also by penetrating deeply into suburban corners of traditionally conservative states in the South and across the Plains, like Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma. The House results made clear that the Trump-induced difficulties Republicans are suffering with once-reliable voters are hardly limited to blue states and could make it substantially harder for the president to remake his upscale-downscale coalition in 2020. “The party should be concerned when you look at what was once one of its bases and see how increasingly vulnerable we are with them,” said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, an old-guard Republican who heads the Republican Governors Association, pointing to Democratic incursions into localities like Cobb County, Ga., that were once conservative bulwarks. Mr. Haslam, whose party lost seven governorships but held onto the major prizes of Ohio and Florida, added, “I don’t think anybody can come away from last night claiming victory.” Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, said his fellow Republicans should be urgently concerned about the collapse of the longstanding political alliance between culturally conservative rural voters and high-income suburbanites who are focused on the economy and issues like education and child care. “We’ve been on a steady trend losing suburbanites, losing college-educated women, and it’s time for the Republican Party to adopt a suburban agenda,” Mr. Cantor said. Mr. Cantor’s home state, Virginia, offered a stark example of the quickening march of cul-de-sac-dwelling professionals toward the Democratic Party. Democrats gained three House seats in the state, including Mr. Cantor’s old district, on the strength of these voters. Republicans faced a humiliating loss in Virginia’s election for the Senate, after a Trump-style racial provocateur won the party’s nomination. The most optimistic Democrats regarded the list of House victories as a road map to a grander national restoration in the 2020 presidential election. Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, in an interview, also held up Democratic wins for governorships in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin to argue that the party’s path back to 270 Electoral College votes had come into focus on Tuesday. “Look at the Southwest and Midwest — in a presidential, that’s what we’re going to need,” Mr. Emanuel said. Not every Democrat was so ebullient in Tuesday’s aftermath. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration, complained bitterly about his party’s worsening struggles with rural voters. “It’s so frustrating,” said Mr. Vilsack, who has been pleading with Democrats to aggressively court the Farm Belt. “You pick out the interest group that’s part of our base and we always have a message for all of those folks, but we don’t do the same thing for folks in rural places.” Mr. Trump insisted in a rollicking and often hostile news conference on Wednesday that he was not at all concerned about his new political fragility, claiming his party enjoyed a “great victory” on Tuesday. He boasted that in the races he cared about most — in the states he frequented most in the campaign’s final days — Republicans largely won. And win they did. For Democrats like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri moderate, the rightward shift of rural America coincided with her own party’s tilt to the left, with fatal consequences. A political survivor who repeatedly escaped defeat over a decades-long career, Ms. McCaskill lost her bid for re-election on Tuesday to Josh Hawley, a Republican who happily parroted Mr. Trump and made the nomination of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh the centerpiece of his campaign. “The further you get from metropolitan areas, the more powerful Donald Trump is and the more allegiance there is to whatever he says and does,” said Ms. McCaskill, who only 12 years ago won her seat in the Senate by carrying a number of rural counties. Ms. McCaskill was not the only Democrat felled by Mr. Trump’s second-city barnstorming. Her Senate colleagues Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota were also swept out of office, and a number of their colleagues won by far closer margins than was expected. In every case, the results came about for the same reasons: Working-class white voters abandoned their ancestral party. For the Democrats, the power of incumbency and a fund-raising advantage meant little against the strength of this underlying cultural change. In states like hers, Ms. McCaskill said the president’s inflammatory appeals to division and fear were ubiquitous, in large part because of Fox News. She recounted walking into restaurants in every corner of Missouri and invariably seeing the channel airing footage of the Central American caravans Mr. Trump demonized. “It’s time we all quit dancing around what is now a state-owned news channel,” she said. Mindful of her party’s delicate position, Ms. McCaskill said she was also concerned about the implications of a divided capital. “If this turns into, ‘the House investigates Trump and Trump turns the House into his foil,’ nothing is going to get done and that’s not going to help us,” she said. Perhaps most ominous for Democrats on Tuesday were the election results in Florida — the only diverse and densely populated swing state in which Mr. Trump’s party appeared to win election for both Senate and governor. To the shock of national Democratic leaders, Senator Bill Nelson was trailing Wednesday evening in a re-election battle against Gov. Rick Scott, while Andrew Gillum, the liberal mayor of Tallahassee, was defeated by Ron DeSantis in his bid for governor despite leading in most every poll during the general election. Just as Mr. Trump did two years ago there, Mr. Scott and Mr. DeSantis rolled up wide margins in the state’s rural reaches and conservative-leaning retirement hubs, and won just enough Hispanic voters to offset their losses with African-Americans and suburbanites. Those results reinforced for Democrats that there is a limit to the inroads they can make in historically Republican communities. And some of the Democratic lawmakers who were most essential to securing the House majority warned that the party could not take its gains in the suburbs for granted. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democratic moderate from Florida, said the party would have to manage its House majority carefully in order to cement its emerging coalition. Having won a second term Tuesday in a purple district around Orlando, Ms. Murphy said the less-ideological voters who abound in districts like hers were open to electing Democrats they viewed as reasonable and public-minded. Hey, I’m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I’ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.  When the new Congress is sworn in, Ms. Murphy predicted, Democrats will not “veer as far left as the Republicans wanted voters to believe.” “The party still needs to be a big-tent party that allows members to deliver for their constituencies,” Ms. Murphy said. “We now have a bunch of new members who are representing districts that are more purple and red than they are dark blue.”     A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

---split---13.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/elections-behind-him-trump-starts-cleaning-house-n933756---split---In forcing out Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump may have signaled the beginning of the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Trump had heeded the concerns of Republicans who worried that firing Sessions before Tuesday's midterm elections could spark a backlash among voters if they perceived him to be somehow obstructing justice. Now, with those elections just hours behind him and Sessions already out of the way, Trump's new acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, will have authority over Mueller's purse strings, the parameters of his investigation, the timeline for the conclusion of his work and even his personal job security. "The acting attorney general is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,” agency spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. But Washington insiders say it's unlikely Trump or his appointees will go so far as to sack Mueller — because they don't have to. Matt Schlapp, a close ally of the president and chairman of the American Conservative Union, said it makes sense for the Justice Department to end the probe sooner rather than later, and that there's no need to fire Mueller to get that done. "It’s perfectly appropriate for DOJ to decide to close down the investigation, because we just had a nationwide campaign in every corner of America where the Russia collusion theme was not brought up by Democrats," Schlapp said. "If they decide to essentially end his work, he’s still going to be able to testify on the Hill. They can’t keep him quiet. You don’t accomplish a whole heck of a lot more in terminating him." But Sessions' departure, which the president announced on Twitter after declining to do so during a nearly 90-minute press conference earlier in the day, is just the first in what administration observers expect will be a series of changes to Trump's Cabinet and White House lineup in the coming weeks. As eager as he is to put any aspersions about Russian interference in the 2016 election behind him as he gears up for his 2020 re-election bid, Trump is equally eager to rid himself of lieutenants he perceives as disloyal, incompetent or simply misplaced in his administration. The president frequently speaks disdainfully of members of his team, and he has mused openly about the possible departure of some, such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. "He may leave," Trump said on CBS's "60 Minutes" last month. In the same interview, he said Mattis wasn't well informed on the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "I think I know more about it than he does," the president said. Closer in than his Cabinet, Trump is expected to make changes on his White House staff. His chief of staff, John Kelly, has been perpetually rumored to be on the chopping block almost since he took the job last year. On Wednesday, Trump declined to address a question as to whether his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, would soon be on her way out. "He did the right thing in ending this tortured public relationship with Jeff Sessions, and it would be normal for an administration at this point, heading into an election, to make sure that they rethink the entire team," Schlapp said. "Look for more changes to come." Still, few moves were poised to cause as much of a stir in Washington as the long-expected firing of Sessions, an archconservative on policy who has become a symbol for liberals because his recusal on Russia-related matters had prevented him from interfering with Mueller's work. On Wednesday, Democrats threatened to hold Trump accountable if the Justice Department short-circuits Mueller's probe. "Donald Trump may think he has the power to hire and fire whomever he pleases, but he cannot take such action if it is determined that it is for the purposes of subverting the rule of law and obstructing justice," said New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who will be taking over as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in January. "If he abuses his office in such a fashion, then there will be consequences." Some Republicans also expressed concern about the situation. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who did not seek re-election, said on Twitter that he wants the Senate to vote on legislation designed to protect the Mueller probe from political interference, while Sen. Susan Collins of Maine used the same medium to note her worry about defending the sanctity of the investigation. From Trump's perspective, the only reason to hold off on a bloodbath at the Justice Department has been the potential political fallout. "I could fire everybody right now, but I don’t want to stop it right now, because politically I don't want to stop it," he said just hours before he cashiered Sessions. Now that the midterms are over and his party has lost control of the House, his political concerns move beyond voter backlash. For Trump, there's a new nightmare on the horizon: Hill opponents — with subpoena power.

---split---13.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/democrats-house-majority-strategy.html---split---Supported by By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON — A day after Democrats recaptured the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the longtime party leader, promised to work with President Trump and Senate Republicans on issues where they could agree, while vowing the new majority would assert itself when necessary. “We have a responsibility to find common ground where we can,” Ms. Pelosi, of California, said Wednesday in an interview. “If not, we stand our ground.” It did not take Mr. Trump long to test Ms. Pelosi’s resolve. Less than 24 hours after losing the House in convincing fashion, Mr. Trump abruptly announced that he had fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, exciting alarm among Democrats who worried that the president was moving toward shutting down the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The turn of events encapsulated the conflicting pressures on Ms. Pelosi and her new Democratic majority. Voters in traditionally Republican districts in the suburbs joined those in more heavily Democratic communities to elevate Democrats to power as a check on Mr. Trump after he spent the past two years largely unconstrained by a compliant House and Senate led by Republicans. At the same time, Democrats cannot overreach in pursuing Mr. Trump, lest they jeopardize the many Democratic newcomers from swing districts who could be tossed out in two short years if they are seen as going too far. The Democratic reaction to the attorney general’s firing also illustrated a new reality for the president. In the past, Mr. Trump could take such striking action with little fear of repercussions from Capitol Hill; Republicans were reluctant to challenge him, and Democrats were powerless to do so. Now, after Democrats take control in early January, the party will have the authority to convene hearings, call witnesses and investigate the president’s actions, and they made clear on Wednesday that they intend to do so. Mr. Sessions’s firing “presents a constitutional crisis one day after voters across the nation rebuked the president,” said Representative Cheri Bustos, an influential Democrat from Illinois. “Democrats won on a pledge to restore accountability to government, and that is exactly what we will do.” Mr. Trump was free to ignore such protests from Democrats in the past. But come January, he will not find it so easy, given the subpoena power of committee chairmen. He did warn that Republicans would retaliate with investigations of their own and refuse to do business with the Democrats if they pursued what he considered unfounded investigations into him and his administration. “If that happens,” Mr. Trump said, “then we’re going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt.” At a celebratory news conference, Ms. Pelosi ticked through the issues she said Democrats intended to pursue: “lower health care costs, lower prescription drugs, bigger paychecks, building infrastructure, clean up corruption to make America work for American people’s interest, not for special interest.” She appeared confident and determined to make a legislative impact, not just pursue Mr. Trump. But she said that the Democratic Party was not about to back off its oversight duties — no matter what the president said. “I don’t think we’ll have any scattershot freelancing in terms of this,” she said. “We will have a responsibility to honor our oversight responsibilities, and that’s the path that we will go down.” But that, too, presents a challenge for Ms. Pelosi, who is increasingly confident she will become the first person since Sam Rayburn in the 1950s to lose and then regain the position of House speaker. In the campaign, Democrats were careful not to make the possible impeachment of Mr. Trump a central element of their message strategy, and they will have to tread carefully. “The path to a majority was in moderate and right-of-center districts, so de facto, the Democratic caucus will grow to the center,” said Steve Israel, a former Democratic House member from New York who previously managed the party’s campaign effort. “If the Democratic agenda is about two things, impeaching Trump and abolishing ICE, it is going to be 2008 all over again — two years later, and you lose your majority.” Top among the issues they campaigned on was health care. After losing their grip on the House in 2010 in a backlash to the Affordable Care Act, Democrats were able to regain a majority by emphasizing their commitment to health insurance coverage while capitalizing on deep voter dissatisfaction with the president in the suburbs. The Democratic victory in the House, and the fact that Republicans were put on the defensive on the issue, means that the stalled effort to repeal the new health care law is dead, for now. Instead, Democrats intend to emphasize legislation that would lower the cost of prescription drugs, with a goal of getting a bill into the Senate and making Republicans take a stand on the issue. It is one area where House Democrats may align more with Mr. Trump, who has also embraced efforts to lower drug costs, than Senate Republicans. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who saw his Republican ranks expand Tuesday, acknowledged Wednesday that repeal was off the table. But he said that continued problems with the health care law still needed to be addressed, only now on a bipartisan basis. “Rhetoric doesn’t solve the problem,” he said. Democrats said their party must take advantage of its new power, not only to confront Mr. Trump, but to showcase what a future Democratic government would look like. “As opposed to when we were in the minority trying to find a message, we now have an opportunity to push an agenda that shows what we would do if we had control of the Senate and White House, as well,” said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the incoming Budget Committee chairman.

Oh, he was? OK, I see. I don’t know,” Trump said before denying the claims and insisting he’s “never used racist remarks.” As the reporter attempted to press the question, Trump spoke over him, telling him to be “quiet” and eventually pointing to the reporter and saying, “See, when you talk about division, it’s people like this that cause division, great division.” Here's Trump saying that he doesn't know who Lil Jon is even though he was on Celebrity Apprentice. pic.twitter.com/EcJ3awjxbt In 2016, three show staffers from Season 13 of Trump’s former reality show “Celebrity Apprentice All Stars” told The Daily Beast that the then-presidential nominee not only used the term “Uncle Tom” in reference to Lil Jon, but refused to stop using the offensive term even after producers asked him to stop. The incident reportedly occurred in an episode where the rapper wore an Uncle Sam costume for a challenge. Apparently, when Trump heard about the gimmick, he started calling Lil Jon “Uncle Tom” instead of “Uncle Sam.” Lil Jon responded to the report on Twitter, saying that Trump did call him “Uncle Tom” but stopped after he was confronted. pic.twitter.com/BTLCWa0AlA “When this ‘Uncle Tom’ incident happened on Celebrity Apprentice in the boardroom several of my cast mates and I addressed Mr. Trump immediately when we heard the comment,” Lil Jon tweeted in 2016. “I can’t say if he knew what he was actually saying or not but he did stop using that term once we explained it’s offensiveness.” The rapper added: “I also want to be clear that I don’t agree with many of the statements Mr. Trump has said during his current run for President.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---13.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-democrats-impeach-trump---split---President Donald Trump may avoid impeachment proceedings unless investigations uncover a whopper. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images file photo) House Democrats will be hesitant to use their newly regained majority to launch impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump unless investigations uncover such major misdeeds that even Republicans would support the effort. A vocal portion of House Democrats still are expected to call for Trump’s impeachment over allegations he has misused the office or committed crimes, and dozens backed an effort to force the House to consider articles of impeachment within the past year. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly) Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 But key Democrats did not support that effort and have made only cautious comments when talking about the subject. They include Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the expected chairman of the House Judiciary Committee where the impeachment process would begin, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and other party leaders. “I think there’s some idea out there that impeachment is on the top of the agenda and this is something Democrats want to run with,” said John Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written about the topic. “I don’t think that’s the case.” Margaret Tseng, a history and politics professor at Marymount University and author of “The Politics of Impeachment,” said it “is very unlikely Democrats would pursue something of that nature, even if they take control of the House.” Here are three reasons Democrats would be reluctant to start impeachment proceedings against Trump: House Democrats could impeach Trump, but two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to remove him from office and there’s really no path to getting there with what is known about Trump today, Hudak said. Depending on how many Democrats are in the Senate next term, about 18 Republicans would have to risk their political futures to remove a president who is popular among their party base and has criticized members of Congress from his own party. Hudak said the political argument would be difficult, short of a bombshell from a congressional investigation or from Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III — such as finding impeachable crimes in his probe into connections between Russian operatives and the president’s 2016 campaign. Tseng agreed. “You’re talking about actual Republicans having to cross over the aisle and say, ‘We think these are impeachable offenses,’ ” she said. That’s something Nadler himself has cautioned against when asked about impeachment, saying that you shouldn’t remove a president from office unless you get “an appreciable fraction” of Trump voters to agree that Democrats had to do it. “If evidence arises that is of sufficient gravity to justify impeaching the president, and of sufficient persuasiveness to persuade people, at least by the end of the process, some of the people who voted on the other side, then you consider an impeachment, but not before,” Nadler said in a February appearance on MSNBC. And even if Democrats could successfully remove Trump from office, they would face a President Mike Pence who would not have much different policy preferences than Trump. “What does that really do for you? Not that much,” Hudak said. An impeachment effort would be a huge deal that would sap attention and resources from the other oversight investigations into the Trump administration that Democrats could use as a platform for the bigger prize of retaking the White House in 2020, Hudak and Tseng said. “It would be smart for them to actually think about an agenda they could promote instead of being anti-Trump,” Tseng said. Short of an obvious and clear violation of laws and violation of constitutional duties that would compel them to act, Democrats “can get a better bang for their buck elsewhere on their investigations,” Hudak said. If Democrats want to highlight the incompetence and corruption they perceive in the Trump administration, then they can push investigation after investigation. That can be a more powerful narrative heading into the 2020 presidential elections than a failed impeachment effort, Hudak said. An impeachment effort could risk appearing like a party that’s more intent on opposing Trump than improving or changing policies. And the Republican effort to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998 actually led to higher job approval ratings for the president. “It seemed to fly in the face of what the public wanted,” Tseng said. “And the lesson would be, ‘Is this something we want to pursue because this would be a reflection of us as a party, especially ahead of a presidential election?’ ” Pelosi recognizes that being perceived as overreaching on impeachment could hurt Democrats, even as it stirs the base of both political parties, Hudak said. The question for Pelosi "is not whether Democrats want her to move forward with impeachment, it’s whether independents want her to move forward with impeachment," Hudak said.

---split---14.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/trump-midterms-sessions-russia.html---split---Supported by The Democrats made progress in the midterm elections. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Well, that was bittersweet. I’m not sure I would call Tuesday’s election results the blue wave many expected, but liberals absolutely made progress — and history — as Democrats assumed control of the House of Representatives, in part by electing a historic number of women to the body. Furthermore, the incredible diversity of the newly elected Democratic class offers a more comprehensive reflection of the current contours of the nation. But there was also heartbreak, as Republicans increased their margin in the Senate and some acclaimed liberal hopefuls in the South came close but fell short. That may temper excitement, but it shouldn’t erase it. Whenever a chamber of Congress changes hands, it is a big deal. This is an even bigger deal, because it represents the first real legislative check on Donald Trump’s power as president since he took office. Under Republicans, the House of Representatives made a mockery of its oversight responsibility, if not abandoned it altogether. Trump grew bolder and more brazen as he realized that there would be no political price to pay for his rhetoric and his actions. The Republican representatives were cowed before the pig. Democrats will now investigate and subpoena, which is a necessary and powerful function of the legislature. But it is also true that Trump sees part of the election outcome as a validation and an endorsement. The remaining Republicans in the House may be more Trump-friendly. Trump will no doubt see this all as encouragement to continue his racism, his attacks on the truth and on the press, and to expand his corruption. He has already moved to potentially change the infrastructure of the Russia investigation being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. On Wednesday, Trump requested the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and received it. Matthew Whitaker, Sessions’s chief of staff, will replace him, at least on an acting basis. Before he became chief of staff last year, CNN described Mr. Whitaker this way: “Matthew Whitaker is a CNN legal commentator and former U.S. attorney who directs the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014.” In an article Mr. Whitaker wrote then for CNN under the headline “Mueller’s Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far,” he complained: It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel. In another part of the article Whitaker wrote: Any investigation into President Trump’s finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel’s investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive. It is unclear at this point how this staff change will affect Mueller and his investigation, now that oversight for his work is being taken away from Rosenstein. But there is no way to view this move and not worry about the future of the investigation. Trump now has at least two avenues to appoint a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions: Send a new nominee before a more favorable Senate with even more Republican votes, or make a recess appointment over the holidays. As Steve Vladeck pointed out last year in Slate: Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the president “to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.” And as the Supreme Court concluded three years ago in the Noel Canning case, “the Recess of the Senate” can include just about any formal recess that lasts 10 or more days — no matter whether it’s an intersession or intrasession recess — and the vacancy at issue need not arise during the recess. (Both these holdings were over the nominal dissents of four of the more conservative justices.) As Vladeck explained, the Senate need only recess for 10 or more days with no formal business on the Senate floor — for the Christmas holidays, for instance — and “Trump could simply recess-appoint whoever he wants to serve as attorney general until the end of the next Senate session.” In this case, that next session would end in January 2020. The incoming Democratic majority in the House would have absolutely no say in this. Democrats did well in the elections for the House in part because representation there is a reflection of where people are. The Senate, on the other hand, is tied to land. Indeed, the fewer people in these states, many of them solidly Republican, the more weight each person’s vote carries. The Electoral College lives between the two equations. This, I believe, is why Trump focused his 11th-hour push on Senate races instead of House ones. Trump is solidifying power as a means of self-defense. Trump’s strategy is to survive at all costs.

---split---14.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions/story?id=40279756---split---Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned at the request of President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Sessions was frequently in the spotlight throughout the turbulent first several months of Donald Trump's presidency, from a hotly contested confirmation hearing to his recusal from the Russia investigation in March 2017. His resignation was announced one day after the 2018 midterm elections. Here's everything you need to know about Sessions: Name: Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III Age: 70 (born Dec. 24, 1946) Hometown: Selma, Alabama, which had a notable role in the civil rights movement. Earlier this year, Sessions reflected on the historic nature of his birthplace. "Certainly I feel like I should have stepped forward more," he said, reflecting on the civil rights struggle. Family: He has three children and six grandchildren. He was born to Abbie and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions. His father owned a general store in Hybart, Alabama, and a farm equipment dealership.  Sessions was a senator from Alabama was first elected in 1996 and served as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. From 1975 to 1977 he was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and from 1981 to 1993 was the U.S. attorney for the district. In 1994 he was elected Alabama's 44th attorney general. He supported President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cut packages, the war in Iraq and a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He has opposed most major Democratic legislation, including the stimulus bill, the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell."   In August 2016, he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota he thinks the Clinton Foundation should be fully investigated because he thinks Hillary Clinton used her position as secretary of state to garner funds for the foundation. During his Senate hearing last month, he vowed that if he's confirmed as attorney general, he will recuse himself from any matters related to her.  He was ranked by The National Journal in 2007 as the fifth-most-conservative U.S. senator. He worked as a lawyer in Russellville and Mobile, where he still lives. He was a captain for the Army Reserve in the 1970s. As an Eagle Scout, Sessions was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. The Scouts' motto, "Be prepared," is on his desk in his Senate office.  Sessions earned a B.A. from Huntingdon College in Montgomery in 1969 and a J.D. from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1973. He was one of only three senators to vote against additional funding for the Veterans Affairs medical system. He opposed the bill because of cost concerns and indicated that Congress should instead focus on "reforms and solutions that improve the quality of service and the effectiveness that is delivered." He has taken a strong stance against any immigration reform and believes in the need for a stronger controls on the border with Mexico. He is anti-abortion, is a major opponent of same-sex marriage and is known for the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize funding through 2018 to help victims of child abuse. Sessions said, "There is no higher duty than protecting our nation's children."  In 1986, Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. He was not confirmed. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 against recommending Sessions to the whole Senate. Four lawyers who had worked with Sessions said he had made racist comments. One said he had called the NAACP "un-American" and "communist-inspired." Another said Sessions had called him "boy" and told him to be "careful what you say to white folks." Sessions denied the allegations. One lawyer said Sessions told him he thought the KKK was "OK until I found out they smoked pot." Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized. In his Senate confirmation hearings last month, Sessions said, "This caricature of me in 1986 was not correct. I conducted myself honorably and properly at that time ... I did not harbor the animosities ... that I was accused of. I did not."  Jeff Sessions was sworn in at the White House in early February as the U.S. attorney general. The Senate approved Trump's nominee by a largely party-line vote of 52-47. One Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joined Republicans in confirming Sessions. Sessions' nomination as the head of the Department of Justice drew significant criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups. Critics cited concerns about past allegations of racism, his record on civil rights and immigration and his 1986 hearing during his highly contentious confirmation hearings in January.  Sessions was the first sitting senator to endorse then–presidential candidate Trump, in February 2016, before Super Tuesday and the Alabama primary. "I told Donald Trump this isn't a campaign. This is a movement," Sessions said at a rally in Madison, Alabama. Sessions said that "we don't get everything we want" in a candidate but that "at this time, in my best judgment, at this time in America's history, we need to make America great again."   Trump named Sessions the head of his national security advisory council during the campaign, and shortly after winning the presidency in November, nominated him to be attorney general. Though Trump said he had confidence in Sessions just days before he recused himself from the Russia investigation, he criticized the department in June over changes to his travel ban, blaming the department for the “watering down” of the revised version. The relationship between the two men is said to have deteriorated since Sessions' recusal and ABC News learned on June 6 that Sessions recently offered to resign.  Sessions attended a foreign policy address given by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016 during the campaign. Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was also at the address, but the Justice Department has denied that Sessions spoke privately with the Ambassador that day. Sessions did, however, meet with Kislyak on two separate occasions in 2016 -- once in July and once in September -- which the Department of Justice later categorized as routine meetings for Sessions in his role as a senator. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Sessions told Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, that he “did not have communications with the Russians.” When it became public that he had met with Kislyak, he said the meetings were a part of his duties as a senator and not related to the campaign.   After pressure mounted over his meetings with Kislyak, Sessions recused himself from any ongoing or future investigations into matters related to the presidential election. "Let me be clear: I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign," said Sessions to reporters in early March. "And the idea that I was part of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries to the Russian government are false." When former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, he told the committee that the FBI had information in February that would have made it “problematic” for Sessions to continue leading the investigation into Russian influence over the 2016 election.  Sessions announced he was resigning in an undated letter to the president. "At your request, I am submitting my resignation," he wrote to Trump. "Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Jusitce every day determined to do my duty and serve my country," Sessions wrote. "I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice." Trump tweeted that Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, would serve as acting attorney general.  Sessions Resignation Letter by ABC News Politics on Scribd Previously, Trump would not say whether Sessions -- who he has repeatedly criticized throughout his tenure -- would be safe in his job after the midterm elections. "I just would love to have him do a great job," Trump told Bloomberg News on Aug. 30.
---split---14.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-partisanship-outcomes---split---Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly both lost their bids for second terms Tuesday night. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Both parties had something to celebrate after Tuesday’s midterm elections, depending on where they looked. But that split outcome — with Democrats winning the House, and Republicans gaining seats in the Senate — underscores the extent to which opinions about President Donald Trump shape today’s politics. Republicans largely prevailed at the Senate level because they were running in red states where President Donald Trump performed well in 2016. The House saw the opposite outcome, but the reason was the same. Republicans largely struggled because they were running in places where Trump was unpopular. Republicans at the House level and Democrats at the Senate level argued that they had incumbents who could withstand a wave — lawmakers with independent brands and bipartisan appeal. But many of those incumbents lost. Yes, candidates matter. But on Tuesday, opinions about Trump, which often translated to party preference, may have mattered more. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly) Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 Just look at the House, where Democrats always knew the low-hanging fruit was going to be GOP-held seats that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. These were well-educated districts that often backed Republicans for Congress but wanted a check on Trump this year. Democrats successfully knocked off GOP incumbents who were known for over-performing the top of the ticket, some of who had even brandished moderate credentials in Congress. Just three of the 25 GOP incumbents running in districts Clinton won in 2016 have so far prevailed. Incumbents such as Virginia’s Barbara Comstock, Colorado’s Mike Coffman, Minnesota’s Erik Paulsen, Kansas’ Kevin Yoder, New Jersey’s Leonard Lance and Illinois’ Peter Roskam all fell Tuesday night. It didn’t matter how much they tried to distance themselves from the president or the party. Their constituents wanted a check on the president, and that meant voting Democratic. Minnesota’s 3rd District voters had previously split their tickets, giving Paulsen a fifth term in 2016 by a 14-point margin at the same time they were electing Clinton by 9 points. But this time — Paulsen’s first re-election with a Republican in the White House — was different. Well-educated voters in the Twin Cities suburbs chose Democrat Dean Phillips. Likewise in New Jersey’s 7th District, GOP Rep. Leonard Lance voted against the Republican tax and health care legislation. But in an affluent district that Clinton narrowly carried, that wasn’t enough to save him. Voters here chose Democrat Tom Malinowski, throwing out a five-term Republican known for his moderation and civility. Similarly in Florida’s 26th District, Republicans were banking on GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo once again defying his party’s preference for a Democrat at the top of the ticket. (He overperformed Trump by 12 points in 2016.) He touted his willingness to stand up to his own party, whether on climate change, gun control or immigration. But he fell to Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell on Tuesday. Many of these Republicans have an unfavorable national environment to thank for their loss. That’s not to say their challengers were insignificant. Democrats had to field viable recruits to harness the anti-Trump energy. And many first-time candidates proved to be impressive fundraisers who ran strong campaigns. Early on in 2018, some Republicans conceded that a strong Democratic recruit, regardless of who it was, would doom their incumbents in unfavorable districts. Congressional Leadership Fund, for example, never invested in Virginia’s 10th District — not because Comstock wasn’t a good incumbent or an ally of leadership, but because the GOP super PAC didn’t see a path to victory in a district Clinton carried by 10 points. Even in closely divided districts that Trump won, the national environment helped propel Democrats to victory. Take New York’s 19th District, which GOP Rep. John J. Faso described as a “microcosm of the country.” Voters here backed former President Barack Obama twice and flipped to Trump in 2016. Faso ended up losing to Democratic lawyer Antonio Delgado by 2 points. Democrats in the Upstate New York district have been energized for most of the cycle, holding weekly protests outside Faso’s office since early 2017. While Democrats were making gains in the House, Republicans were securing control of the Senate. And although these outcomes led to divided government, they happened for the same reason. As with key House races, party loyalty overwhelmed sitting senators who previously held cross-party appeal. Democrats acknowledged from the start of the cycle that the chamber would be difficult to flip. But by leaning into their personal brands, it looked like their incumbents might be able to survive in states Trump won. That began to change this fall. The fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Trump’s repeated visits to red states nationalized the Senate contests. In the end, they reverted to their partisan lean — with the exception of West Virginia and Montana. Democratic incumbents held on there, albeit by slim margins. In North Dakota, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, the last remaining Democrat in statewide office, lost to GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer by 11 points. In Missouri, where the race stayed close for most of the cycle, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill fell to state GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley by 6 points. In Indiana, Republicans privately grumbled that GOP nominee Mike Braun was running a lackluster campaign and it looked like Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly’s bipartisan appeal might carry the day. But in the end, Braun defeated the incumbent by 8 points. Democratic hopes were dashed early Tuesday night when they lost two potential pickup opportunities in Tennessee and Texas. Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, the last Democrat elected statewide in Tennessee, was likely the only Democrat who could have made the Senate race competitive, but he couldn't overcome GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn in a heavily Republican state. It’s possible that Texas is shifting further to the left, as Democrats hope, since Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke by just 3 points. But O’Rourke’s millions, large crowds, and the coattails that helped flip some House seats still couldn’t translate into a statewide win, underscoring how tough it is to overcome partisan makeup in a polarized environment. Nevada, though closely divided politically, cemented its status as a swing state with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen unseating Republican Dean Heller. Again, this wasn’t too surprising given that Heller was the only GOP incumbent up for re-election in a state Clinton carried in 2016. Some candidates from both parties defied the midterm trend in their districts or states on Tuesday. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia defeated state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, although the margin was narrower than some polling had predicted. Still, it was a noteworthy victory in a state that backed Trump by 42 points. Likewise in Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester barely defeated GOP state Auditor Matt Rosendale, but Trump carried the state by 20 points two years ago. On the House side, two Republicans in Clinton districts survived due to a combination of incumbent strength and issues with Democratic challengers. In New York’s 24th District, Democrat Dana Balter won a surprise primary victory but went on to lose to GOP Rep. John Katko by 6 points. Balter, who supported “Medicare-for-All” legislation, might have proved too liberal for a district that only narrowly backed Clinton. GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick prevailed in Pennsylvania’s 1st District in the Philadelphia suburbs against wealthy Democrat Scott Wallace, who faced criticism for recently moving back to the district. Fitzpatrick was also the rare Republican who had union support as well as the endorsement of Giffords PAC, which backs candidates who support gun control. Republicans largely won competitive districts where they were favored. But two of the biggest upsets of the night came in two GOP districts, where demographic shifts or local issues could have been at play. In Oklahoma’s 5th District, Kendra Horn defeated GOP Rep. Steve Russell in a race that wasn’t on anyone’s radar. Trump won the seat by 13 points in 2016. Horn’s campaign argued that the district has been changing, citing earlier Democratic victories in special elections at the state level. Democrat Joe Cunningham defeated Republican Katie Arrington in South Carolina’s 1st District, which opened after Arrington defeated Rep. Mark Sanford in the GOP primary. Arrington’s professed support for lifting the ban on offshore drilling during the primary may have swayed this race, where national Republicans made a late investment in the final week.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ORG XMIT: DCEV109 (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Adryana Aldeen hovered outside a Dallas polling station Tuesday with a sign that read "Pete Sessions for Congress" and a T-shirt that said "Latinas for Abbott" – promoting both the incumbent Republican U.S. congressman from the Dallas suburbs and the incumbent Republican governor of Texas. Aldeen, who immigrated from Mexico three decades ago, wasn't letting President Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration get in the way of Republican wins. "I believe in the sovereignty of the state," said Aldeen, a GOP activist and special adviser for Hispanic engagement for the Republican Party of Texas. "This is a nation of immigrants, but we need to do everything we can for the rule of law." Aldeen joins a significant number of immigrant voters who supported the Republican Party on Tuesday and, in turn, Trump, despite the president's controversial stances on immigration leading up to the elections. Over the past few months, Trump initiated a "zero tolerance" policy that led to migrant children being separated from their parents at the border, gave alarming and unsubstantiated warnings about a caravan of migrants coming from Central America, threatened to eliminate birthright citizenship and retweeted a racially charged video linking a convicted murderer to immigrants and the Democratic Party. The tough talk didn't seem to chase away immigrant voters in significant numbers. On Tuesday, Democrats got about 68 percent of the Latino vote, slightly higher than the 66 percent won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, while Republicans garnered 30 percent of their vote, just above the 28 percent Trump earned four years ago, according to exit polling. Asian voters sided with Democrats 77 percent of the time in Tuesday's elections, and Republicans received 23 percent of their vote, the exit polling showed. Victor Sanchez, a pro-Trump Republican from Houston, said he disagreed with the president's threat on birthright citizenship, which is protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, but was not fazed by his tough talk on securing the border. At a Trump rally in Houston last month supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, Sanchez, 25, who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 5, said he was pleased to see other Latinos, from Mexico, Cuba and other countries, rallying around the president and his policies. "There's thousands and thousands of them," Sanchez said. "They may be a little shy ... but once they go to the polls, they vote their conscience." Saba Ahmed, president of the Washington-based Republican Muslim Coalition and a Trump supporter, said it was initially a challenge persuading Muslim immigrants to support the president and the GOP after Trump proposed a travel ban on five predominately Muslim countries. But, Ahmed tells potential voters, it's better to try to initiate change from the inside than complain about policies from the outside. She has managed to get more candidates to speak at Muslim gatherings and would like to see a Muslim in Trump's Cabinet. "The greatest opportunity for immigrants is within the Republican Party," Ahmed said. "We have to get involved. We have to get our voices heard." epa07145946 Latino voters Griselda Sanchez (L) and Evelyn Franco (2L) carry signs that read 'Unite the Vote' as they are serenaded by mariachis on their way to their polling station to cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm general election in Los Angeles, California, USA, 06 November 2018. Voters across the nation are selecting who will represent them on local, state and national levels. EPA-EFE/MIKE NELSON ORG XMIT: MAN01 (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE) Asian-Americans care about immigration, but other issues – such as the economy, trade and college-entrance procedures – are equally important, said Cliff Zhonggang Li, executive director of the National Committee of Asian American Republicans. Trump scored points with the Asian community earlier this year when his administration backed students suing Harvard University over affirmative-action programs they say discriminate against Asian-Americans, Li said. Li, originally from China, celebrated Tuesday night with a group of other Asian-Americans at a victory party in Orlando for Florida governor-elect Ron DeSantis. "Frankly, a lot of Asian-Americans don't like the tone the president uses," Li said. "But so far, we haven’t seen any decisive issue that turns off the Asian-American community." He added: "But we’ll see what happens the next two years or six years." Jacob Monty, a Houston-based attorney and Latino and GOP activist, said recruiting Republican voters became markedly more difficult the past 10 days as Trump fired up the rhetoric against illegal immigration. He got pushback not just from Latino voters but from Anglo business owners, he said, who were turned off by Trump's comments, especially his promotion of a web video showing Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had been deported but returned to the U.S. and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies, mixed in with images of Central American migrants. Despite wins on Tuesday, Monty said he's worried about the long-term health of a Republican Party that supports such scare tactics aimed at Latinos. "I'm worried the brand has been tarnished," he said. "I'm still rooting for the home team, but I'm very worried about it." Follow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis. 
---split---15.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/heres-house-democratic-majority-might-protect-mueller-trump-fires---split---Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will be one of the Democratic leaders in charge of protecting special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) House Democrats, with their new majority, will have an expansive new toolkit once they take control of the chamber on Jan. 3 to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation — even if acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker decides to shut it down. If President Donald Trump, through Whitaker or his full-time replacement, does indeed order Mueller to shutter his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, that would trigger a quick response from Democrats. In two months, they will wield the all-important power of subpoenaing officials. Democrats’ first step would be to preserve evidence Mueller has collected over roughly the last year and a half so that the Trump administration doesn’t confiscate files and hide them. Watch: The Moment Chuck Schumer Learned Jeff Sessions Was Fired With their new majority, Democrats could bypass Trump’s Justice Department, which has the authority to enforce or toss out congressional subpoenas, by subpoenaing Mueller himself to learn what he knows. “You would think Mueller would be in a cooperative mood under those circumstances,” said Kurt Bardella, a former GOP aide for the House Oversight Committee. “Either [top House Intelligence Committee Democrat] Adam Schiff or Judiciary or Oversight or all three — I would imagine they’d do this jointly — would issue a subpoena for all the documents that Mueller had in possession at the time of his removal,” Bardella said. “It would have to be a subpoena because it’s classified information.” Democrats could then essentially move the investigation under the jurisdiction of a congressional committee and hire Mueller, to see it through with full subpoena power. That assumes Mueller would be willing to effectively work for Democrats in a highly politicized role. The Democrats could — and probably would — instead establish a select committee with Mueller or another hand-picked investigator as the committee’s chief counsel. And Mueller might be able to unilaterally turn over his trove of evidence to local law enforcement jurisdictions — the district attorney in Manhattan or the New York attorney general’s office, to name two possibilities — where alleged crimes were committed. Politico reported in 2017 that Mueller’s team had shared evidence with the New York attorney general’s office. Trump appears to believe that a confrontational game of chicken with House Democrats can be a political point machine for him. That’s evident from the events of Wednesday, including the forced resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump’s combative press conference, and his tweets threatening political opponents with counter-investigations for conducting oversight of his administration. “If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level,” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “Two can play that game!” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is apparently on the president’s side, warning House Democrats multiple times at a press conference Wednesday not to go overboard on “presidential harassment.” But if Trump fires Mueller, Democrats say they would have no choice but to respond with rigorous oversight. “If you’ve triggered a constitutional crisis, you’ve triggered a constitutional crisis. And that can’t be ignored,” said Virginia Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, the second-in-line among Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Connolly dismissed the notion that Trump, by ousting Sessions the day after Democrats secured control of the House, is intentionally baiting them into playing up impeachment proceedings. That’s a direction leaders of the party have so far been loath to discuss. “Our experience with Trump is he’s more impetuous than that,” Connolly said. “There may be method to his madness, but he’s also reckless and impetuous. And he may not have thought this through at all.” Trump and other Republicans warned ahead of the midterms that Democrats would move to impeach Trump upon winning a majority in the House, even though Democratic Speaker front-runner Nancy Pelosi of California and projected House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler have made it clear that they plan to wait for Mueller to conclude his investigation. But Democrats had a warning of their own for Trump: If you fire Mueller, we’re going to investigate the circumstances of that decision — you don’t want that. By firing Mueller, Trump would potentially be laying himself a trap by opening his administration and Justice Department up to yet another investigation, this one a sweeping probe into the circumstances surrounding the decision to shut down the special counsel. Even if Trump and his inner circle refused to cooperate, there are always whistleblowers within the government who are all too eager to tattle on higher-ups for indiscretions, Bardella said. “No matter how these [House oversight investigations] start, once they do ... it is almost impossible for the administration to control the outcome,” Bardella said. He cited hearings into an attack in Benghazi in which a U.S. ambassador and three others died as an example of a House select committee probe that ran far afield from its original purpose after investigators discovered tangential indiscretions and avenues of inquiry. “Benghazi started as an investigation into embassy security,” Bardella said. “No one at time had any idea it would lead to the discovery that Hillary Clinton had a private email server. When we asked for all the documents from Secretary Clinton and she couldn’t produce them, it begged the question, ‘Why is that?’” Even if Trump and Sessions’ successor do allow the special counsel’s investigation to run its course, Democrats fully intend to revive and launch a number of other probes that they feel have been neglected by House GOP lawmakers who’ve proven unwilling to conduct executive branch oversight and instead sought to insulate the president from his own Justice Department’s inquiry. “All of that tearing down of the independence of these institutions is going to end,” Schiff, the likely incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. The California Democrat has said he’s planning to reopen the panel’s shuttered Russia investigation. There is a list of about 70 people, organizations and companies that Democrats say the GOP failed to adequately examine.

---split---15.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/mueller-investigation-sessions-resigns.html---split---Supported by By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appoint Mr. Sessions’s former chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, as the acting head of the Justice Department immediately raised questions about what the move means for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation. The shake-up means that Mr. Whitaker assumes oversight of the inquiry from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing cases arising from the 2016 election, citing his role as an active Trump supporter, so Mr. Rosenstein has been serving as acting attorney general for the investigation into whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia’s election interference and whether Mr. Trump obstructed the inquiry itself. He appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel. But because Mr. Whitaker is not recused from overseeing cases arising from the 2016 election, as Mr. Sessions was, he takes over the case. Mr. Rosenstein goes back to his day job overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Justice Department. In August 2017, before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Whitaker wrote in an opinion column that Mr. Mueller’s investigation went too far by looking at Trump Organization financial records and by scrutinizing Mr. Trump’s associates for non-Russia-related crimes in order to encourage them to cooperate. “It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,” he wrote, arguing that Mr. Rosenstein needed to rein Mr. Mueller in so the investigation did not become “a political fishing expedition.” The acting attorney general establishes the special counsel’s jurisdiction and budget. He could tell Mr. Mueller to stop investigating a particular matter or could refuse any requests by Mr. Mueller to expand his investigation. He could also curtail resources to the Office of the Special Counsel, requiring Mr. Mueller to downsize his staff or resources. Moreover, Mr. Whitaker could block Mr. Mueller from pursuing investigative steps, like subpoenaing Mr. Trump or issuing new indictments. When Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller, he decreed that the Justice Department’s regulations for special counsels would apply to the Russia investigation. Among other things, that regulation says that while the special counsel operates with day-to-day independence, the attorney general for the inquiry can require him to explain “any investigative or prosecutorial step,” and may overrule any moves that he decides are “inappropriate or unwarranted under established department practices.” Under the regulation, if Mr. Whitaker were to block any of Mr. Mueller’s steps, Congress must be notified. Mr. Trump was “clearly” motivated to replace Mr. Sessions to affect the Mueller investigation, said David Kris, a founder of the Culper Partners consulting firm who led the Justice Department’s national security division during the Obama administration. An open question, he said, is what Mr. Whitaker will do — and what reactions that will provoke from Mr. Mueller, other federal prosecutors and House Democrats. “What guerrilla-war tactics will he try to take to limit Mueller’s activities?” Mr. Kris said of Mr. Whitaker. “Under the regulation, he has a bunch of supervisory actions he can take and if he does undertake those actions, the more extreme they are, the more likely they will provoke reactions from other players in this drama.” The regulation that Mr. Rosenstein invoked when appointing Mr. Mueller also made it more difficult to fire him. It said that the attorney general may remove the special counsel only for cause, like misconduct of some kind, rather than at will. Mr. Whitaker could decide that Mr. Mueller has committed misconduct and fire him, or he could revoke the protections that the regulation provides to Mr. Mueller and then fire him without cause. When Mr. Mueller completes his work, he is to deliver a report about his findings to the attorney general, according to the regulation. It would then be up to the attorney general — now Mr. Whitaker — to decide whether to turn that document over to Congress or keep it secret. Of course, next year, when Democrats take over the House of Representatives, they could issue a subpoena for such a document, but if the Trump administration wants to fight that subpoena by asserting executive privilege, it is not clear what would happen. Under normal circumstances, Mr. Rosenstein would become acting attorney general. A federal statute governing Justice Department succession says that the deputy attorney general takes over if the office of attorney general is vacant. However, there is another law, the Vacancies Reform Act, that applies generally across the executive branch. It gives a president other options to make temporary appointments without Senate confirmation. There is some dispute among legal scholars about whether Mr. Trump can bypass the Justice Department-specific statute and use the vacancies act mechanism in a situation where he has fired the attorney general. But that appears to be what he has purported to do. Under the vacancies law, a president can install a departed official’s first assistant or install someone whom the Senate confirmed for a different position in the executive branch. The third option — which Mr. Trump is apparently relying on for Mr. Whitaker’s appointment — is to put in place a sufficiently senior official from inside the department, even if he has not been confirmed by the Senate for that role. “Under that third category, that person is often a senior careerist, but the Vacancies Reform Act doesn’t require them to be a careerist,” said Anne Joseph O’Connell, a Stanford law professor who specializes in issues related to appointments. “It can be a politically appointed person, so long as he has served 90 days in the department and is being paid at a sufficiently high level.” After an administration’s first year in office, an acting official appointed under the Vacancies Reform Act may serve up to 210 days. But Mr. Whitaker could serve longer than that while someone else’s nomination to be attorney general is pending. If the Senate were to reject that nomination, or if it returned the nomination without acting on it because the congressional session had ended, Mr. Trump could start the process over and Mr. Whitaker could serve another 210 days or longer. But Ms. O’Connell said that Mr. Trump could not nominate Mr. Whitaker himself because under the Vacancies Reform Act, an acting head of a department cannot be the nominee for that job. “There is something a little odd,” Ms. O’Connell said, “that this gap-filling measure allows putting someone who is not at a senior position, like a deputy, temporarily into one of the most important positions in the country.” Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter: @charlie_savage.

---split---16.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/midterms-trump-republicans-senate.html---split---Supported by The president made the midterms a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters. By Daniel McCarthy Mr. McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly. If Donald Trump inaugurated a new era of conflict in American politics, Tuesday’s midterm elections were just another skirmish, not a turning point in the war. Republicans lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than Democrats lost in 1994 or 2010, when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were in their first terms as president. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama both went on to win re-election two years after those midterm routs. And while Democrats also lost Senate seats in the first midterm elections under Presidents Clinton and Obama, Mr. Trump’s Republicans defied the historical trend by adding to their Senate majority. Democrats and other critics of President Trump argue that given the health of the economy, the failure of Republicans to do better than just keeping the Senate amounts to a damning verdict on this administration. Democrats and their supporters also boast about winning the “popular vote” for the House by a wide margin — by more than 8 percent, according to early estimates. Taken together, these claims are meant to show that Trumpism as a program and style of politics is unpopular, a drag on the Republican brand, and puts winning future elections into great doubt. The trouble for those who say this is that neither congressional nor presidential elections are decided by a national popular vote, and if anything, the results in 2018 have confirmed that Trumpism, or at least a Trump-led Republican Party, can indeed continue to win crucial presidential battleground states such as Florida and Ohio. If Mr. Trump were the abject failure that Democrats and some embittered former Republicans would like to believe, the Republicans should in fact have performed much worse on Tuesday, even with such a favorable economy. Indeed, if the administration were as incompetent and ideologically extreme as critics charge, the economy should not be doing well in the first place, some 22 months after Mr. Trump assumed office. Republicans on Tuesday did lose the governorship of Michigan, and they failed to win races for governor and the United States Senate in Pennsylvania. Those states, too, were part of Mr. Trump’s electoral map two years ago and are apt to be critical in 2020. Would the president be unable to win them again? Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania (who lost to the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey), was a staunch immigration restrictionist, just as the president is. But Mr. Barletta ran what was almost universally deemed a poor campaign, and he had nothing of the president’s star power or talent for exploiting an opponent’s weaknesses through well-chosen insults. Democrats’ successes in Pennsylvania suggest little about how a Democratic nominee will perform in the state against Mr. Trump in two years’ time. The same can be said, with a little less confidence, about Democrats’ midterm successes in other Upper Midwest contests. In an ordinary midterm election, turnout is low and the opposition party has an advantage, as is reflected in the long chronicle of losses for whichever party holds the White House at the time. In recent decades, only the 1998 and 2002 midterm elections were exceptions in which the president’s party gained seats. It’s easy to see why the president’s party is usually endangered: It has to defend the real record of a real leader, while the opposition party can criticize the president without having to offer an alternative. Strong criticism from one side and a necessarily weaker defense from the other is a formula for gains by the party out of power. That was still the case this year. Yet Mr. Trump did something unusual by increasing turnout among his defenders as well as his opponents. Republicans felt that Mr. Trump had an agenda still worth fighting for, and they were heartened that on several key issues — perhaps most important, judicial appointments — the president had delivered what he promised. That helped to make Tuesday a good night for political engagement overall, and it kept Republican losses below what they would have been if Mr. Trump had simply been an unpopular and polarizing figure. Mr. Trump made the election a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is indeed widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters — not only by those who are nationalists as the president is but by those, too, who are conventional Republicans who want lower taxes, fewer regulations and more conservative judges. Far from bringing about Mr. Trump’s repudiation, whether by a defeated and regretful right or by the country as a whole, the midterm election has only firmed up the lines of conflict for the future. President Trump will be at the center of that conflict, not as an aberration or departure from the norms of politics but as an integral part of the Republican Party — its head as well as its right arm.

Greg Gutfeld, who does a slightly older version of Jesse Watters’ every-white-guy schtick, is leaning so far back in his seat that I worry for a second that he might tip over. This man just does not care! When asked for his own final pre-results thoughts, Gutfeld announces that he is about to go get a drink. Watters forces out a laugh. Oh, Greg! 6:05 p.m.: Honestly, nice set. Good-looking chairs, lots of red, white and blue. Wolf Blitzer, eat your heart out. The core group isn’t the worst Fox News has on offer. The relatively straightforward duo of Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum appears to be at the helm tonight with Chris Wallace and Brit Hume offering insight on either side. Kind of a Republican Party circa 2004 feel going on? Should I be cautiously optimistic this won’t devolve into a night of coded talk of “America’s changing demographics”? Because I am not cautiously optimistic. Tune in to Fox News Channel NOW for special #Midterms2018 coverage anchored by @BretBaier and @MarthaMacCallum. https://t.co/vLvu9Z7Jvm pic.twitter.com/MwhbXyjUhL 6:15 p.m.: Chris Wallace points out that if Republican Andy Barr wins his race in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, the “red wall gets a little redder,” while if Democrat Amy McGrath wins, “the wave gets a little bluer.” Primary colors. Rudimentary metaphors. This is the kind of cable news analysis I crave. 6:22 p.m. Bill Hemmer is at one of those interactive screens, and he is noting that tonight they will be closely watching the race between Republican Denver Riggleman and Democrat Leslie Cockburn in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. Donald Trump endorsed Riggleman and won the district by 11 points in 2016, which naturally leads to two questions and two questions only: “Is he still that popular again this year? Or has he increased his popularity?” 6:26 p.m.: Harris Faulkner is introducing something called the “Key House Race Tracker.” As far as I understand it, the Key House Race Tracker helps you track key House races, but in a way that makes it feel like sports! Who doesn’t like sports. Not Faulkner, and I know that because she just said, “We love the NFL on Fox, you know that” while describing a yellow line in the middle as a “yard line.” She adds that you can look at what’s near that middle line and understand which races are closest. “My husband loves that. I don’t even have to speak and he knows the score of the game,” she cracks. .@HARRISFAULKNER has a look at the key House races as the polls begin to close on #ElectionDay. https://t.co/tH1ocNmSM1 pic.twitter.com/3ZsFx3a9Rb 6:34 p.m.: OK, we’re suddenly cutting to “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy, who is at a bar in Missouri where he is ready to talk to some regular beer-loving Americans. “America needs a drink,” Doocy laughs. Haha, definitely! The only problem is the bar is not very full at all. Of the three women Doocy interviews, two are voting for incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. This woman, however, did not vote for McCaskill: 6:42 p.m.: Laura Ingraham, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Marie Harf are on stage now. Honestly, not minding the conversation among the latter three. But I’m having trouble following Ingraham, who is explaining that there are two camps in this country: “one that feels really battered and abused by the mainstream media” and another made up of people who want “payback” and to “send a message: that even though the economy might be doing well, we don’t like the way we feel.” 6:54 p.m.: Oh, hell yeah. Let’s hear from some men on the street. Chad from South Carolina is worried about “open borders,” and Tom’s main issue is “the polls have been wrong all along and people are not getting the facts out.” Then the camera turns down and we meet Phoenix from Texas, a young and intrepid “kid reporter” with a great hat who believes Beto O’Rourke is too left for his state. The Fox News interviewer responds: “I’ve got two words for you: You’re hired.” Everyone laughs. 7:12 p.m.: Brit Hume is trying to help viewers understand how it could possibly be that Trump’s tax bill is unpopular with Americans when the economy is great. The answer, he says, is not that the tax bill didn’t work as promised but that Republicans didn’t sell the it well. “It is a trap that Republicans fall into every time,” he says, before adding: “The rich didn’t do well in this tax cut. It was very much a middle-class tax cut.” Is that true? Who knows. 7:15 p.m.: OK, wow. It’s starting to get much more Fox Newsy up in here. There is suddenly a sense of nervousness in the studio, and Ingraham just took control of the conversation to say that “the Democrats are better at the emotional anecdote, tugging at your heartstrings ― the kid who can’t get his procedure covered by insurance.” “It is very emotional, and people like emotion, it is good,” Ingraham explains. Emotion, it is good. 7:24 p.m.: Bret Baier is now interviewing former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell. The conversation seems fairly civil until Rendell suddenly says Trump “shouldn’t be talking about a made-up caravan,” adding, “Nobody with half a brain ―” before Baier cuts him off so quickly that for a second I thought Rendell had dropped an f-bomb. “There is actually a caravan,” Baier exclaims. “But [it’s] only an issue in President Trump’s mind,” Rendell replies. “These people are not trying to get into the country illegally. They’re seeking asylum.” The guest appears to be making dangerous amounts of sense, and Baier changes the topic, asking Rendell if he thinks Democrats should investigate the president if they take over the House of Representatives or focus on legislation. 7:33 p.m.: Interesting poll out of Georgia. Appears voter suppression was not an issue! Everybody move on. 7:39 p.m.: Steve Hilton, who was once an adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, is saying that this election is going to turn into “style versus substance.” Unsurprisingly, it appears the Democrats are the “style” in this metaphor. Hilton is arguing that, unlike regular Americans, wealthy Democrats don’t have to worry about money, so they can focus on the president’s personality ― “what he says, how he behaves,” etc. “I have a feeling what we are going to see is the Revenge of the Elites,” he predicts. 8:02 p.m.: Within seconds of calling the Illinois gubernatorial race for Democrat J.B. Pritzker, Martha MacCallum notes that he will become “the richest governor, actually, in U.S. history.” Question: Why is it that when a Democrat is rich, he’s an “elite,” but when a Republican is rich, he’s “successful”? The correct answer is: Who cares. It’s time for class war. 8:07 p.m: Things are looking good for the Dems, and Fox News is bringing in the big boy, Tucker Carlson, for some expert analysis. It seems as if Andrew Gillum might eke out a victory in Florida, and Tucker, like you, wants to know how exactly this atrocity could have come to pass. Sure, he’ll now admit, Ron DeSantis kind of sucks. But what else? “Immigration has changed Florida in a very recognizable way,” he says. “The California of 30 years ago was solidly Republican. So was Florida. They now have different people in them.” What kind of people could he be talking about? I have no idea. He also notes that ― wait, could this be? He’s pointing out that the “hard left” politics of Gillum might be more popular than previously assumed, since a lot of young people are living with their parents, etc. Of course, as we all know, universal health care is a “ludicrous” idea, he says, adding: “There’s no way to pay for that.” But, he continues: Maybe the hard-left economic issues are a little bit more popular than we want to think they are. I think that’s ominous. But that doesn’t make it any less true. Beto O’Rourke, for example, I think will probably lose tonight, but he’s coming a lot closer than he should in the state of Texas. Again two causes: Immigration has changed the demographics in Texas, and two, some of this populist economic stuff is more popular, again, than we want to think it is. This has to be the closest we’ll get to a Fox News panic button. 8:14 p.m.: “I disagree with much of what he says, but I think he’s a very attractive guy,” Brit Hume says of Andrew Gillum. 8:39 p.m.: Just as I find myself getting bored, Laura Ingraham wakes me back up. This time she’s mad about the rich Democratic elites ― ActBlue and Tom Steyer (not George Soros this time; who knows why). These elites threw “millions” into the Florida gubernatorial race, and we can all agree, again, that DeSantis kind of sucks. So should that loser win, Ingraham argues, “I gotta say it’s all Donald Trump who won this for him.” 9:00 p.m.: POLLS CLOSED IN 14 MORE STATES! BASED ON THE GRAPHICS THIS IS VERY EXCITING NEWS! I AM GETTING TIRED!!! 9:09 p.m.: “Don’t discount the power of Rick Scott” is a sentence I never thought I’d hear, but hear it I did, just now, courtesy of Laura Ingraham. She is talking about Florida, and now that Gillum appears to be fading, he is suddenly too “far left” for Florida, even though he almost won. Seems a little confusing, but she’s the expert, not me. 9:17 p.m.: Well, helloooo, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who is very excited to talk about Republican Mike Braun winning a Senate seat in Indiana. It appears this is the main victory we are excited about tonight. Check out the excitement: Between Hume and Rove, you could make an entire “McLaughlin Group” panel out of all the jowl on set tonight. 9:25 p.m.: Whoa, celeb sighting. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is joining us from just outside the White House, and she wants to let everyone watching Fox News to know that the president’s actually had “an incredible night.” “You’re seeing Americans come out and unanimously say that they are proud of this president and proud of what he’s done in these two years,” she says. This is welcome insight, since the needle at the bottom right of the screen currently gives the Democrats an 84 percent chance of taking back the House of Representatives. 9:33 p.m.: Whoops, sorry, Sarah: Fox News has just called the House for the Democrats, and Chris Wallace is guessing that a lot of people’s heads are “exploding” at this exact moment, which is maybe the fairest and most balanced analysis I’ve heard tonight. 9:44 p.m.: We’re back with Steve Doocy at the bar, which is now incredibly full with what I can only assume is a representative sample of the Missouri electorate, considering this tweet is the reason most of them are there: Hey Springfield, Missouri! We are going LIVE from Patton Alley Pub in Springfield, stop by and talk to us starting at 5pm Central! 🍺 #mosen #midterms2018 Doocy starts to poll the entire audience. Who here voted for Claire McCaskill? A few people clap in the back. How about Josh Hawley? Raucous applause. Who here cares about health care? Near silence. The economy? Raucous applause. Kavanaugh? Raucous applause. How about the CARAVAN!? A few uncomfortable claps. 9:53 p.m.: My girlfriend looks tired and a little depressed, so I switch the TV to CNN for a few minutes. 9:56 p.m.: OK, she’s asleep now, so I switch back, and Mike Braun is giving his victory speech. Yes, he is the star of the night, or at least the hour. 10:04 p.m.: Laura Ingraham, the woman gets your attention. I was kind of losing interest and then she threw out the words “the constant demonization of the president as racist, as Hitler, as anti-Semitic and everything you can think of.” I’m not sure why exactly she said that, but I know I’m now listening, and we’re talking about Florida and Georgia. Ingraham proclaims that if both states go Republican, “Oprah, Obama, the entire mainstream media have a huge amount of egg on their face.” 10:11 p.m.: Hold on, we have ourselves an old-school cable news showdown! Laura Ingraham says that Trump has been unfairly portrayed as a “combination of Stalin, Hitler and every tyrant that ever lived.” Juan Williams is saying that “if the media was fair, they would call Trump out on his lies.” Ingraham appears mildly annoyed!!! 10:15 p.m. Mike Braun, crown jewel, is now being interviewed. What are the things that really rile him up? “Balancing our budget” and “fiscal integrity.” Hell yeah. 10:22 p.m.: After a few minutes of everyone pumping Donald Trump up, Chris Wallace works the brakes. “We are overstating a little bit the importance, not the importance, but giving too much credit to Donald Trump for holding on to the Senate. The fact is, this is a historically difficult year for the Democrats.” Are we sure Wallace gets invited to his co-workers’ birthday parties? 10:25 p.m.: It appears hard-left-communist-agitator-slash-Democrat Beto O’Rourke has lost, and Karl Rove is suddenly explaining why with jowly condescension. “If he had understood he is running in a red state he might’ve had a better shot,” Rove says, adding that O’Rourke must have been an idiot to take radical positions like supporting the right of NFL players to peacefully protest. “He systematically alienated any shot he had at getting any moderate, independent vote,” Rove says, “unless they just really didn’t like Ted Cruz at all.” 10:28 p.m.: Just realized it’s the 10 o’clock hour, which makes this Ingraham prime time, and I realize that because Ingraham is currently in possession of her second showdown of the last 30 minutes, this time with Chris Wallace. Ingraham is saying Cruz probably won because Trump went down there and that Donald Trump Jr. had a big effect on the midterms. That kind of stuff. “The party is coming home to Trump. The party is unified,” says the news anchor. Meanwhile, she argues, the Democrats are having an Ocasio-Cortez party. Get it? They are socialists now. “I don’t think that’s fair to say about the Democrats. That’s a complete mischaracterization,” argues Chris Wallace. She seems to start to interrupt him. He says, “Laura…” She says, “Chris…” They keep it cool enough, but you can tell. You can always tell. 10:35 p.m.: The situation had looked a little dire for Republicans an hour or so ago, but things are picking up for them now. Coincidentally, the mood of the room at Fox News has improved. Republican Lindsey Graham is videoing in to explain why Republicans “won.” “The reasons we won is I think Kavanaugh united our party, the caravan was an affront to our sovereignty, the economy was good and President Trump worked his butt off to get out the Republican base vote,” he says. Then, like Lynyrd Skynyrd finishing off a set with “Free Bird,” Graham returns to Kavanaugh. Thanks to an assist from Bret Baier, he calls the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing “despicable” and “a Democratic debacle.” “This was a good man that had his life ruined,” says Graham of a man who was confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Supreme Court literally last month. 11:07 p.m.: Brit Hume is discussing the handsome 38-year-old Republican Josh Hawley’s defeat of Claire McCaskill in Missouri. “Josh Hawley emerges as a star on the national scene,” he says. “I wonder if he will get more publicity than Beto O’Rourke now that he won and O’Rourke lost. I kind of doubt it,” he says before launching into something that I suppose technically could be described as a laugh. 11:11 p.m.: For at least the second time tonight, someone on Fox News has implied the caravan is a manufactured controversy meant to drum up Republican anger. Last time it was Ed Rendell; this time it was Juan Williams. And just like last time, Bret Baier has jumped in like an umpire to let the world know that the caravan is real. “The caravan is real,” he says. “It is there.” Williams begins to explain that Trump has depicted the caravan of migrants as “gang members about to force their way through our borders” before the conversation turns to whether the House Democrats will “investigate or legislate.” 11:16 p.m.: Juan Williams and Brit Hume seem to be fighting, but honestly I’m too tired to even try and deduce what it is they are fighting about. Something about Trump. You can assume. 11:41 p.m.: I just realized I fell asleep for 25 minutes. Right after I wake up, Bret Baier pulls out a line about “investigation after investigation,” and I wish I hadn’t. 11:44 p.m.: We cut to a Josh Hawley victory speech, then a Rick Scott victory speech, then a Ron DeSantis victory speech. It appears that the Republicans have saved the country, buoyed by Donald Trump against the various attempts by the Democratic Party to sink our once-great nation. We have been saved once more, and I am going to bed.
---split---17.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-trump-investigations_us_5be31530e4b0dbe871a5eba8---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: After Democrats won control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, President Donald Trump will face actual oversight from Congress for the first time. His most controversial policies will immediately come under investigation ― as will the scandals that circled the first two years of his presidency. Trump’s family separation policy, efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, rollbacks of environmental regulations, the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, the issuance of security clearances to Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, voter suppression and the president’s potential violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause all top the list of Democrats’ oversight plans. They also plan to obtain Trump’s tax returns. “I plan to shine a light on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Trump Administration,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement. “I want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money, as well as President Trump’s decisions to act in his own financial self-interest rather than the best interests of the American people.” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the vice-ranking member of the oversight committee, told HuffPost by phone Wednesday it’s a target-rich environment following a “complete desert of oversight under the Republican watch” for the last two years. The challenge for Democrats, he said, will be to “prioritize and whittle down” that list of oversight priorities during the first few months in order to focus on “high-profile, impactful areas of examination where we can make a difference.” House Oversight Committee Democrats already had a list of 50-plus subpoenas they want filed prior to the election. The committee will now look to focus its attention on investigating the president’s conflicts of interest and how his son-in-law obtained a security clearance while providing oversight of the 2020 Census. The oversight committee, along with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, will also finally be able to file subpoenas with the General Services Administration about Trump’s hotel in Washington, D.C., a huge target for scandals during the first half of Trump’s term in office. Democrats will also wield the gavel of the powerful House Judiciary Committee where they plan to provide actual oversight of Trump’s nativist immigration agenda. The committee will investigate how the president’s family separation policy came to be and how it has been administered. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman, announced on Nov. 2 that he wanted answers about the president’s deployment of U.S. troops to the Mexico border to repel a caravan of migrants seeking asylum from Central American countries. The committee also plans to open an investigation into the rise of right-wing, white supremacist terrorism across the country. In the final weeks before the election, a Trump fanatic mailed bombs to Democratic Party political figures the president labeled his enemies, a racist shooter killed black shoppers after trying to enter a black church and an anti-Semite whipped up by fears of the migrant caravan killed 11 at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Committee Democrats also want to examine why the administration decided not to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in the courts. The Democratic oversight agenda is already changing before they even pick up their gavels. Attorney General Jeff Sessions submitted his resignation at the request of President Trump on Wednesday. His replacement, acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker, took control of overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the president’s 2016 campaign. Whitaker is a critic of the Mueller investigation who previously suggested a temporary Sessions replacement could halt the investigation without firing Mueller: “He just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.” Nadler, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman, said he will investigate the circumstances of this personnel change in January. “Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation?” Nadler said in a tweet. “We will be holding people accountable.” Mueller could release more indictments of Trump campaign officials or family members. This could prompt Trump to issue pardons. If any of these events came to pass in the lame-duck period, Democrats acknowledge that they will have to investigate. The fact that Trump will finally face oversight from a body with subpoena power is already raising his ire. If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game! Trump and his Republican allies have begun to frame Congress’ constitutional oversight role as some form of extrajudicial attack on the presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) began referring to House Democrats’ plan to actually behave as a co-equal branch of government as “presidential harassment” on Wednesday. Trump, as he so often does, levied an empty threat on Twitter that Senate Republicans will investigate House Democrats “for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else.” It is unclear if the president does not know that the Senate cannot investigate the House. Rep. Connolly said that Trump’s “empty threat” shows he’s “in some denial” about what happened on Tuesday. “When you lose one of the chambers of the United States Congress in a midterm like this, and you look at how he lost it and where, it ought to be of great concern,” he said. “You’re not going to get the free ride you got these last two years.” “We got a mandate last night to provide the oversight and accountability that has been sorely lacking, and we’re going to take that mandate seriously,” he added. This has been updated to reflect Jeff Sessions’ resignation on Wednesday. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.
---split---17.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/midterm-wave-came-undertow-gop-trump---split---As Donald Trump in the White House fulfills every dire prophecy about his vitriolic fear mongering, affluent suburbs are increasingly becoming part of the permanent Democratic coalition. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) OPINION — It was the most important midterm election since voters repudiated the unsteady hand of Herbert Hoover in responding to the Great Depression. But unlike 1930 when the Democrats garnered more than 50 House seats and gained effective control of the Senate, the electoral verdict last night was far more equivocal. As anyone who spent last summer at the beach knows, waves come in all sizes. There are gentle waves made for diving seven-year-olds. There are deceptively strong waves that bring with them an undertow. And there are, of course, fierce storm waves that require a response from FEMA. Republicans, from Donald Trump on down, will dismiss last night’s Democratic victories as a wave worthy of a kiddie pool. Already, the early-rising Trump tweeted about “our Big Victory last night.” And, in terms of the Senate where at least three and maybe five Democratic incumbents lost, there is a rationale to the Trumpian hyperbole. Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!  But, in truth, the 2018 midterms appear to have brought with them a lasting Democratic undertow. Looking at the House map from Portland, Maine, to the North Carolina border, only by squinting do you see occasional small splotches of red in places like Long Island. Across the board, Republicans had problems in upmarket, mostly white, congressional districts from Charleston, South Carolina, to Oklahoma City. The new Democratic House majority — and the almost certain return of Nancy Pelosi as speaker — represents a triumph over gerrymandering. Not too long ago political orthodoxy decreed that the Republicans would control the House until after the 2020 Census because the district lines were so artfully drawn by the GOP after the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 elections. Instead, the 2018 House elections were a belated vindication of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 strategy of pitching herself to college-educated suburban Republican women. These women were Clinton’s target audience when she maladroitly described half of Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables” because of their “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic” views. As Trump in the White House fulfills every dire prophecy about his vitriolic fear mongering, affluent suburbs are increasingly becoming part of the permanent Democratic coalition. Republican incumbents who survived 2018 in districts like Ohio-12 (the Columbus suburbs) and Pennsylvania-1 (Philadelphia suburbs) have reason to be fearful of increased Democratic turnout in the presidential year of 2020. Trump also tweeted on Wednesday morning “To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!" As a pundit fearful of the ire of a press critic like Trump, I will happily give him proper credit for losing the House. To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!  The Democrats faced the most daunting Senate map in memory with only nine GOP-held seats on the ballot. Trump responded with fact-free rallies designed to stoke fear of a dwindling caravan of desperate asylum-seekers hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. And it worked in states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri — none of which will be in play in the 2020 presidential election. That said, Democrats still face a moment of reckoning in understanding Trump’s continuing appeal. The president’s support level a bit above the 40 percent mark remains impervious to anything less than nuclear weapons. In fact, the Democrats’ apparent 8- to 9-point edge in the national House vote lines up neatly with Trump’s approval ratings. A national rebellion against Trump might have elected matinee-idol candidates like Beto O’Rourke in the Texas Senate race and Andrew Gillum in Florida’s gubernatorial contest. But demographic change in politics often comes more slowly than the fantasies of hopeful partisans. When the 116th Congress convenes in January, no one should waste too much time analyzing potential legislation. With a House majority, the Democrats have the power to block any further assaults on Obamacare. But it seems fanciful to believe that a divided Congress will produce anything beyond maintaining the basic housekeeping functions of government. Since, unlike the Trump-era Republicans, the Democrats remain a big-tent party, Pelosi in normal times might have problems managing her small House majority. But what matters in the new House will be committee chairmanships and subpoena powers rather than floor votes. And when it comes to organizing the House, even a single-vote margin is sufficient. It is impossible to know whether vigorous investigations of the Trump regime will pay political dividends to the Democrats. But after two years of supine Republican see-no-evil under-sight of the government, the Democrats’ ability to deploy the power to probe will restore Congress’ constitutional role as an independent branch of government. With an enhanced Senate majority, Mitch McConnell will have even greater latitude to reshape the federal judiciary with conservative jurists. In fact, by 2020, any member of the right-wing Federalist Society who is not a federal judge will have ample grounds to be embarrassed for being passed over. At some point, though, those Republicans with a sense of decency and a belief in truth-telling will have to look in the mirror and contemplate the costs of being a Trump congressional enabler. Nothing about the 2018 election should give Republicans the confidence that marching in lockstep with Trump puts them on the right side of history. But for the moment, the Democrats are entitled to a deep sigh of relief. While it was not an Election Night of candy canes and elves prancing on the Capitol lawn, it was good enough to constrain Donald Trump. And that alone made it the most important midterm since 1930.

USA TODAY President Donald Trump is pictured with Jeff Sessions during the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony in Quantico, Virginia. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday after a year of intense scrutiny from the White House. Sessions' exit, a resignation forced by Trump, was expected for weeks amid Trump's attacks over his attorney general's decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump also named the attorney general's chief of staff Matthew Whitaker to serve as interim attorney general. Sessions' departure came after a fiery Trump press conference one day after the midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House. Here's what we know now. Even though Sessions was one of Trump's earliest supporters, the president has been laser-focused on targeting Sessions, going as far as to appearing to completely disassociate Sessions with the administration. More: Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions, names Matthew Whitaker as interim replacement "I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad," Trump said in an interview with Hill.TV in September. "I'm not happy at the border, I'm not happy with numerous things, not just this." Trump has attacked Sessions in interviews, tweets, and press conferences as "beleaguered" and often expressing "disappointment" in his attorney general. So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? Sessions' ouster immediately moves oversight of the ongoing investigation to interim successor Whitaker, who once called for the inquiry to be dramatically scaled back. Sessions recused himself from the probe in March 2017 for failing to disclose election-year meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. That – and Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey in May – prompted the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as the Justice Department’s special counsel to direct the inquiry. With Whitaker at the helm, it was not immediately clear what it meant for Mueller's future. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been overseeing the probe, was at the White House Wednesday for what administration officials described as a previously scheduled meeting. Whitaker, a former football player in Iowa who rose there to become a federal prosecutor and chief of staff at the Justice Department, had been considered for a variety of jobs in the Trump administration. Among Whitaker's possible posts included No. 2 at Justice or as White House counsel. Whitaker had served as Sessions’ chief of staff since October 2017. More: Who is Matthew Whitaker? Hawkeye football star and federal prosecutor becomes acting attorney general Whitaker, in a 2017 article published by CNN before joining the Justice Department, called on Rosenstein to "limit the scope" of Mueller's investigation and block review of Trump's family finances. Whitaker also wrote a column for USA TODAY on July 5, 2016, that said he would have indicted Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president that year, for handling classified documents as secretary of State on a private email server. In a resignation letter sent to the president, Sessions thanked Trump "for the opportunity" to be attorney general. He also listed what he considered his accomplishments during his tenure. "Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country," Sessions wrote. "I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice." More: White House departures: Who's been fired and who resigned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed to protect Mueller, saying it would create a constitutional crisis if Session’s departure were a prelude to ending, or greatly limiting, Mueller’s investigation. "I find the timing very suspect," Schumer said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump's move a clear effort to derail Mueller's probe.

USA TODAY Here are the notable firings and resignations of the Trump administration, starting with the most recent departure: The day after a bitter midterm election, President Trump announced his attorney general Jeff Sessions would no longer serve in his administration. Sessions' firing was no surprise as he'd long been a primary target of the president due to his recusal from heading the special counsel investigation on Russia meddling. The White House counsel, who had extraordinary access to President Donald Trump during some of his most controversial dealings and decisions, will leave his post this fall, the president announced in a tweet. After months of allegations of misconduct, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency handed in his resignation. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who headed up the president's efforts to to ramp up immigration arrests and crack down on sanctuary cities, announced his plans to retire in June. The homeland security adviser resigned a day after John Bolton took over as national security adviser. The announcement of the Obama administration holdover's departure came via tweet, after weeks of speculation about his fate. The departure of the national security adviser appeared to be amicable, with each releasing written statements thanking each other. The deputy director of the FBI was set to retire in just a matter of days when Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to fire him. After months of friction, the secretary of State was bumped from his position. According to a statement from the State Department, Tillerson had not spoken to the president and was not aware of the reason for his dismissal. President Trump's personal assistant was abruptly fired over what was described as security reasons. The head of the National Economic Council announced plans to resign from the administration, amid a fierce internal debate over proposed tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum. The White House communications director announced her resignation and that she would be leaving in the coming weeks or months. She took on her role in August and has been one of Trump's longest-serving aides. Porter's resignation as the White House staff secretary came after domestic abuse allegations against him were made public. Newman, who rose to notoriety when she was on The Apprentice with Trump, was left her job in the White House's Office of Public Liaison. She later denied that she had been fired or escorted from White House grounds, though the Secret Service did say it terminated her access. Trump's deputy national security adviser, who was a driving force behind the president's Middle East policy, announced her plans to depart the administration in 2018, the White House announced in December. The Health and Human Services secretary resigned after revelations that he had racked up around $400,000 in private flights while traveling on official business. When the controversial counterterrorism adviser stepped down, he said Trump's populist campaign agenda had been hijacked by establishment figures. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. The chief strategist, who had a turbulent time at the White House, left his post after pressure to remove him from his post following violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va. For his part, Bannon said he resigned two weeks prior. The controversial communications director stepped down after 11 days on the job, the same day John Kelly took over as chief of staff. In his six-month tenure, marked by staff infighting and political reversals, the chief of staff was often a target of Trump loyalists who said he had failed to help the president win congressional legislation. The senior assistant press secretary, brought on by Priebus, resigned after Scaramucci said he was going to fire him for allegedly leaking to the press. The press secretary's tumultuous tenure, marked by standoffs with the press, culminated in his resignation when Trump went against his advice to hire Scaramucci as his new communications director. The director of the Office of Government Ethics clashed repeatedly with the president before announcing his resignation. Trump's first communications director did not work on the Trump campaign and did not know Trump before his hire. He handed in his resignation after three months on the job. The White House initially said the FBI director's firing was based on the Justice Department's recommendation, over his handling of the Clinton email probe. Since then, Trump has said he had considered firing Comey even without that recommendation and has said the Russia investigation was on his mind when he made the decision. The chief usher was fired for unclear reasons; it is unusual for a chief usher to be dismissed and they typically hold their positions for several years and over a number of administrations. The national security adviser was mired in controversy after news reports surfaced that he had misled officials, including Vice President Pence, about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He resigned shortly afterward. The acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, was dismissed after she refused to defend the first iteration of Trump's travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) WASHINGTON — The White House revoked the press badge of CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta Wednesday following a tense exchange with President Donald Trump where the president called him a "rude, terrible person." White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced the unexpected move Wednesday evening, explaining the decision was a result of both Acosta's behavior and him yanking back when a White House intern tried to take his microphone. "President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration," Sanders said. "We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern." The move is just the latest in the president's escalating war against the news media, which he blamed Wednesday as one of the reasons Republicans fell short in midterm elections. While news organizations and certain reporters have been barred from events, Acosta is almost certainly the most high-profile reporter to be barred from doing his job in the Trump-era. Sanders said the "conduct is absolutely unacceptable" and Acosta's refusal to pass the microphone was "completely disrespectful to the reporter’s colleagues" as it was not allowing them an opportunity to ask questions. "As a result of today’s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice," Sanders said.

Acosta, who says he's had the credentials for five years covering both the Obama and Trump presidencies, said he was denied entrance while he attempted to get onto the grounds for a 8 p.m. show. "It was a pretty surreal experience," Acosta said on CNN, reacting to the news. "I never thought in this country that I wouldn't be able to go and cover the President of the United States simply because I was trying to ask him a question." Journalists assigned to cover the White House apply for passes that allow them daily access to press areas in the West Wing. White House staff decide whether journalists are eligible, though the Secret Service determines whether their applications are approved. Earlier in the day, Trump refused to answer a follow-up question from Acosta after the midterm races showed Democrats would take control of the House. Acosta persisted in attempting to ask the president about the Russia investigation into interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump spoke loudly over Acosta – with whom he has clashed repeatedly – and demanded he hand over the microphone to White House staff.

Buzz60 "You should let me run the country. You run CNN," the president told Acosta. Trump stepped away from the lectern, appearing as though Acosta's behavior would end the news conference. He returned to the microphone as Acosta sat down. "I tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them," Trump said. "You are a rude terrible person." CNN stood up for Acosta, in a statement saying, "This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American." Sanders called CNN's statement "outrageous." "The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration," she said in a statement. The White House Correspondents Association released a statement Wednesday saying it “strongly objects to the Trump Administration’s decision to use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship. Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable.” The WHCA called on the White House to “immediately reverse this weak and misguided action.” President Trump is continuing to air his grievances against the press, calling them "the fake, fake disgusting news." He told a rally crowd in Pennsylvania on Thursday that the media refuses to give him credit for a long list of accomplishments. (Aug. 2) AP The White House revoking a reporter's press badge capped off one whirlwind of a Wednesday. In the morning, the president attempted to downplay the Democratic takeover of the House and what that would mean for him. He took aim at several reporters during his afternoon news conference. Then, hours later fired his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, possibly leaving the future of the Russia investigation in jeopardy. Since campaigning for president, Trump has been at odds with the news media. He coined the phrase "fake news media" and has targeted certain reporters and outlets consistently over his two years in the White House. There have been tense moments in the Trump White House where certain outlets and reporters were barred from individual events, including near the start of his presidency where CNN, the New York Times and other prominent outlets were barred from a briefing but allowed reporters from conservative outlets. CNN White House reporter Kaitlan Collins said she was banned from a White House event in July after attempting to ask the president a series of questions that were deemed "inappropriate."

---split---18.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/trump-sessions-whitaker-mueller.html---split---Opinion In forcing out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the president seems to want a lawman he can control. CreditCreditEric Thayer for The New York Times Supported by By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Robert Mueller, the special counsel, always knew he was running the Russia investigation on borrowed time. That time may have just run out on Wednesday afternoon, when President Trump ousted his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, less than 24 hours after Republicans lost their eight-year lock on the House of Representatives. So who’s going to protect Mr. Mueller now? Until Wednesday, the job was being performed ably by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who assumed oversight of the Russia investigation when Mr. Sessions recused himself in March 2017. Under Mr. Rosenstein’s leadership, the investigation Mr. Mueller took over has resulted in the felony conviction of the president’s former campaign chairman, guilty pleas from multiple other top Trump aides and associates and the indictments of dozens of Russian government operatives for interfering in the 2016 election. For more than a year, Mr. Rosenstein walked a political tightrope, guarding Mr. Mueller’s independence on the one hand while trying to appease Mr. Trump’s increasingly meddlesome demands on the other. That task now falls to Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who on Wednesday became acting attorney general and, far more alarmingly, the man Mr. Mueller now reports to. The good news is that no one, including Mr. Whitaker, can stop the multiple prosecutions or litigation already in progress — including the cooperation of Paul Manafort; the sentencing of Michael Flynn; or the continuing investigation of Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, and the Trump Organization by federal prosecutors in New York. The courts will have the final say on what happens in each of those cases. Democrats will also soon be running the House, returning it to its place as a coequal branch of government and holding Mr. Trump to account for the first time since he took office. “We are immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction,” Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who is expected to soon head the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday. The bad news is, well, pretty much everything else. Mr. Whitaker — who has been called the “eyes and ears” of the White House inside the Justice Department by John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff — has expressed a Trumpian degree of hostility to the investigation he is now charged with overseeing. He has called it a “witch hunt” and, in its earliest months, wrote an opinion piece arguing that Mr. Mueller was coming “dangerously close” to crossing a “red line” by investigating the president’s finances. He has suggested there was nothing wrong in Mr. Trump’s 2017 firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, and he has supported the prosecution of Hillary Clinton. In an interview last year he described “a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn’t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.” In 2014, he headed the political campaign for Iowa state treasurer of Sam Clovis, who later became a Trump campaign aide and, more recently, a witness in the Russia investigation. Conflicts of interest like this are what led Mr. Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. That was the ethical thing to do, even if it sent Mr. Trump into a spiral of rage. Mr. Sessions, a veteran of the Senate, is an institutionalist at heart. “The Department of Justice,” he once said, “will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.” That sentiment was never going to survive long under Mr. Trump, for whom improper influence has been a central plank of governing philosophy. Ethics, not so much. The irony is that Mr. Sessions was among the president’s most effective and loyal foot soldiers. Soon after becoming attorney general, he turned Mr. Trump’s cartoonish law-and-order campaign talk into reality by directing federal prosecutors to bring the harshest charges possible in all cases. He helped obliterate the legacy of President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump’s predecessor and nemesis, by pushing to scale back or end policies that Mr. Obama had championed, including legal protections for the 700,000 young immigrants who came to the United States as children. But personal loyalty is what Mr. Trump really cares about, and on that count Mr. Sessions failed spectacularly. If Mr. Whitaker has any concern for the independence of the department he is taking over — not to mention the rule of law in America — he will follow Mr. Sessions’s lead and hand the reins of the investigation to someone less evidently invested in destroying it. It’s not even clear Mr. Whitaker may legally hold the post of acting attorney general, since he has never been confirmed by the Senate. But if so, he could do a lot of damage, much of it behind closed doors. For example, he could tip off the White House to what the special counsel's office is up to, or he could block Mr. Mueller from taking significant investigatory steps, like bringing an indictment, without having to notify Congress or the public until the investigation is complete. And any report Mr. Mueller ultimately submits goes directly to the attorney general — who may decide whether or not to pass it along to Congress. Mr. Trump has made clear that he thinks the attorney general should function as a president’s personal lawyer, protecting him from justice and persecuting his enemies. In the days before Mr. Sessions recused himself last year, Mr. Trump tried desperately to stop him, at one point complaining, “Where’s my Roy Cohn?” He was referring to the infamous mob lawyer and fixer who had mentored him as a young man before dying in 1986. The president may believe that in Mr. Whitaker he’s found his Roy Cohn. He may also believe that the Republican majority in the Senate — increased on Tuesday with likely Trump loyalists — is prepared to embrace such a corrupted standard for American justice. So it’s a good moment to recall another figure from that era — Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, who said in the aftermath of the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, “Whether we shall continue to be a government of laws, and not of men, is now for Congress and ultimately the American people.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.

USA TODAY Ongoing tension between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and President Donald Trump flared up again Wednesday during a post-election news conference. Trump refused to answer a follow-up question from Acosta, who persisted in his attempt to ask the president about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. A White House aide tried to take the microphone from Acosta, but the reporter kept it.

CNN’s Jim Acosta Karate Chops White House Staff Member While Refusing To Give Up Mic pic.twitter.com/xc8KEswftC Hours later, the White House announced that Acosta is losing his press credentials. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced the move Wednesday evening, explaining it was a result of both Acosta's behavior and him yanking back when a White House employee tried to his microphone. This wasn't the first time Trump and White House officials clashed with Acosta, whose network is a frequent target of "fake news" attacks from the administration. Here's a brief history of other times the reporter and the White House have butted heads. During a news conference amid the Supreme Court confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh in September, Acosta suggested the president should call on a female reporter to ask questions about the sexual misconduct allegations against the nominee. "What does it mean," Trump responded, clearly irked. Acosta said he thought it was important for a woman to ask a question about the accusations about Kavanaugh. "I wouldn't mind that at all," Trump then replied. "It wouldn't make any difference to me." With Trump frequently referring to the press as the "enemy of the people," Acosta pressed Sanders to say definitely whether she agrees. Acosta's question came after Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump said she does not believe the press is the enemy of the people. Sanders wouldn't answer the question directly during the August news conference, and said the media went after her personally. "As far as I know I'm the first press secretary in the history of the United States who has required Secret Service protection," Sanders said. Acosta walked out of the conference and tweeted, "I am totally saddened by what just happened." I walked out of the end of that briefing because I am totally saddened by what just happened. Sarah Sanders was repeatedly given a chance to say the press is not the enemy and she wouldn't do it. Shameful. During the family-friendly annual Easter egg roll at the White House, Acosta shouted questions toward Trump about the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program. "What about the DACA kids? Should they worry about what's going to happen to them?" Acosta shouted, per pool reports. President Trump replied that Democrats had "let them down," but didn't reply to a follow-up question. Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, criticized Acosta for the exchange, to which Acosta replied, "Just doing my job ... which is protected by the First Amendment of The Constitution." Acosta pressed Trump during a brief exchange in the wake of the deadly Charlottesville attack. Acosta wanted Trump to hold a fuller news conference after the attack (a day later, he held one in Trump Tower), but Trump said he had just held a conference (he merely made some remarks and signed a memorandum on Chinese trade practices). "Can we ask you some more questions then, sir?" Acosta asked. Trump replied: "It doesn't bother me at all, but, you know, I like real news. Not fake news. You're fake news. Thank you everybody." During a press conference tied to an immigration proposal, White House adviser Stephen Miller and Acosta had a long debate over immigration in the United States. Acosta brought up a poem on the Statue of Liberty and then asked if the White House was trying to change what it means to be an immigrant. Miller at one point asked, "Do you seriously at CNN not know the difference between green card policy and illegal immigration?" At that point, Acosta pointed out that he is the son of a Cuban immigrant. Later, Miller said Acosta was showing his "cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree." When asked to clarify new Trump's take on immigration reform, White House adviser Stephen Miller told CNN's Jim Acosta, a first-generation Cuban American, that his question was "outrageous, insulting, and foolish."

---split---19.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/open-book-president-lays-war-like-posture-plan---split---President Donald Trump walks toward Marine One from the Oval Office on Oct. 12. He sent several clear signals about his re-election messaging the day after the midterm elections cost his part the House. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) ANALYSIS | “I think I am an open book,” President Donald Trump said Wednesday. He made good on that pledge during a roller coaster press conference when he made clear he is spoiling for a “war” with House Democrats and the media. Trump fired a shot across the bow, warning Democrats if they launch investigations into him, he will immediately go into a “war-like posture” that will ensure “nothing is done” in Washington. He sparred with reporters, barking at several to sit down while calling a CNN journalist a disgrace. He talked over reporters trying to ask questions and called an African-American PBS reporter’s question “racist.” Presidents have stood in the same East Room or Rose Garden or White House briefing room over the years after losing seats in Congress or control of one chamber, as Trump did with the House on Tuesday. Most admitted mistakes, said they respected voters’ decisions and called for unity. Not the “open book” president. An ever-defiant Trump claimed victory and even ticked off a list of GOP candidates who lost because they refused “the embrace.” Read: His embrace. Trump simply was not going to pass up a chance to point out their resistance to what he described as his Midas touch on the campaign trail; he noted of the 10 GOP candidates for which he campaigned in the final days, “nine won.” In a remarkable press conference that lasted 87 minutes, Trump sent message after message to House Democrats to tread carefully with their newfound investigative and subpoena powers. [A Defiant Trump Declares Midterm Outcome a Historic Event] “It’s all about deal-making. I believe we have a chance to get along very well with the Democrats,” he said, adding both sides “have a chance to get a tremendous amount of legislation.” But should he be pushed and pushed into his promised “war-like posture,” Trump did not try to hide his possible communications strategy. “If they investigate … nothing is done,” he warned. “And them being in the majority, I’m just going to blame them,” he said, remarkably just moments after extolling his contribution to expanding the GOP majority in the Senate. “They will be blamed,” he said flatly. Watch: Trump Declares Success in the Midterms, Spars With CNN Reporter This came from a commander in chief who refuses to talk about military actions he might take, saying former presidents unwisely telegraphed their plans to U.S. enemies. Yet, he laid out his 2020 political battleplan on international television. As the reality television star-turned-chief executive made threat after threat toward House Democrats and jousted with reporters from CNN, NBC, PBS and American Urban Radio Networks, his 2020 election messaging plan started coming into focus. The president did not formally kick off his re-election bid Wednesday, but he continued efforts to put key pieces in place. For instance, he endorsed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to become speaker in the new Congress. In fact, he offered to press House Republicans to put her over the top in January if she lacks the Democratic votes to take back the gavel. Pelosi is among the least popular Democratic figures with his conservative base. Just like other House Democrats. Just like the mainstream media. Trump knows he will need that base to turn out in big numbers in enough states in two years to continue being president, a job he said Wednesday he enjoys. He said in the states he visited down the stretch, “my message was very well received.” For instance, Trump claimed to have helped Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is leading his race to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson — albeit by a razor-thin margin with 100 percent of precincts reporting. Voters handing the House to Democrats changed nothing about Trump’s approach: It’s still all about his base. Results show college-educated white voters and women who have supported Republicans switched sides Tuesday. But Trump made no effort to reach out to them in his first public appearance since the midterms. “Right now, public opinion is bolting in a liberal direction on … old-time New Deal issues — health care, more government programs, etc.,” said Marc Hetherington, a University of North Carolina political science professor. “This often happens. [Health Care, Anti-Trump Message ‘Won’t Suffice’ for 2020 Dems] “Public opinion usually moves in the direction opposite the new incumbent administration. But it is moving much faster right now,” he said. “It is those meat and potatoes issues that Democrats must focus on. If they do, they have a better chance to win.” Experts expect Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls and congressional candidates will try to do just that. But the president, as he showed Wednesday, will do his best to ensure his second bid for the White House — like the midterms and like his 2016 race — are all about him. “Trump is an extraordinary campaigner,” said Barbara Perry of the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. “Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and FDR were all presidents who were masters of the media of their day. But Trump is the master with his Twitter and the bullying style and just precipitating crises du jour it seems like every day. … He sets the narrative, the agenda every single day.” Trump said Wednesday he would be open to taking a softer tone toward his political foes and the media. “I think there’s going to be much less gridlock because of how this is going,” the president said. “I would like to have an easy tone. … I’d be very good at a low tone.” But, he made clear, he just can’t do it. “Hopefully the tone can get a lot better. I really believe it begins with the media,” he said, lecturing the packed room full of journalists. “I do have a right to fight back because I’m treated unfairly.” He’s made his base feel they are, too — and that he’s fighting their fight against “the elite.” Democrats doubt the brash New Yorker is going to change his style one bit. As a former spokesman to Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said: “Trump has proven he’s going to try new and creative ways to divide the country.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---19.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/business/media/trump-press-conference-media.html---split---Supported by By Michael M. Grynbaum President Trump lashed out at journalists during a surly and contentious news conference at the White House on Wednesday, renewing his attacks on the news media as “the enemy of the people” just moments after pledging an end to partisan politics in the wake of a grueling midterm election. In tense exchanges on live television, Mr. Trump denounced a network correspondent as “very rude,” sternly told several reporters to “sit down,” and at one point stepped away from his lectern, suggesting that he was prepared to cut off the session — a rare formal East Room news conference — because of queries he disliked. Not for the first time, Mr. Trump appeared most incensed by a question from Jim Acosta of CNN, who challenged Mr. Trump’s characterization of a caravan of migrants in Mexico as an imminent “invasion.” “Honestly, I think you should let me run the country — you run CNN,” Mr. Trump replied, his voice rising. “And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.” When Mr. Acosta attempted a follow-up, about the special counsel’s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign, the president’s patience — what little was left — evaporated. “That’s enough, that’s enough,” Mr. Trump said. “Put down the mic.” As cameras rolled, a White House aide leaned toward Mr. Acosta and attempted to remove the microphone from his hands. Mr. Acosta held on (“Pardon me, ma’am”) and declined to sit, as Mr. Trump continued to berate him. “CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them,” the president said. “You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN.” He added, in a reference to the White House press secretary: “The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. You shouldn’t treat people that way.” Jabbing a finger in the reporter’s direction, he said, “When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.” The president frequently clashes with reporters, particularly Mr. Acosta, whose confrontational style has sometimes rankled his pressroom colleagues. But Mr. Trump also enjoys the jousting of a live news conference, and he had submitted to a string of interviews in the run-up to Tuesday’s vote. By Wednesday, though, with his party on its heels after having lost control of the House, Mr. Trump seemed more ornery than outgoing. “Sit down!” he shouted several times as April Ryan, a correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, tried to ask a question about voter suppression. “I didn’t call you. I didn’t call you. I’ll give you voter suppression. Take a look at the CNN polls and how inaccurate they were.” As Ms. Ryan persisted, Mr. Trump kept up his scolding. “Such a hostile media, it’s so sad,” he said, accusing Ms. Ryan of interrupting a male reporter’s question. "You rudely interrupted him. You rudely interrupted him.” Later, when Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked about Mr. Trump and white nationalists, the president called her question “racist.” “What you said is so insulting to me,” he told Ms. Alcindor, who, like Ms. Ryan, is a woman of color. “I followed up the president calling my question ‘racist’ with a policy question about his proposed middle class tax cut because that’s what journalists do,” Ms. Alcindor wrote on Twitter after the exchange. “We press on. We focus on the privilege of asking questions for a living. We do the work.” Attacking the press usually redounds to Mr. Trump’s benefit: Many of his supporters are fired up by denunciations of news organizations as liberal elites. Jon Favreau, the “Pod Save America” host and former aide to President Barack Obama, lamented Wednesday’s exchanges as playing into the president’s hands. “Can we not make today into another Trump v. Media fight?” Mr. Favreau wrote on Twitter. “This is exactly what he wants.” The president’s “enemy of the people” language has been blamed for the rising number of threats against journalists, and press freedom groups say Mr. Trump’s words have emboldened autocrats around the world to crack down on reporters. CNN issued a statement on Wednesday standing by Mr. Acosta and calling Mr. Trump’s attacks on the news media “disturbingly un-American.” “While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it,” the network said. Mr. Trump has expressed little sympathy for those concerns. On Wednesday, he ended his appearance by saying, “It isn’t good what the media is doing.” “I am being treated very unfairly,” he said, “and I’m fighting back not for me, but for the people of this country.” At one point Peter Alexander of NBC News piped up in Mr. Acosta’s defense, telling the president that he was “a hard-working, diligent reporter” who “busts his butt.” Mr. Trump shot Mr. Alexander a look. “I’m not a big fan of yours, either, to be honest,” the president said. Even in a tense room filled with journalists, the line earned some laughs.     Catch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights, delivered Sundays.

---split---19.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-out---split---Attorney General Jeff Sessions is out just one day after the 2018 midterms in which Democrats regained control of the House. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions one day after Democrats regained control of the House and voiced intent to ratchet up pressure on the White House. Trump used a tweet Wednesday afternoon to make the announcement and install Matthew Whitaker, Sessions’ chief of staff, as the acting attorney general. “We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date,” the president wrote after sidestepping a question about Sessions’ future during a wild press conference. Sessions’ ouster came just over an hours after Trump said he liked members of his Cabinet but repeated his line that “everyone leaves” an administration at some point. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York reacted to the news in real-time at a post-midterm press conference. See the Moment Chuck Schumer Learned Jeff Sessions Was Fired “Protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount,” Schumer said after his communications director passed him a note. “It would create a constitutional crisis if this were a prelude to ending or greatly limiting the Mueller investigation.” Schumer declined to answer a question about what he would want to see in an attorney general nominee, while raising suspicions about Trump’s decision to oust Sessions. “I find the timing very suspect, number one,” he said. “But number two our paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one should be able to interfere in the Mueller investigation in any way.” The president’s frustrations with his attorney general have at times publicly boiled into what appeared to be anger over many issues related to the Justice Department’s Russia election meddling probe. Trump wanted Sessions to fire special counsel Robert Mueller and openly panned him for not appointing a second special counsel to investigate 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The president at one point fired off a list of tweets during Sessions’ tenure criticizing the attorney general. “Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers?” he wrote Feb. 28, adding of the former GOP senator’s judgment: “DISGRACEFUL!” Sessions fired back later that day, saying “as long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.” Trump’s own description of his frustrations with Sessions, who was the first Republican senator to endorse Trump’s candidacy, began shortly after Sessions took office. The attorney general recused himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election due to meetings with a Russian diplomat he did not disclose during his Senate confirmation process. The departure will likely be interpreted by Democrats and Trump critics as the president making a move against the Justice Department special counselor for the Russia investigation because Sessions would not fire Mueller, and could allow Trump to appoint an attorney general or acting AG who would fire Mueller. What might happen next could be explosive. Sessions has many Republican friends in the Senate. Despite initially defending Sessions, as the Justice Department’s Russia probe appeared to move deeper inside Trump’s inner circle to his eldest son and son-in-law, the president began to grow disenchanted with his attorney general. Calling the recusal “very unfair to the president,” Trump decided to take his frustrations public during a July 19 interview with the New York Times, a rare move by a sitting president against an attorney general — or any Cabinet member. “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump told the newspaper. “How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?” said Trump. “If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you.’ “It’s extremely unfair — and that’s a mild word — to the president,” Trump said. From there, Trump began steadily hammering Sessions on Twitter. On July 25, the president wrote the attorney general “has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!” Senate Republicans, including the two leaders of the Judiciary Committee, initially warned Trump against pushing Sessions out. But as the duo’s relationship soured, both Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina relented, with the former saying he is confident the panel can find time to move what will be a politically charged nomination. Sessions had a memorable stint as the country’s top law enforcement official since he left what some experts call one of the safest Senate seats. He had represented Alabama in the chamber since 1997. White House officials would privately say they would remind the president that the attorney general was implementing his agenda likely better than any other Cabinet official when Trump would grow angry with him. For instance, Sessions moved to lengthen sentences for drug-related charges and moved to restrict federal funding to so-called immigration “sanctuary cities,” among other decisions that riled Democrats and even troubled some Republicans. He also was the central figure in a memorable June 13 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that was part of the panel’s ongoing Russia meddling probe. Trump’s first attorney general aggressively denied any involvement that day to collude with Russian officials to interfere in the 2016 president election on Trump’s behalf. “The suggestion that I participated in any collusion” that would hurt the United States, which “I have served for 35 years,” an emotional Sessions said, “is an appalling and detestable lie.” Jennifer Shutt and Lindsey McPherson contributed to this report.Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---19.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-japanese-reporter-press-conference_us_5be33c38e4b0e8438892f5f4---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: President Donald Trump is under fire for his reaction to a Japanese reporter’s question. The reporter, who had an accent, began asking Trump a question regarding the economy at a press conference at the White House on Wednesday following the midterm elections. The president interjected, asking, “Where are you from, please?” When the reporter responded with “Japan,” Trump told him to “say hello to Shinzo,” referencing the country’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Trump tells a Japanese reporter "say hello to Shinzo," then continues the snarks with: "I'm sure he's happy about tariffs on his cars." He then tells the reporter, who has an accent, "I can't understand you." I had to close my eyes for 10 seconds with a deep sigh on this one. pic.twitter.com/6rYdcPy0Gh “I’m sure he’s happy about tariffs on his cars,” Trump said. When the reporter attempted to finish his question about trade, the president responded, saying, “I really don’t understand you.” Trump eventually answered, claiming Japan has treated the U.S. “very unfairly” when it comes to the auto trade. The president’s handling of the question prompted criticism from many who viewed Trump’s reactions to the reporter as racist or condescending. He really is tactless. Trump isn't fit to be president, just based on these conferences alone. The way he just handled this Japanese reporter as abhorrent. This is my take as if this were in a vacuum in itself. My god Trump just out there being openly racist to a Japanese reporter. What’s more, Trump claimed to have not understood two other reporters of color at the same press conference. A female reporter with an accent had asked the president for his take of the Muslim women who had won seats in Congress, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of the Minnesota. “I don’t understand what you’re saying,” Trump responded. Another reporter added, “I’m from Brooklyn, so you can understand me.” And when yet another journalist with an accent, from Lebanon, asked Trump a question about Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Trump responded, “Who? I don’t understand him.” For the third time during this press conference, President Trump said he couldn't understand a journalist speaking English with a foreign accent. This time it was a reporter from Lebanon. Many felt it was no coincidence Trump responded similarly to foreign reporters. Is it my imagination or has Trump mocked the accent of every foreign reporter called upon at this brouhaha? He can't help himself. #WhereYouFrom #JamesArness pic.twitter.com/nOHPMSOmnv Seriously. Our President interrupts and dismisses every reporter that has an accent that isn't American. I wish we had a President we could respect at least a little bit. #trump #pressconference Trump is being so racist with every reporter who has an accent that asks him questions. "I don't understand you." He also just called a black woman racist towards him. This White House #PressConference is bazaar. As HuffPost reporter Marina Fang pointed out, Trump’s treatment of those with accents is painful. People with accents are often treated as though they are less intelligent than those with accentless English. This pisses me off to no end, in particular bc my whole life, I've watched people demean, belittle, and dismiss my mother for speaking accented English. So many immigrants and children of immigrants have had this experience, and it sticks with you forever. One egregious example is Fox News darling Jesse Watters’ 2016 “Chinatown” segment, which made Asian accents and those who didn’t understand English the butt of the joke. But, as Ronny Chieng of “The Daily Show,” who produced a segment in response to Watters’ bit, told HuffPost in August, “You don’t have to speak English to have sophisticated political opinions.”
---split---20.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/replacements-trump-no-shortage-candidates-follow-sessions---split---Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., endorses Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee for president during a campaign rally at Madison City Schools Stadium in Madison, Ala., on Feb. 28. 2016. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) There is no shortage of candidates to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general, and President Donald Trump could even again turn to the Senate. Sessions and Trump clashed almost from the start, with the president even admitting he gave the former Alabama lawmaker the job out of a sense of loyalty. Sessions was the first GOP senator to endorse Trump’s 2016 White House candidacy. As Democrats warn of a constitutional crisis, the president will get to pick a nominee this time for other reasons. The president has made clear he wants the attorney general to protect him, which experts and Democratic lawmakers say is at odds with the role of the country’s top lawyer. But with Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III continuing his Russia election probe, Trump almost certainly will demand his pick be more hands-on with that probe and also view it with the same skepticism he does. Trump is promising to announce a nominee “at a later date.” Here are some possible replacements. The 49-year-old had been Sessions’ chief of staff. He also is a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, and once sought political office as a GOP candidate. Iowa is important to Trump’s 2020 re-election plans. And another politician likely would be attractive, since the president has no qualms about using his Justice Department for his own political purposes. [Health Care, Anti-Trump Message ‘Won’t Suffice’ for 2020 Dems] Whitaker also has been highly critical of the Mueller probe, though that could hinder a potential nomination with a few moderate Republican senators who support allowing the special counsel to finish his work. “It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,” he wrote in a 2017 CNN op-ed. Social media was abuzz Wednesday afternoon that the deputy attorney general would be next as Trump zeroes in on the Mueller probe, which he again Wednesday said should be ended soon because “there was no collusion” between his 2016 campaign and Russians. Trump and Rosenstein have publicly butted heads, and the president has also criticized his handling of the Mueller investigation. But, notably, the two recently mended fences during an Air Force One chat. And days before that, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly appeared to deliver a vote of confidence in Rosenstein when he purposely walked him to his vehicle following a meeting — making sure television cameras got a shot of them together. And Trump has since said the two have a “good relationship.” Also notable: Like Sessions, Rosenstein has been an architect of the Trump Justice Department’s agenda. And he’s already been confirmed by the Senate, where he is respected by members of both parties. The outgoing Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi has long been a Trump ally. She met with the then-president elect at Trump Tower following his 2016 victory and was considered for a Cabinet position two years ago. Her tussles with former President Barack Obama no doubt will appeal to Trump, who is ever-mindful of a need to assuage his conservative base. [Voters Send Mixed Signals About Trump with Split Decision] But the 52-year-old might prefer cashing in after her term expires by heading for a lucrative private-sector position — or positions. That could include some kind of cable news show or job — where she still would have the president’s ear without a public servant’s salary. There’s Sen. Ted Cruz, a former Texas solicitor general. But he just won a hard-fought re-election fight with Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and his nomination would spark a special election. And Trump and Cruz once had a rocky relationship to say the least, but have — publicly, at least — reconciled. There’s also Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who could become Judiciary Committee chairman if Charles E. Grassley of Iowa opts to leave the panel. Graham has said he doesn’t want a Cabinet post — but one wasn’t vacant when he said that. Choosing Grassley would give the veteran senator a Cabinet post that would be a career punctuation mark while giving him a chance to continue what Sessions started. Mike Lee of Utah is another Judiciary Committee member who might get a look. He often is mentioned as a potential Supreme Court nominee under Republican presidents. Tapping a senator might make the confirmation process a mere battle, rather than a partisan war like that of now-Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Kris Kobach If the president wants a fight — and his performance during a Wednesday press conference suggests he isn’t opposed to one — he might select the outgoing Kansas secretary of state. Projected to lose his re-election bid, Kobach has repeatedly been praised by Trump over his hardline immigration policies and was a leader of his short-lived voter fraud commission. But those immigration policies might be too tough to garner confirmation — though it would be a wink toward Trump’s base.

---split---20.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-resigns-trumps-request/story?id=59037350---split---Jeff Sessions has resigned as attorney general effective immediately after being asked to do so by President Trump. "At your request, I am submitting my resignation," Sessions wrote in an undated letter to the president. "Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country," Sessions wrote. "I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice."   On Twitter, Trump thanked Sessions for his service and announced that Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, will serve as acting attorney general and that a permanent replacement will take place at a later date.  ....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.  Whitaker in a statement called Sessions as a dedicated public servant and said he is committed to leading the Justice Department with the "highest ethical standards." "It is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans. I will work with our colleagues in Federal, State, local, and tribal leadership, including our partners in law enforcement and our U.S. Attorneys, to ensure the safety of all Americans and the security of the nation," the statement read. "Attorney General Sessions has been a dedicated public servant for over 40 years. It has been a privilege to work under his leadership. He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well."   Sessions left the Justice Department Wednesday afternoon after meeting with staff. About 150 people, including many longtime career attorneys, clapped as he walked out, gave him a thumbs up, and shook hands. During a lengthy press conference Wednesday morning, Trump declined to say what staff changes he had planned, but said it was "no great secret" that "a lot of administrations make changes after midterms." Trump was specifically asked by a reporter about chief of staff John Kelly. "I will say that for the most part, I'm very, very happy with this cabinet," Trump said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wished Sessions well after learning of his resignation Wednesday afternoon. "I thank Jeff Sessions for his dedicated service as Attorney General. Throughout his career, as a prosecutor, a Senator and as Attorney General, he remained steadfast in his commitment to the rule of law and his love of our great nation. I wish him well and look forward to working with him in any future endeavors," McConnell said. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the move as an attempt to quash the Russia probe. "It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions’ firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation," Pelosi tweeted. "Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller’s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts."  Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller’s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts  But Democratic Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called for an investigation into the timing of Sessions' resignation. "There are many, many reasons to remove Attorney General Sessions -- from his failure to disclose his communications with the Russians to his inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the border -- but one reason that is not acceptable is to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller investigation," Cummings said. "President Trump waited until just hours after the midterm elections to make this move, which had been rumored for months. Congress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel’s probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation," Cummings added.   Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, also called for accountability. "Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation? We will be holding people accountable," Nadler tweeted.  Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation? We will be holding people accountable. https://t.co/weykMuiCxm  A DOJ spokeswoman said that Whitaker does not need to be sworn in and is therefore already the acting attorney general. Tensions developed between Trump and Sessions in March 2017, when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took over. Rosenstein soon appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the Russia probe, angering the president.   Federal law makes clear that a special counsel is overseen by the attorney general, so Whitaker will now oversee the probe. Whitaker has publicly criticized the probe in the past, including in an August 2017 op-ed for CNN. "I've prosecuted several financial crimes at the federal level and I've also defended plenty in my private practice. From this unique vantage point, I can understand how a motivated prosecutor, in a broad investigation into the financial affairs of high-profile individuals, can become overzealous toward the targets of such probes -- with calamitous results," Whitaker wrote at the time. "While no one is above the law, in situations such as this, any seasoned prosecutor must use discretion both judiciously and expertly." "It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel," Whitaker added.   Following Sessions' resignation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the probe. "Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general," Schumer said in a statement. Schumer later tweeted that: "Clearly, the President has something to hide."  Clearly, the President has something to hide. https://t.co/m1sQV9oBwl   Previously, Trump would not say whether Sessions -- who he has repeatedly criticized throughout his tenure -- would be safe in his job after the midterm elections. "I just would love to have him do a great job," Trump told Bloomberg News on Aug. 30.     "I’d love to have him look at the other side," Trump added, underscoring his demand for Sessions to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton and the origins of the Russia investigation. Earlier in August, in an interview with Fox News, Trump lashed out at Sessions, saying he failed to take control of the Department of Justice.   In his most forceful public rebuke to date, Sessions hit back shortly after, saying he "will not be improperly influenced by political considerations." Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump confidante, predicted Sessions would be out of his job in the near future, but insisted Trump should wait until after November's midterm elections.   "The president’s entitled to an attorney general he has faith in, somebody that’s qualified for the job, and I think there will come a time, sooner rather than later, where it will be time to have a new face and a fresh voice at the Department of Justice," Graham said at the time. "Clearly, Attorney General Sessions doesn’t have the confidence of the president." Trump repeatedly called on Sessions to end the Russia probe on Twitter and TV interviews. "..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!" Trump tweeted on Aug. 1.  ..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!  Sessions was the first sitting U.S. senator to endorse then-candidate Trump.   Sessions parlayed that support to become attorney general, a role he held at the state level in Alabama. The president's priorities and Sessions' mirrored each other. Both tough on immigration, the opioid crisis, and crime, both men have a pro-law enforcement perspective. Aside from the president lashing out at him, Sessions' tenure as attorney general has largely been focused on carrying out the policies of the administration and most notably, the zero-tolerance immigration policy which lead to the separation of families on the U.S.-Mexico border.     When Sessions announced the policy in May, he warned those coming to the country illegally that the administration would prosecute them. "I have put in place a 'zero tolerance' policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border. If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law," he said at an event in San Diego. The policy was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike. Sessions also sent more judges and prosecutors to the southern border to help with processing illegal border crossers.   In his resignation letter, Sessions described restoring and upholding the "rule of law" as his most important legacy as attorney general. "We have operated with integrity and have lawfully and aggressively advanced the policy agenda of this administration," Sessions wrote. He called his work implementing the "law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law" a "central part" of Trump's campaign for presidency. Sessions also thanked the "fabulous men and women in law enforcement," calling it his greatest honor to serve alongside them.  Sessions Resignation Letter by ABC News Politics on Scribd The attorney general also focused on pro-law enforcement priorities and often echoed the president in touting law enforcement's objectives. "Let me say this loud and clear: as long as I am the Attorney General of the United States, the Department of Justice will have the back of all honest and honorable law enforcement officers," Sessions said at the 25th Annual Top Cops Awards in May. Sessions was also a regular steward for rigorous opioid prosecution. Just recently, in Cleveland, Sessions announced four opioid cases, each targeting the selling and distribution of opioids, something that he stressed was important to the president. ABC News' Luke Barr, Julia Jacobo and Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.
---split---21.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/trump-midterms-house-senate.html---split---Supported by By Peter Baker and Michael D. Shear WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to adopt a “warlike posture” against Democrats if they use their newly won control of the House to investigate his financial and political dealings, drawing a line at the start of a new era of divided government. The president began a postelection news conference with an offer to work across party lines, but his conciliatory tone quickly turned contentious. And barely an hour later, he announced the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in defiance of Democrats who saw an effort to impede the Russia investigation. House Democrats also made the traditional nod to bipartisanship after their victory in Tuesday’s midterm elections even as they emphasized that they would scrutinize everything from Mr. Trump’s taxes to his campaign’s ties to Russia in 2016. But after Mr. Sessions was fired, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said the decision would be investigated once Democrats took over in January. [Read the latest on Jeff Sessions’s resignation.] The instant exchange of fire indicated that there may be no lull in the conflict that has cleaved Washington during the Trump era, and if anything, it may escalate beyond what the last two years have brought. Once in control of all the levers of power in the capital, the president and his party now face the prospect of an opposition House armed with subpoena power and stocked by Democrats who won office on the promise of imposing a check on him. Any talk of lowering the temperature after a harsh campaign seemed to dissipate as the president angrily scolded reporters whose questions or behavior he did not like. By the end of the day, the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta of CNN, a move that other presidents did not take even during times of great tension with the news media. Democrats picked up at least 27 seats in the House on Tuesday, with 17 still undecided, and claimed seven additional governorships in places like Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, states that Mr. Trump won two years ago and will be crucial to his chances of re-election in 2020. But he claimed a “great victory” because Republicans held on to the Senate and even knocked off Democratic incumbents in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, while losing only one of their own seats in Nevada. If they hold on to their current leads, Republicans will increase their majority to 54 seats from 51, giving them more maneuvering room as they confirm judges and other appointments by Mr. Trump. Although the balance of power in Congress was no longer in doubt, some key contests remained in flux. In Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat, trailing by more than 30,000 votes, called for a recount, an idea dismissed as “sad” by his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, trailed Martha McSally, the Republican, by more than 15,000 votes in a race. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who is trying to become the nation’s first black female governor, had not conceded her race against Brian Kemp, the Republican, in a race shadowed by concerns over voter suppression. Democrats did find good news in Montana, where Senator Jon Tester narrowly won re-election against Matt Rosendale, the Republican challenger backed by Mr. Trump in repeated rallies late in the campaign. At his news conference, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying to adjust to the new reality in Washington. “I would like to see bipartisanship. I’d like to see unity,” he said. But he said he would not tolerate investigations and would use allies in the Senate to open inquiries against Democrats in response: “If that happens, then we’re going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt. And I would blame them.” Mr. Trump was the fourth president in a row to endure a major midterm election defeat. Mr. Trump’s tone, however, was strikingly different from that of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who all expressed degrees of humility after major midterm losses in 1994, 2006 and 2010. Mr. Bush called his setback a “thumping,” and Mr. Obama described his as a “shellacking,” but Mr. Trump maintained that he had nothing to regret. He lost fewer seats in the House than Mr. Obama did and unlike his predecessor picked up Senate seats, he noted. The lesson he said he took from the election was validation. “I think people like me,” the president said. “I think people like the job I’m doing, frankly.” The candidates he helped ended up winning, he said, and those who lost went down because they distanced themselves from him. “Mia Love gave me no love,” Mr. Trump said of a Republican congresswoman from Utah. “And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.” He singled out other Republicans who lost because, he said, they did not embrace him. “Didn’t want the embrace,” he said repeatedly. One Republican Mr. Trump did embrace on Wednesday was Vice President Mike Pence. Asked if he would commit to keeping Mr. Pence on the ticket in 2020, the president said, “Well, I haven’t asked him, but I hope so.” Then, spotting Mr. Pence in the audience, he said, “Mike, will you be my running mate?” Mr. Pence stood up and nodded that he would. Turning back to the reporter, Mr. Trump said, “The answer is yes, O.K.? The turnover in the House foreshadowed a sharp change in Mr. Trump’s presidency. A Democratic House not only can block Mr. Trump’s priorities like building a wall along the southern border and repealing Mr. Obama’s health care program, but it also can use subpoena power to investigate all manner of issues that he had been protected from until now. Among other things, Democrats are likely to demand the release of tax returns that he has kept secret, look into his business dealings and reopen the House investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump’s team and Russia during the 2016 election. “The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt,” Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on NBC News. “And we will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning and his financial entanglements overseas.” After Mr. Sessions was fired later in the day, Representatives Jerry Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, the incoming chairmen of the judiciary and intelligence committees, vowed to take action. “The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable,” Mr. Nadler said. “If the president seeks to interfere in the impartial administration of justice, the Congress must stop him,” Mr. Schiff said. “No one is above the law.” Mr. Trump opened his news conference with an embrace of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and endorsed her bid to regain the speakership that she lost eight years ago. He even suggested that it may be better for him that Democrats won the House because he can make deals with them, while legislating with a narrower Republican majority might have been more difficult. “There are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble, that we agree very much with them and they agree with us,” Mr. Trump said, citing health care, pharmaceutical drug prices, the environment and infrastructure. “I would like to see bipartisanship. I’d like to see unity. Maybe not on everything, but I think we have a very good chance of seeing that.” Yet talk of compromise quickly turned to confrontation as he said he would fight fire with fire if Democrats follow through on their vows to use the subpoena power. “They can play that game, but we can play better because we have a thing called the United States Senate and a lot of very questionable things were done, between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place,” he said. For her part, Ms. Pelosi said she hoped that this would be a “new era” and noted that she worked productively with Mr. Bush when Democrats held the House during his last two years in office. “The fact is we’d like to work together so legislation would be bipartisan,” she said. But Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would not curb their aspirations in the interest of compromise. “We’re not going for the lowest common denominator,” she said. “We’re going for the boldest common denominator.” While he has presented himself as a natural negotiator from his time in real estate, Mr. Trump has made almost no deals with opposition Democrats since taking office. Mr. Trump had one brief moment of comity with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, when they agreed to a short-term spending deal, but it quickly evaporated amid disagreement over immigration. The news conference, only his third formal solo session with reporters at the White House since he took office 22 months ago, showcased his toxic relationship with the news media. He complained repeatedly that he had been treated unfairly and engaged in several heated exchanges with reporters who questioned him. “You’re a very rude person,” he told Mr. Acosta, the CNN reporter, who persisted in pressing him after the president was ready to move on and sought to keep a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him. When an NBC reporter stuck up for Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump retorted, “Well, I’m not a big fan of yours either.” He snapped at a third reporter who tried to ask a question. “Sit down,” he said. “I didn’t call you.” When a fourth reporter, who is black, asked if he had emboldened white supremacists by adopting the label “nationalist” during the campaign, he lashed out. “That’s such a racist question,” he said, jabbing a finger at her. By the evening, the White House suspended Mr. Acosta’s White House hard pass issued by the Secret Service granting journalists access to the building, falsely accusing him of “placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.” Reporters sitting nearby said that was an untrue characterization of what had happened.

---split---21.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/defiant-trump-historic-event---split---President Donald Trump has declared the midterm election results a historic event, claiming his efforts helped Republicans defy history. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) A defiant President Donald Trump on Wednesday painted Tuesday’s midterm elections as a historic event, declaring his efforts helped Republicans defy history and overcome a major Democratic fundraising advantage and negative media coverage. He appeared in the East Room of the White House just hours after Republicans lost control of the House but expanded their narrow Senate majority. Trump focused mostly for Senate Republican candidates in the races final weeks, opening the door for him to declare victory — though his critics do not see it that way. House Democrats soon will be armed with investigative and subpoena power with several likely committee chairs eying probes of many facets of the Trump presidency and some in the caucus want to begin impeachment proceedings even as their leaders urge caution. “Americans have spoken and they have empowered a Democratic House Majority to fight for the people. It is now up to us to get to work and take action that raises wages, lowers health care costs, and cleans up corruption,” House Appropriations ranking member Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said in a statement. Watch: Trump Declares Success in the Midterms, Spars With CNN Reporter Trump opened the press conference by noting first-term presidents typically lose seats during their first midterms, saying Republicans “exceeding expectations” on Tuesday. He said he campaigned for 10 candidates in the race’s final days, “and nine won.” “We were getting bombarded by money on the other side,” he said, lamenting Democratic “special interests.” He did not mention that conservative groups that would fit the same definition regularly give money to GOP candidates. Trump noted a too-close-to-call Arizona Senate race between GOP Rep. Martha McSally, and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema “looks really good.” If McSally wins, it would keep the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jeff Flake in the Republican column. The president predicted Republicans and Democrats should be able to compromise on legislation, but he did not elaborate during his opening remarks. “The Democrats will come to us with a plan for health care [and] a plan for infrastructure,” he said, striking an optimistic tone by adding “and then we’ll compromise.” Trump also took on the specter of his administration facing unprecedented oversight from House committees headed by Democrats who will set the agenda. “They can play that game," he said of House Democrats’ expected investigations, “but we can play that game better.” He warned against “investigation fatigue,” echoing experts that such a climate likely would stifle any efforts to craft passable and signable bills. Trump signaled Republicans will use the Senate as a check against left-leaning policy and spending bills. "We have a lot in common on infrastructure," he said, stopping short of saying he expects to sign a bill to upgrade roads, bridges, airports, tunnels and seaports. His plan last year never gained traction. As he can be when reading prepared remarks, Trump sounded like other presidents who lost a chamber in midterm elections. "Now is the time for both parties to join together," he said, calling on both parties to join forces to maintain the "economic miracle" and "protect the military." “Government comes to a halt” if Democrats hit him with a slew of subpoenas, Trump said when asked about the 2019 agenda. He again said the two sides “agree very much” on infrastructure and other issues. After threatening in the past to shutter the federal government unless Democrats give him more funding for his southern border wall, Trump said Wednesday of taking that action now that he has to negotiate with House Democrats: “Not necessarily.” “We're going to be fighting for it,” he said of wall monies. “Their whole agenda has been not giving me anything for the wall.” After a tense and angry back-and-forth, Trump told CNN’s Jim Acosta he is a “terrible” person and said the network should be “ashamed” of itself for employing him. The two continued to bicker even after Trump moved to a NBC reporter in a remarkable scene that pushed well beyond traditional exchanges between a president and the media — even contentious ones. Trump later barked “Sit down!” at reporter April Ryan when she tried to ask a question without being called on, describing her as “rudely interrupting” another reporter. Trump denied he is putting Americans against one another and adding to the country’s tribal politics, noting “we won a lot of elections last night.” In a lighter moment, when asked if Vice President Mike Pence would be his 2020 running mate, Trump asked his No. 2 on the spot. Seated in the front row, Pence nodded his agreement. “That was unexpected,” Trump said to laughter. “But I feel fine.” Trump said trading middle-class tax rate reductions for raising rates on corporations and the most wealthy Americans “could be” on the table as he must negotiate next year with a Democratic-run House Ways and Means Committee. He said he still wants to pass such a bill despite losing the House. Should Rep. Nancy Pelosi be short of the required votes to become speaker in January, Trump said he believes he has enough allies in the House Republican conference to give her the gavel. He said his morning tweet saying she deserves the job was not sarcastic. Asked about critics who said his declaration on the campaign trail that he is a “nationalist” was a code word for white supremacy, Trump denied it and told an African-American reporter it was “a racist question.” ‘I Love That We Have The Right’— Voters Around the Beltway Share Their Election Day Thoughts Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

"We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!" Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. The president had repeatedly criticised his top law enforcement official after he recused himself from the Russia investigation dogging the White House. Mr Trump said Mr Sessions will be temporarily replaced by his chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who has criticised the Russia inquiry. In a resignation letter, Mr Sessions - a former Alabama senator who was an early supporter of Mr Trump - made clear the decision to go was not his own. "Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation," he wrote in an undated letter. "Most importantly, in my time as attorney general, we have restored and upheld the rule of law," Mr Sessions added, while thanking the Republican president. According to a White House official, Mr Trump's Chief of Staff John Kelly called Mr Sessions on Wednesday before Mr Trump held a press conference to discuss mid-term election results. Mr Trump has repeatedly pilloried his top law enforcement official since Mr Sessions stepped aside from the Russia inquiry in March 2017. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is hunting for evidence of potential collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Moscow. The wide-ranging investigation - overseen by the Department of Justice - has resulted in a series of criminal charges against several Trump associates. In July 2017 Mr Trump told the New York Times: "Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else." Mr Sessions voluntarily removed himself from the probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing. The attorney general later said he had forgotten about those meetings, which happened during the Trump election campaign. Mr Trump has at various times belittled Mr Sessions as "VERY weak" and "DISGRACEFUL". CBS News is reporting that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is no longer leading the Mueller inquiry, and that Matthew Whitaker will now assume control. The president cannot directly fire the special counsel, whose investigation Mr Trump has repeatedly decried as a witch hunt. But Mr Sessions' replacement will have the power to fire Mr Mueller or end the inquiry. Mr Rosenstein was summoned to the White House on Wednesday for what was described as a previously scheduled meeting. It was the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr Mueller to lead the Russia inquiry, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017. The special counsel's probe has also been investigating whether Mr Comey's firing amounted to attempted obstruction of justice. There has also been a question mark over Mr Rosenstein's future since it was reported he had discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Trump. This summer he was abruptly summoned to the White House amid fevered speculation he was about to be fired, however, no announcement came. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The presidential axe that had been hovering over Jeff Sessions for what has seemed like an eternity just came swinging down with a thud. Donald Trump had previously said he would wait until after the mid-term elections to decide his attorney general's fate, and he did - but just barely. And like that the duties of overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation shift from the man who appointed the special counsel, Rod Rosenstein, to a man who has been a critic of it, Department of Justice Chief of Staff Matthew Whitaker. In an opinion piece for The Hill before he took the Department of Justice job, Mr Whitaker wrote that calls for an as yet-to-be-named independent prosecutor would be "just craven attempts to score cheap political points". In April 2017, he wrote for CNN that any Mueller investigation into the president's finances would be "going too far". What happens next is critical. Mr Mueller's inquiry could continue unabated - although the special counsel must surely be considering tightening his timeline. There is also the possibility, however, that this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut down the probe or keep its findings out of the public eye. Democrats were outraged by the attorney general's removal, with the Democratic National Committee noting that the appointee has not been confirmed for the role by the US Senate as required. The party's Senate leader Chuck Schumer tweeted: "Clearly, the President has something to hide." "Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general." Conservative author Ann Coulter praised the "Christ-like Jeff Sessions" for being "the only member of the Trump administration doing anything about immigration". She called on Mr Trump to appoint Mr Sessions to head the Department of Homeland Security. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he looks forward to "working with President Trump to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice". Mr Graham, of South Carolina, had said last year there would be "holy hell to pay" if Mr Sessions was ever fired. The senator was previously tipped as a replacement for Mr Sessions, but he seemed to take himself out of consideration on Wednesday, suggesting he would stay in the Senate. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said: "It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions' firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by President Trump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller's investigation." Mr Trump had publicly humiliated the top law official over the Russia probe dogging his presidency. 15 sayings from around the world

---split---23.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/trump-unloads-cnn-journalist-jim-acosta-you-are-rude-terrible-n933571---split---President Donald Trump's ongoing feud with Jim Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, boiled over on Wednesday, with Trump verbally berating the journalist before the White House ultimately suspended his press access. Acosta tweeted Wednesday night that he was denied access when he tried to enter the White House. He added in another tweet that he didn't "blame" the U.S. Secret Service agent who stopped him. "I know he's just doing his job," Acosta wrote. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later issued a statement that said the reporter's "hard pass" was suspended as a result of his attempt to keep control of a microphone during Wednesday's news conference with the president. She said Acosta put "his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern" during the session, a claim that doesn't appear to be supported by video of the incident. The press secretary called Acosta's behavior "absolutely unacceptable." "It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter’s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question," Sanders stated. I’ve just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit In a statement posted on Twitter, CNN challenged Sanders' account and argued that the suspension of Acosta's credentials "was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference." "Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lied," the cable news network said of the explanation. "This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support." The White House Correspondents’ Association said in a statement late Wednesday that it "strongly objects to the Trump Administration’s decision to use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship." The group added, "We urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action." Earlier in the day Trump called Acosta "a rude, terrible person" as he tried to ask the president a question. The exchange came during a White House press conference on the 2018 midterm elections, in which Trump called out failed Republican candidates who didn't "embrace" him. Trump began taking questions and called on Acosta, who tried to ask about the president's characterization of a migrant caravan of roughly 4,000 Central American immigrants who are walking through Mexico to claim asylum in the U.S. Trump immediately interrupted Acosta as the journalist began to ask his question. "Here we go," Trump said to Acosta. Acosta then challenged Trump's use of the word "invasion" to describe the caravan and asked the president if he thought he had demonized immigrants. Trump then said he wanted immigrants to "come in legally." When the president tried to go to another journalist, Acosta declined to give up the microphone and asked about possible indictments by special counsel Robert Mueller based on the ongoing investigation into Trump's presidential campaign. Trump told Acosta to "put down the mic" and a White House staffer tried to take the microphone from the CNN correspondent but he wouldn't give it up. Acosta finally relinquished the mic and sat down, but Trump then began to verbally berate him from the lectern. "CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them," Trump said. "You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN." Trump added that the way Acosta had treated Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was "awful." The president then moved to address the next questioner, NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander, who defended Acosta. "In Jim's defense, I've traveled with him and watched him, he's a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us," Alexander said. "Well I'm not a big fan of yours either," Trump said. Acosta then stood up and began speaking to the president off microphone, to which the president responded, "When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people." Acosta later tweeted his thanks to Alexander. Many thanks to my friend @PeterAlexander https://t.co/jCl1g8CHQL Later in the news conference, Yamiche Alcindor, White House correspondent for PBS, asked the president about labeling himself a nationalist and whether he felt that emboldened white nationalists. "I don't know why you'd say that," Trump said. "That's such a racist question." Judy Woodruff, anchor and managing editors of PBS NewsHour, tweeted her support for Alcindor. "My @NewsHour colleague @Yamiche is a complete professional, an utterly fair and hardworking reporter, Woodruff wrote. "She did not ask a 'racist question.'" Alcindor later tweeted, "I'm simply asking the question the public wants to know." I'm simply asking the questions the public wants to know. https://t.co/bZ1cZVBKhd "I followed up the president calling my question 'racist' with a policy question about his proposed middle-class tax cut because that's what journalists do," Alcindor, who is black, said in another tweet. "We press on. We focus on the privilege of asking questions for a living. We do the work." Trump also repeatedly told April Ryan, White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, to sit down, adding that "it's such a hostile media." The news conference lasted almost an hour and a half, making it one of the longest of Trump's presidency. CNN released a statement through its public relations Twitter account addressing the exchange with Acosta. "This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far," the company said. "They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American. While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere." Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, criticized Acosta for his part in the exchange. "We all value a free press, but it’s unfortunate that some reporters seem more interested in getting their own cable show than doing their jobs," McDaniel said in a statement. "The media grandstanding has gone overboard." Trump and Acosta have sparred before, with the CNN journalist having emerged as one of the president's favorite personal targets for his broader criticism of the media. In July, Trump declined to take a question from Acosta during a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. "CNN is fake news," Trump said. "I don't take questions from CNN."

---split---23.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-midterms-big-win-tweets-goodbye-republicans/story?id=59028453---split---President Donald Trump, in a remarkable and contentious post-midterm press conference Wednesday from the East Room, hailed bipartisanship and insisted he "stopped the blue wave," referring to the expectation of big Democratic wins. But soon after, the press conference took a turn, and while standing at the podium the president quarreled with Democrats, the press, and even members of his own party. The president fired off what rang out like warning shots for Republicans who hesitated to embrace Trumpism and House Democrats who have threatened a flurry of investigations. The president also tangled with reporters in pugnacious exchanges about his rhetoric on the campaign trail and messaging towards the migrant caravan which some critics say was racist. Still buoyed by what he viewed as successful midterm results, Trump scoffed at the potential for a legally messy year with Democrats controlling the House.   "No, if they do that then all it is is a war-like posture," Trump said. “I hear about investigations – fatigue. They’ve been giving us this investigation fatigue. It’s been a long time. They’ve got nothing,” Trump said. “They can play that game but we can play it better. It’s called the U.S. Senate,” the president said.     But when asked to say point blank whether or not he would turn over his taxes, the president said he would consider if he still weren’t under audit. “If I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it,” Trump said in response to a question for ABC News’ Jonathan Karl. Trump said he will wait until after the audit is completed. The president expressed frustration with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and said he could end the probe "right now." "I could fire everybody right now. But I don't want to stop it. Because politically, I don't like stopping it,” Trump said. “I let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money.” Trump, who has frequently said he is disappointed in Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said he would answer a question about firing Sessions and potential Cabinet changes at a “different time.” “We are a hot country. This is a hot White House,” Trump said. “We are a White House that people want to work with.” At one point, the president called CNN's Jim Acosta, who asked about the inflammatory campaign ad about undocumented migrants that was pulled by major television networks, a "rude, terrible person." "I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN,” the president retorted. Visibly angered by being repeatedly asked about the caravan -- he told Acosta to “put down the mic.” PBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindo, who is African American, asked the president if his embrace of the term "nationalist" embolded white nationalism. "That's such a racist question. Honestly, I know you have it written down, that's a racist question," Trump said. "I love our country. I do. You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems excuse me but to say that what you said is so insulting to me. It's a very terrible thing that you said." That fiery tone was questioned by reporters in the room who cited the divided nation. The president said he would like to have a better tone, but pointed his finger at the media. “I'd be very good at a low tone, but when things are done not correctly about you,” Trump said, "you have to defend yourself. It’s much easier than what I have to do. Going around is much easier than facing someone when you’re being treated unfairly. You know what, when you have to fight – all the time fight – you really can’t do lower.” The president has credited his constant campaigning and endorsements to the success of election night Republican wins. In the final days of the midterm election, Trump crisscrossed the country stumping for the GOP. He said one of the reasons Republican seats flipped to Democrats was that he could not campaign everywhere. “President Obama campaigned very hard in Georgia. Oprah Winfrey campaigned very, very hard all over the television. I said that this is going to be tough. I only had me. I did not have anybody else,” Trump said. However, Vice President Pence, his son Donald Trump Jr., and Republican surrogates, including Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, campaigned. In a shocking political moment standing at the podium from the East Room, the president mocked Republicans who did not embrace him and lost. “They did very badly,” Trump said. “I’m not sure if I should be happy or sad.” He then called out losing Republican members by name for rejecting his support. “Mia Love gave me no love and she lost. Sorry Mia,” Trump said. He also called out Republicans in swing districts like Barbara Comstock in Virginia and Peter Roskam in Illinois. Despite losing the House, the president said he thought the election proved he was popular. “I think people like me, I think people like the job I'm doing," Trump said. “It was a big day yesterday, an incredible day and last night the Republican party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the” midterm year, Trump said. “I thought it was very close to complete victory.” Trump earlier took to Twitter to congratulate Republican winners, to bid adieu to Republican losers who didn't embrace him and to say that now he has a clear path toward "foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals." "Those that worked with me ... did very well," the president tweeted. "Those that did not, say goodbye!" As was widely expected, Democrats took back the House and Republicans maintained their Senate dominance. Americans elected the first Muslim and Native American women among a record 110 women projected to join Congress.    Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!   Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!   Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!  When the new Congress begins in early January, it will look quite a bit different to the president. "President Trump has been eroding the foundations of our democracy," Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., the ranking mMember of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in a statement released Wednesday. "He has been degrading the vision of our Founding Fathers -- from attacking the right to vote to undermining the freedom of the press. "Yesterday, the American people voted to change that. They voted for transparency and accountability. They voted to make sure our government works effectively and efficiently for the American people. And they voted to bring integrity back to government. As part of that mandate, I plan to shine a light on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Trump Administration. I want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money, as well as President Trump's decisions to act in his own financial self-interest rather than the best interests of the American people."

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. A look at the resignation from Attorney General of Jeff Sessions from the Trump Administration and the Attorney General's growing tension with President Trump, including his recusal from the Russia investigation. Jeff Sessions, once one of President Trump’s most loyal and trusted advisers before infuriating Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation, has resigned as attorney general at the request of the president. “At your request, I am submitting my resignation,” Sessions wrote in a Wednesday letter to Trump. The president tweeted that Matthew Whitaker, chief of staff to Sessions, will become the acting attorney general. Whitaker, according to sources, is now overseeing everything at the Justice Department, including the Russia investigation -- despite calls from Democrats to recuse himself. “We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well,” he said. Trump added: “We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.” Sources told Fox News that Trump did not call Sessions, but rather White House Chief of Staff John Kelly informed him of the president’s request that he resign. Sessions is expected to leave the Justice Department by the end of the day, and Whitaker is expected to take over immediately. In his resignation letter, Sessions said he was “honored to serve” as attorney general and said his Justice Department “restored and upheld the rule of law – a glorious tradition that each of us has a responsibility to safeguard.” Sessions' departure from the Justice Department was not unexpected, as the president has signaled that there would be changes to his administration after the midterms. But no one faced more rumors of an imminent dismissal than Sessions. For more than a year, Trump has repeatedly lambasted Sessions over his recusal, saying he wouldn’t have installed him as the country’s top law enforcement officer had he known his attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia probe. In September, Trump said of his strained relationship with Sessions, “I don’t have an attorney general. It’s very sad.” In March 2017, shortly after taking office, Sessions removed himself from the Russia investigation, citing his involvement as a high-profile surrogate and adviser to Trump’s campaign. Jeff Sessions resigns at attorney general by Fox News on Scribd The investigation into the Russian government’s attempted meddling in the election has dogged the president since he took office. Trump and his aides have denied any collusion with the Russians. Sources told Fox News Whitaker will now be overseeing the Russia investigation. However, Justice Department ethics officials have not yet determined whether he will be able to hold that responsibility, or whether he may also have to recuse himself from the investigation. It’s unclear if Special Counsel Robert Mueller was informed before the Sessions announcement. Democrats expressed alarm after the announcement. Upon hearing the news of Sessions’ resignation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that “protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount.” He also called on Whitaker to remove himself from the Russia probe. “Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,” Schumer said in a statement. The Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Committee called for “answers immediately as to the reasoning” behind Sessions’ removal. His statement comes a day after Democrats retook the House, giving them the power to launch investigations. “Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation?” New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler tweeted. “We will be holding people accountable.” Before he took a job at the Justice Department, Whitaker wrote an op-ed saying Mueller “is dangerously close to crossing” a “red line” in the Russia probe if he looked at Trump or his family’s finances. “It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,” Whitaker wrote. “That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.” In March 2017, Sessions announced his plans to recuse himself after reports surfaced detailing undisclosed conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions has said he was acting in his capacity as a Republican senator from Alabama. At the time of his recusal, Sessions said he met with the “relevant senior career department officials” to discuss the issue. “Having concluded those meetings today, I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States,” Sessions said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then took control of the investigation and decided to appoint Mueller to take over the probe. Sessions’ former Senate colleagues on Wednesday praised him for his service. “I thank Jeff Sessions for his dedicated service as attorney general," Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. "Throughout his career, as a prosecutor, a senator and as attorney general, he remained steadfast in his commitment to the rule of law and his love of our great nation. I wish him well and look forward to working with him in any future endeavors.” Sessions also had his critics -- especially from civil libertarians and others who disagreed with his hardline stance against illegal immigration. “Jeff Sessions was the worst attorney general in modern American history,” American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony D. Romero said Wednesday. Trump’s falling out with Sessions was remarkable, considering the pivotal and trusted role the Alabama Republican played for Trump during the campaign. Sessions -- who bonded with Trump over their populist views on trade and immigration -- became the first sitting senator to endorse Trump in February 2016 when he announced his support of the New York businessman’s then-underdog campaign. The endorsement was seen as a blow to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump’s conservative rival in the Republican race whose path to victory included a strong performance in Southern states. Trump won Alabama. Sessions went on to become one of Trump’s most outspoken and prominent surrogates during the campaign. A number of Sessions’ top staffers – including Rick Dearborn and Stephen Miller – took senior White House roles. When other Republicans abandoned Trump after the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape just days before the general election, Sessions stood by Trump. After Trump won the White House, Sessions, who faced no opposition in his 2014 re-election to the Senate, gave up a safe seat to become Trump’s attorney general. During his confirmation hearing, Sessions denied accusations from Democrats that he had made racially insensitive statements in the past. Though most Democrats voted against their former colleague, his confirmation was seen as redemption for Sessions, whose nomination for a 1986 federal judgeship was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. As attorney general, Sessions cracked down on illegal immigration, vowing to enforce federal law. Fox News' John Roberts and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

---split---24.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/down-relationship-between-jeff-sessions-donald-trump-n933711---split---President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions were once the closest of political allies. Then-U.S. Sen. Sessions, R-Ala., played a key role in Trump's accession in the GOP three years ago — and was later rewarded with one of the administration's top jobs. But their relationship appeared to go south when Sessions recused himself from the Department of Justice's probe into whether Russia helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election. A look back the good times and bad: There was time when establishment Republicans kept an arm's length from Trump, who was deemed to be a brash outsider with little chance of winning the GOP nomination. That all changed when Sessions became the first major lawmaker to put on a "Make American Great Again" cap in throwing his support behind the real estate developer and first-time political candidate. It wasn't the first time Sessions had appeared with the Queens, New York, native, but it was the first time he gave an official endorsement. Trump thanked him, saying, "I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard." Thank you @SenatorSessions!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016https://t.co/Szs0QF88HR pic.twitter.com/UL6t60TTjP During his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions was asked then-U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., "If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?" Sessions answered: "I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it." It turned out that Sessions actually had spoken twice to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 campaign, it was revealed in March, 2017. But a spokeswoman at the time said the conversations took place in his capacity as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, not a Trump campaign surrogate. Sessions was confirmed by the Senate, 52-47, after contentious debate. And at the time, President Trump seemed very happy with the pick, tweeting out a fairly enthusiastic "Congratulations!" Congratulations to our new Attorney General, @SenatorSessions! pic.twitter.com/e0buP1K83z But the good feelings were not going to last long. Sessions might not have have known this on March 2, 2017 — but that was the day lost his job as the nation's top law enforcement official. "I should not be involved in investigating a campaign I had a role in," he said. "I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States." Trump initially defended Sessions and said he did nothing wrong. Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not.... If the president had tried to keep his anger at Sessions under wraps, it didn't last long. After Mueller's appointment as special counsel, Trump reportedly berated Sessions during a private, Oval Office tongue lashing. Trump accused Sessions of "disloyalty" and called him an "idiot," The New York Times later reported on Sept. 14, 2017. As the Meuller probe wore on, Trump vented his frustration at Sessions, in a three-day-long Twitter attack. The president asked: "So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? " Later, Trump wrote: "Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! Trump then summed up his frustration with: "Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation ...but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!" Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got.... The New York Times reports that Trump had openly complained about Sessions, saying he wasn't acting enough like Roy Cohn — the president's former personal lawyer and infamous counsel to red-baiting U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Trump once asked White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to lobby Sessions against recusing himself from the the Russia probe. At one point, the frustrated Trump said, "Where's my Roy Cohn?" according to The Times. In more alleged name calling, Trump refuted a February Washington Post story that he called Sessions "Mr. Magoo" and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "Mr. Peepers." The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr. Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr. Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will! The president said he needed a time machine. Because if he had known Sessions would take himself out of the Russia probe, Trump insisted he would have picked a different person for the job. "The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!," he tweeted. The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion! For the most part, Sessions simply had absorbed his public and reported private beatings by Trump. But on this one day, he fired back. "I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda," Sessions said in the statement. Hours earlier, the president had told "Fox & Friends" that Sessions "never took control of the Justice Department." "I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad," Trump told Hill.TV. "I'm disappointed in the attorney general for numerous reasons. But we have an attorney general. I'm disappointed in the attorney general for many reasons." One day after the GOP lost the House but held on to the Senate, Sessions announced he had tendered his resignation, at his boss' request. Trump was asked about Sessions' status with the administration during a press conference earlier in the day. He gave no clue that the attorney general was on his out way out the door. "We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date," Trump tweeted. ....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!

---split---25.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-suspends-credentials-cnn-correspondent-jim-acosta/story?id=59045396---split---The White House has suspended press access for CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Trump engaged in a heated exchange during a press conference on Wednesday, one day after the midterm elections. Acosta tweeted that the Secret Service barred him from entering White House grounds to shoot his 8 p.m. news broadcast. A video posted by Acosta on Twitter also shows that his credentials were confiscated.  I’ve just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit  "This is Jim Acosta. I am in front of the White House. Secret Service officer is asking for my hard pass," Acosta said on the video. "Obviously, no hard feelings to the officer, but I am now giving my hard pass to the Secret Service." The Secret Service agent could be heard on camera saying he "was just told to do it" and takes Acosta’s ID out of his lanyard.   The White House said in a statement that the reason Acosta was banned from the grounds is because he placed "his hands on" a White House intern during the press conference in the East Wing earlier in the day. "President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration," press secretary Sarah Sanders said in the statement. "We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern."   The testy back-and-forth began as Acosta attempted to ask Trump a question about the Russia investigation. "Honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better," Trump told Acosta.   After Trump said, "That's enough," a White House intern tried to grab the microphone from Acosta. As Acosta kept a firm grip of the microphone with his right hand, his left hand briefly came in contact with the inside of the woman's elbow as she reached over to grab it, video from the press conference shows. “Pardon me, ma’am,” Acosta told the intern during the encounter, before asking Trump if he was "concerned" that he may be indicted in the Russia investigation.   Before Acosta could finish the question, Trump cut him off, saying “I’m not concerned about anything with the Russian investigation because it’s a hoax. That’s enough. Put down the mic."   Visibly frustrated, Trump walked away from the podium for a few seconds before returning to admonish Acosta. “I tell you what. CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them,” Trump said. “You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN.”   As Acosta began to interject, Trump attempted to invite more questions from another reporter before speaking to Acosta again. “You’re a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible, and the way you treat other people is horrible. You shouldn’t treat people that way.” Trump then told Acosta to “sit down,” saying, “When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people." Sanders described the behavior the White House accused Acosta of displaying as "absolutely unacceptable" and said it was "disrespectful to the reporter’s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question." Sanders also defended Trump, saying he has "given the press more access than any President in history," and scolded CNN for being "proud" of Acosta. "Contrary to CNN’s assertions, there is no greater demonstration of the President’s support for a free press than the event he held today," Sanders said in a statement.   "Only they would attack the President for not being supportive of a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of an hour and a half – including several from the reporter in question. The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration." In a statement, CNN defended Acosta, accusing Sanders of lying and saying the suspension of his hard pass was "done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference." "This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better," CNN said. "Jim Acosta has our full support."  Tonight the White House revoked @Acosta’s press pass. CNN’s response to @PressSec and @realDonaldTrump: pic.twitter.com/EY2iFLvP3P  Other White House correspondents who were in the room also came to Acosta’s defense. When Trump turned to NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander, telling him, "Go ahead, Peter, go ahead," Alexander didn’t hesitate to compliment his colleague. "In Jim’s defense, I traveled with him in Washington, he’s a diligent reporter who busts his butt." "Well, I’m not a big fan of yours either, to be honest," Trump replied to Alexander. Reuters reporter Jeff Mason, who was seated next to Acosta, disputed the White House's claims that he placed his hands on the intern. He tweeted a photo of the incident, which he said depicts "what happened accurately."  I was seated next to ?@Acosta? at today’s press conference and did not witness him “placing his hands” on the young intern, as the White House alleges. He held on to the microphone as she reached for it. The ?@Reuters? pictures below depict what happened accurately. pic.twitter.com/nO68Hf4eQM  On Twitter, New York Times reporter Peter Baker called the White House’s actions a "false predicate to punish a reporter" and a "very bad sign."  Trump @PressSec confirms that White House has suspended the hard pass of a reporter because it doesn't like the way he does his job. This is something I've never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996. Other presidents did not fear tough questioning.  New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman recounted what she witnessed in the room, saying, "This was plain to see he was headed this way for a long time," after Trump's team would hand-pick which reporters could travel in their pool while campaigning for the 2016 election.  During the campaign, Trump team hand-picked which reporters could travel in his pool, which was not conventionally put together and did not widely distribute reports. This was plain to see he was headed this way for a long time. https://t.co/noagxLsNAD  An Oct. 29 tweet pinned to the top of Acosta's Twitter profile says, "We are not the enemy of the people."  We are not the enemy of the people. I am not your enemy. You are not my enemy. It is wrong to call your fellow Americans the enemy. We are all on the same team. We are all Americans.  This isn’t the first time that the White House has taken retaliatory action against a reporter and network after the administration felt they acted out of turn, and it isn’t the first time it’s happened to Acosta. On July 14, Sanders said a scheduled “State of the Union” interview with CNN and national security adviser John Bolton was canceled as a consequence of a back-and-forth between Acosta and Trump. The White House accused Acosta of disrespecting the president. "Instead of rewarding bad behavior, we decided to reprioritize the TV appearances for administration officials," Sanders tweeted in response to CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who said Trump "attacked CNN" during a presser he had recently held in the United Kingdom with Prime Minister Theresa May.  Actually a @CNN reporter disrespected @POTUS & PM May during their press conf. Instead of rewarding bad behavior, we decided to reprioritize the TV appearances for administration officials. https://t.co/58LaJH6WaD  During the press conference, Acosta had tried to ask Trump a question, to which Trump replied, “CNN is fake news. I don’t take questions from CNN." Acosta then responded by saying, "Since you attacked CNN, can I ask you a question?” defending CNN as a "real" network. Another incident occurred on June 12, when Trump warned Acosta to "be nice" and "be respectful" when he asked a question following appearance at the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In New York on Jan. 12, Acosta made a number of efforts to ask a question, in which Trump replied, "Your organization is terrible." "You're attacking us," Acosta said. "Can you give us a question?" Trump then told him, "Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. You are fake news."
---split---26.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-attorney-general_us_59373391e4b01fc18d3e8971---split---35 seats 435 seats Refreshing in :30: WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned at President Donald Trump’s request on Wednesday after enduring more than a year of criticism from a president enraged by the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, which allowed for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. “At your request, I am submitting my resignation,” Sessions wrote in a letter delivered to Trump’s chief of staff and released by the Justice Department on Wednesday afternoon. Sessions wrote that he had been “honored to serve as Attorney General and have worked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the Presidency.” In what read like a defense of his handling of the Russia probe, Sessions wrote that he had worked to “support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.” Trump tweeted the news Wednesday afternoon, announcing he was naming Matthew Whitaker, Sessions’ chief of staff, as acting attorney general. Whitaker now has oversight of the Mueller investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is no longer overseeing it, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman. Before he was Sessions’ chief of staff, Whitaker had written about limiting the Mueller probe, which he said could be a “witch hunt.” A Justice Department official said ethics officials have not yet reviewed whether Whitaker would have to recuse himself from any aspect of the Mueller probe given his prior commentary. “It is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,” Whitaker said in a statement on Wednesday evening. “Attorney General Sessions has been a dedicated public servant for over 40 years. It has been a privilege to work under his leadership. He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well,” Whitaker added. Sessions was an early supporter of Trump’s campaign and one of the first people nominated to his Cabinet. But the president grew publicly frustrated with Sessions’ leadership of the Justice Department, specifically his March 2017 decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged coordination with the Trump campaign. Shortly afterward, in May 2017, Rosenstein decided to appoint Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI’s Russia investigation ― a decision that also angered Trump. When the president first heard Sessions would not be overseeing the FBI’s Russia investigation, he went “ballistic,” according to ABC News. In June 2017, CNN reported that the attorney general had at one point offered his resignation following multiple tense conversations with the president. In a July 2017 interview with The New York Times, Trump labeled Sessions’ decision “very unfair to the president.” Trump’s frustration with Sessions became undeniable in late May of this year, when the president tweeted that he wished he hadn’t named Sessions as head of the Justice Department. The president’s remarks came a day after The New York Times reported that he’d asked Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia probe shortly after the attorney general announced it. Trump later pushed back, claiming that Sessions never told him he planned to recuse himself. The president aired his frustration with Sessions again a month later, when he criticized the attorney general’s handling of a House investigation into possible bias against Trump within the Justice Department. Trump took his critique of Sessions a step further in August, when he told a “Fox & Friends” host that his attorney general “never took control” of the Justice Department. Sessions fired back at Trump within hours, saying in a statement that he took control of the DOJ the day he was sworn in. He added that he has had “unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda” and said the DOJ wouldn’t bow under political pressure. “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,” Sessions said. The next day, Trump continued to attack Sessions, saying in a tweet that the attorney general should be going after Hillary Clinton. Trump’s numerous tweets about the probe have themselves become a part of the investigation, The New York Times reported. Mueller is determining whether social media posts might constitute obstruction of justice. Speculation that Sessions might be on his way out had ramped up ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections, with Trump hinting that sweeping changes were coming to the DOJ. Election Day saw the Democrats taking control of the House for the new Congress and promising a new level of oversight unlike what Trump has faced in his presidency so far. Republicans in the House have been reluctant to investigate Trump’s more controversial policies or to critically oversee the Russia probe. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has fiercely defended the president in the wake of the investigation. With Tuesday’s wins, the Democrats will gain subpoena power and are expected to double down on the probe. Shortly after the news of Sessions’ departure broke, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the timing of Trump’s announcement was “very suspect.” “Our paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one, should not be able to interfere with the Mueller investigation in any way,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill. The last tweet Trump sent before announcing the news Wednesday was about polling regarding the Mueller investigation: According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about! Sessions’ departure comes at one of the most turbulent times in the modern history of the Justice Department. Trump fired both acting Attorney General Sally Yates and FBI Director James Comey last year, with the latter move sparking Rosenstein’s decision to name a special counsel. Many key roles in the Justice Department remain unfilled. Trump has also repeatedly and publicly attacked Sessions, Rosenstein and the entire DOJ ― attacks Sessions did little to thwart and which have taken a considerable toll on morale at the department. In spite of attacks from the president, Sessions remained faithful in implementing many key aspects of Trump’s agenda. During his stint as the nation’s top law enforcement official, Sessions rolled back drug sentencing reforms, backed off federal investigations of local police departments, reversed an Obama-era policy that curtailed the Justice Department’s use of private prisons and relaxed restrictions on the use of civil asset forfeiture. He prioritized combating illegal immigration and getting tougher on crime, two issues Trump frequently highlighted as a candidate. Sessions is not alone in departing the Trump administration over the Russia scandal. In February 2017, national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. (He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.) Trump has also said that his decision to fire Comey was at least partly due to the probe. Prior to his brief tenure in the Trump administration, Sessions represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate for two decades. While he was serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama from 1981 to 1993, the Senate rejected Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship over concerns about his comments on race. This story has been updated with more details on the resignation and circumstances surrounding it. Antonia Blumberg, Lydia O’Connor, Sara Boboltz and Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.

---split---26.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/negative-trump-divided-issues-voters-reshuffle-cards-washington/story?id=59025819---split---A divided outcome, befitting a divided nation, came out of the 2018 midterms, with the House flipping Democratic, but the Senate staying Republican while voters were sharply split along partisan, ideological and demographic lines. The focus of the election, President Donald Trump, came in where he’s been since taking office: underwater in job approval, 45-54 percent, with strong critics outnumbering strong supporters by a 15-point margin in the national ABC News exit poll. But Trump’s approval rating among voters was no worse than Barack Obama’s in the 2014 and 2010 midterms (44 percent both times). It could’ve been worse for a president whose average approval before his first midterm is the lowest on record.     Voters said they were casting their ballots to show opposition rather than support for Trump, by a 12-point margin, 38 to 26 percent. A third of voters said Trump was not a factor -- and they voted Republican for the House by 52-44 percent, sapping some force from the "blue wave." The voters got what they wanted most: By 52-44 percent they preferred a Democratic rather than Republican-controlled House. And the Democrats flipped at least six governorships as well. But they got it with differences among groups that were as profound as ever, including, as analyzed for ABC by Langer Research Associates: • Women voted Democratic by 59-40 percent; men split 47-51 percent. That 23-point gender gap is the biggest in a national House vote in exit polls dating back to 1982 -- albeit by a single point. It was 22 points two years ago.   • Whites voted Republican by 54-44 percent; nonwhites voted Democratic by 76-22 percent. Demonstrating the changing racial and ethnic face of the nation, nonwhites accounted for 28 percent of voters, highest ever for a midterm and 1 point from the record in any election, set in 2016. Consider the change: Nonwhites accounted for 9 percent of voters in the 1990 midterms. • Young voters didn’t appreciably increase their turnout, but their vote preference was the most Democratic on record -- 67-32 percent. Seniors, twice as prevalent, split 48-50 percent. • College-educated white women voted Democratic by 59-39 percent, by far the widest margin on record. Non-college white men voted Republican by 66-32 percent, a point from the widest gap in a midterm election, in 2014. • Evangelical white Protestants, 26 percent of voters, voted Republican by 75-22 percent. Everyone else voted Democratic by 66-32 percent. • Urban residents voted Democratic by 2-to-1, 65-32 percent; rural and small city residents voted Republican by 56-42 percent. And the suburbs, home to half of voters, split dead evenly, 49-49 percent. No wonder, perhaps, that 76 percent of voters said the country is becoming more divided politically. On that, ironically, there was majority agreement: 86 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of independents shared this view.    On the issues, health care prevailed, cited as the country’s top challenge by 41 percent, vs. 23 percent for immigration, 22 percent for the economy and 10 percent for gun policy. It sharply split the vote: Health care voters went Democratic by 75-23 percent; immigration voters were precisely the opposite; economy voters voted Republican by almost 2-to-1, 63-34 percent; and gun policy voters went Democratic by well over 2-to-1, 70-29 percent. On health care, concern over coverage for pre-existing conditions rang a bell for the Democrats; voters by 57-35 percent trusted them over the Republicans to handle it.   On the economy, 68 percent said it’s in excellent or good shape, a dramatic turnaround from 2016, 2014 and 2010 -- but the impact at home was muted. Just 36 percent said their own finances have improved since Trump took office. As many said his trade policies have hurt their local economy as said they’ve helped, 29-25 percent. And it was a similar verdict on the Republican tax law: 29-22 percent, hurt-helped. There was other strong coffee for Trump and the GOP. As good as the economy is nationally, 54 percent of voters said the country’s headed seriously on the wrong track. Many more said Trump’s immigration policies are too tough than about right, 46-33 percent -- though 17 percent said they’re not tough enough. And voters by 46-38 percent said Trump’s approach to foreign policy is making the country less safe, not more safe. That said, Trump took some wins, as well, notably at special counsel Robert Mueller’s expense. After months of Trump’s hammering, 54 percent thought the Russia investigation was politically motivated. Eighty-two percent of Republicans said so and 28 percent of Democrats agreed.   A few other issues produced clear majorities. Voters by 66-25 percent said Roe v. Wade should be left “as is.” Fifty-nine percent favored stricter gun control measures. Seventy-eight percent called it important to elect more women to office; 72 percent said the same of racial and ethnic minorities. And 84 percent called sexual harassment a serious problem in this country. Yet there was far more disagreement than agreement in 2018 -- a highly likely omen for the 2020 presidential election ahead. All this -- and more -- played out differently state-by-state and race-by-race.   A summary of key races follows:  With no winner Wednesday morning, exit poll results were chock-full of reasons why the Arizona Senate race was so close. Voters 65 and older split evenly: 50-50 percent between the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally. Sinema was helped by a 27-point margin among moderates (63-36 percent) -– the largest pro-Democratic candidate margin in an Arizona Senate race in available exit poll data back to 1994. Yet McSally struck back by winning the 44 percent who said Trump wasn’t a factor in their vote, 58-42 percent. Trump’s approval rating was 52 percent in Arizona -- higher than his 45 percent nationally -– and McSally won those votes, 88-11 percent. But Sinema held a narrow edge in Arizona’s giant Maricopa County, 52-47 percent.    Shifts in vote preferences among key demographic groups denied any candidate an easy win. In the Senate race, again with no winner Wednesday morning, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson’s +12 advantage in 2012 shrunk to naught as he failed to maintain his margins among Hispanics and suburban voters, and lost men. He won 76 percent of health care-focused voters, but that was offset by those more focused on immigration and the economy. Republican Rick Scott gained 6 points among Hispanics and 8 points among small city and rural voters from his 2014 gubernatorial election. He also got to run on the economy’s coattails: Two-thirds of Florida voters said the economy was excellent or good, and they favored him by 18 points. Still, that only brought them to an even 50-50. Similar patterns emerged in the governor’s race, though Democrat Andrew Gillum’s early concession brought the race to an end. Gillum, an avowed progressive, was seen as too liberal by 46 percent, while Republican Ron DeSantis -- a Trump devotee -- was deemed too conservative by 34 percent. DeSantis won the suburbs by 7 points and rural areas by a whopping 42 points, while Gillum won the 43 percent who live in urban areas by 14 points. Regionally, Gillum took the Miami and Gold Coast areas, by 31 points, but lost every other region of the state. He was also not able to open up more space among nonwhites, who voted similarly this year as in 2014, when Democrat Charlie Crist narrowly lost to Republican Rick Scott.    In another still-unsettled race, Republican Brian Kemp was helped by a record 51-point margin among white voters in a Georgia gubernatorial race, 75-24 percent (albeit by +1 from 2014). Democrat Stacey Abrams benefited from record midterm turnout among nonwhite voters, 40 percent, as they overwhelmingly broke for her, 84-15 percent. Kemp won Georgia’s suburban voters by a wide margin, 57-42 percent -- suburban women (44-56 percent) and suburban men (40-58 percent) alike. Abrams won independents, 53-45 percent.    Democrat Joe Donnelly lost his re-election bid in the third most-Republican state in this year’s exit polls (which were conducted in 21 states). His 12-point margin among women against a weak opponent in 2012 shrunk to just 2 points. He ran evenly among men six years ago, but lost them by 17 points this year. Donnelly even lost votes among urban voters in Indianapolis, going from a 34-point margin to 20 points. Trump and native son Mike Pence were popular here, 55 percent approval and 54 percent favorability, respectively. The Democratic strategy of promoting Libertarian Lucy Brenton may have backfired; she pulled away more liberals, 6 percent, vs. 4 percent of moderates and 2 percent of conservatives.    Women propelled Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to become the state’s second female governor. While Hillary Clinton lost white women by 8 points in Michigan in 2016, Whitmer won them by a 7-point margin, 53-46 percent. She also won independents by 5 points -– a group that backed Trump by 16 points in the state 2016. Voters were significantly more likely to say she was able to handle the issue of safe drinking water than Republican Bill Schuette, 56-31 percent. She also won big among the plurality of Michigan voters (44 percent) who named health care as the most important issue facing the country, 74-23 percent.  Democrat Mike Espy and incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith are headed to a runoff after ending the multi-candidate night in a dead heat, 41-41 percent, with Republican Chris McDaniel taking a consequential 16 percent of the vote in the Mississippi special election. Though 65 percent of Trump approvers (59 percent of the electorate) voted for Hyde-Smith, a substantial 27 percent voted for McDaniel. He also won a quarter of Republicans and conservatives, keeping Hyde-Smith well below the majority threshold needed to avoid a runoff. For his part, Espy won four-in-10 independents, a new high for a Democrat in sporadic exit polls since 1984, though far short of the share he needed to swing the deeply red state. And at 33 percent, the turnout among blacks was a bit short of its 2012 level, 35 percent. In a test two-way matchup, voters split 41-53 percent between Espy and Hyde-Smith.  Republican challenger Josh Hawley’s Senate victory relied on a large advantage in the suburbs, 57-42 percent, and an even bigger advantage in small cities and rural areas, 71-27 percent. Hawley won men by 15 points, 57-42 percent; in McCaskill’s last race she won men by 8 points. The healthy economy helped Hawley; 42 percent said they’re better off financially than two years ago, and they backed him 79-21 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. McCaskill won adults 18 to 44 years old, but their turnout -– 36 percent of Missouri voters –- wasn’t enough to hold her seat.  The Montana Senate race was undecided by Wednesday morning, in part because voters preferred a Republican-controlled Senate by 50-42 percent, yet retained some affection for incumbent Democrat Jon Tester. Despite Trump’s multiple visits to the state, 54 percent -- more than anywhere else -- said Trump was not a factor in how they voted, and Tester won that group by 57-42 percent. His vote against Brett Kavanaugh may also have played a role; Rosendale won by 20 points among the 67 percent of voters who said it was a factor in their vote. Tester doubled his 2012 winning margin among women (58-39 percent) and quintupled his margin among voters under 30 years old (70-27 percent), though the exit poll indicated that he was essentially even with Rosendale among nonwhites, a group Tester carried by 42 points in his last victory.    Democrat Jacky Rosen's victory came from women -- she won them by 21 points, 58-37 percent. Republican incumbent Dean Heller had held his losses among women to 6 points in 2012. Moreover, while Heller won independents by 20 points in 2012, he lost them this year by 22 points, 58-36 percent. Nonwhites accounted for 38 percent of Nevada voters, a record in midterms in the state, and Rosen won them by 68-28 percent. Rosen focused on health care, the top issue to 39 percent of voters, and won them by 79-18 percent.  Only a minority of voters said Democrat incumbent Bob Menendez has high ethical standards (30 percent), and 64 percent rated him unfavorably. Yet he won in solidly blue New Jersey nonetheless, with help from the 51 percent of voters who were looking to flip the Senate. Menendez won big over Republican Bob Hugin among liberals (86-10 percent), but lost some ground among moderates, winning them by 14 points, down from 24 points in 2012.    Democrat incumbent Heidi Heitkamp was unseated by Republican Kevin Cramer in a state where six in 10 voters approved of Trump –- second-highest across exit polls this year. Heitkamp was seen as too liberal by 45 percent, while Cramer was seen as too conservative by fewer, 39 percent. Her vote against confirming Kavanaugh also played against her –- 42 percent said it was important in their vote and nearly two-thirds of them backed Cramer.  Seventy-four percent of voters said the nation’s economy is in good shape –- up from 34 percent when Trump won the state in 2016 –- and these voters went for Republican Mike DeWine over Democrat Richard Cordray by 29 points, 64-35 percent. Ohio voters were relatively pro-Trump (52-47 percent) compared with the nation as a whole (45-54 percent); his approvers backed DeWine by 89-10 percent. DeWine won big among constituencies that lifted Trump to victory, including whites (+16 points), men (+20), rural residents (+30) and non-college white men (+38).    Fifty-eight percent of Tennessee voters preferred Republican control of the Senate, helping to propel Republican Marsha Blackburn over Democrat Phil Bredesen. It was one of the top states to favor Republican control (alongside Mississippi and North Dakota.) Blackburn also benefitted from strong personal popularity, rated favorably by 55 percent vs. Bredesen’s 49 percent. While 37 percent said Blackburn’s views are too conservative, more said Bredesen’s are too liberal, 45 percent. Thirty-eight percent said they cast their vote to show support for Trump, vs. 24 percent voting to oppose him.    Record turnouts among nonwhites (44 percent) and Latinos (26 percent) in exit polls since 1984 weren’t enough to for Democrat Beto O'Rourke. Whites, 56 percent of the electorate, voted for incumbent Republican Ted Cruz by a broad 32-point margin, 66-34 percent. Men also kept the Republican stronghold red, voting for Cruz by 56-43 percent, compared women’s 8-point margin, 54-46 percent, for O’Rourke. Among the 61 percent of Texas voters who live in gun households, Cruz won by 63-36 percent. Lastly, dispelling myths that the growing out-of-state population is turning the state blue, native Texans split 51-48 percent, O’Rourke-Cruz, compared with a 15-point margin for Cruz among those who moved to the state.  Democrat Joe Manchin won re-election in Trump’s best 2016 state -- despite the fact that Trump’s 63 percent job approval rating was highest here in the 21 states where exit polls were conducted. A plurality, 40 percent, said Trump was not a factor in their vote, and Manchin won them by 54-41 percent over Republican Patrick Morrisey. Manchin also benefited from higher personal popularity than Morrisey; 49 percent vs. 38 percent. Forty-one percent called health care the top issue (of four) in their vote, and they went for Manchin by 51 points.    A 52-45 percent win among political independents enabled Democrat Tony Evers to unseat Republican Scott Walker. So did three-quarters support for Evers among nonwhites, whose 17 percent turnout was their largest in available Wisconsin midterm exit polls since 1994. (Walker won whites, 54-45 percent.) Forty-eight percent supported Walker’s signature 2011 law eliminating most collective bargaining for public employees, vs. 38 percent who opposed it. But it wasn’t enough to win Walker a third term.

---split---29.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/sessions-resigns.html---split---Supported by By Peter Baker, Katie Benner and Michael D. Shear WASHINGTON — President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, replacing him with a loyalist who has echoed the president’s complaints about the special counsel investigation into Russia’s election interference and will now take charge of the inquiry. Mr. Sessions delivered his resignation letter to the White House at the request of the president, who tapped Matthew G. Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff, as acting attorney general, raising questions about the future of the inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Whitaker, a former college football tight end and United States attorney in Iowa, and a onetime Senate candidate in that state, has previously questioned the scope of the investigation. In a column for CNN last year, he wrote that Mr. Mueller would be going too far if he examined the Trump family’s finances. “This would raise serious concerns that the special counsel’s investigation was a mere witch hunt,” Mr. Whitaker wrote, echoing the president’s derisive description of the investigation. Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia. Until now, Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, oversaw the investigation because Mr. Sessions recused himself in March 2017, citing his active role in Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats quickly demanded on Wednesday that Mr. Whitaker also remove himself from taking charge of the inquiry, citing potential conflicts of interest, including his criticisms of the Mueller investigation, as well as his connections to a witness in that investigation, Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign aide. In 2014, Mr. Whitaker was the chairman of Mr. Clovis’s unsuccessful campaign to become Iowa state treasurer. “Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. Justice Department ethics advisers may be asked to weigh whether Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself. If he were to agree to do that, Mr. Rosenstein would continue to oversee the special counsel. [Read our profile from September of the acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker.] Mr. Whitaker had no immediate plans to publicly comment about Mr. Mueller or to take actions regarding the Russia inquiry, an administration official said. “I am committed to leading a fair department with the highest ethical standards that upholds the rule of law and seeks justice for all Americans,” Mr. Whitaker said on Wednesday in a statement in which he also called Mr. Sessions “a man of integrity.” But as acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker would be in a position to impede or undermine the investigation or to block Mr. Mueller from delivering a final report on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign, and whether the president tried to cover it up. Any such step could set off a dramatic clash with the new Democratic majority in the House. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who will become the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was one of several Democrats to promise investigations once the party takes control in January. “The American people understand that no person is above the law and have demanded accountability from their government,” Mr. Nadler said. “The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable. This must begin immediately, and if not, then a Democratic Congress will make this a priority in January.” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who could become the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that any interference with the Mueller investigation “would cause a constitutional crisis and undermine the rule of law.” But Republicans in Congress appeared less concerned by the president’s move. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who said in 2017 that there would be “holy hell to pay” if Mr. Trump fired his attorney general, offered no criticism of the president on Wednesday. “I look forward to working with President Trump to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice,” Mr. Graham said. He had in recent months begun to ease off his stance of last year, saying in August that it had become clear that Mr. Sessions had lost the president’s confidence. The firing of Mr. Sessions came a day after midterm elections that handed control of the House to Democrats, dealing a major blow to Mr. Trump for the final two years of his term. Republicans preserved their hold on the Senate and increased their majority slightly, making it likelier that Mr. Trump would be able to confirm a replacement. But House Democrats have made clear that they plan to use the subpoena power that will come with their majority to reopen the lower chamber’s own investigation into the Russia matter. The abrupt ouster of Mr. Sessions resembled in some ways the decision by President George W. Bush to oust Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in 2006 the day after a similar electoral defeat in midterm elections. In that case, Mr. Bush was attempting to mollify his critics. Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Sessions appeared likely to inflame his adversaries on Capitol Hill. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, called Mr. Sessions before the president’s postelection news conference on Wednesday to tell the attorney general that Mr. Trump wanted him to step down, the administration official said. Mr. Trump, who did not speak with Mr. Sessions himself, then ducked questions about Mr. Sessions’s fate at the news conference. Mr. Sessions then had his letter, which was undated, delivered to the White House. “Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation,” he wrote. He added, “Most importantly, in my time as attorney general we have restored and upheld the rule of law,” and thanked the president. Mr. Trump announced the resignation and Mr. Whitaker’s assignment on Twitter. “We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!” he wrote. “A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.” Though Mr. Trump has said for months that he wished to replace Mr. Sessions, lawmakers and administration officials believed that firing the attorney general before the midterm elections would have had negative consequences for Republicans in tight races. So it came as little surprise when Mr. Sessions was asked to resign the day after the midterms were over. The president’s decision ended a partnership that soured almost from the start of the administration and degenerated into one of the most acrimonious public standoffs between a commander in chief and a senior cabinet member in modern American history. Only weeks after he was confirmed as the United States’ top law enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Justice Department investigation in March 2017, after revelations that he had failed to report encounters with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak of Russia during the 2016 campaign. At the time, Mr. Sessions said there was nothing nefarious about those meetings, though he acknowledged that he “should have slowed down” and been more thoughtful in denying any contacts with Russian officials during his Senate confirmation process. His recusal was one of his first public acts as attorney general. Mr. Trump never forgave him. At various points, he called Mr. Sessions “beleaguered,” “VERY weak” and “DISGRACEFUL.” In private, he referred to him derisively as “Mr. Magoo,” after the befuddled cartoon character. In an interview with The New York Times in July of 2017, Mr. Trump first publicly revealed his anger with Mr. Sessions, kicking off 16 months of public fury toward his attorney general by saying he would not have hired Mr. Sessions had he known he would hand off oversight of the Russia inquiry. “How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office interview. “If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to take you.’ It’s extremely unfair, and that’s a mild word, to the president.” Mr. Trump also publicly badgered Mr. Sessions to open investigations into his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton, and other Democrats. Critics from both parties said the president was shredding the traditional independence of the law enforcement agencies in seeking what appeared to be politically motivated prosecutions. For the most part, Mr. Sessions made no public retort. But after the president chided him in February for leaving an inquiry into the F.B.I.’s handling of the Russia investigation to an inspector general rather than conducting his own review, Mr. Sessions pushed back. “As long as I am the attorney general,” he said, “I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor.” When Mr. Trump said in August that Mr. Sessions “never took control of the Justice Department,” Mr. Sessions fired back, saying in a rare public rebuke that “the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.” Mr. Sessions tried to quit at least twice. In June 2017, shortly after his recusal, Mr. Trump berated Mr. Sessions during a private meeting in the Oval Office and accused him of “disloyalty.” Mr. Sessions grew emotional and agreed to resign. Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff, later said he ran out of the building to find the attorney general in the parking lot and stop him from leaving. The deputy attorney general, now Mr. Rosenstein, would normally be in line to become the acting attorney general, but Mr. Trump has complained publicly about Mr. Rosenstein, too. Installing Mr. Whitaker could clear the way for Mr. Trump to force out Mr. Mueller. To dismiss a special counsel, the president has to order the attorney general or, in the case of a recusal, the deputy attorney general, to carry it out. Mr. Rosenstein has said that he sees no justification to dismiss Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director originally overseeing the investigation. During his new conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump again insisted that he had the right to order an end to the investigation. “I could’ve ended it anytime I wanted,” he said. “I didn’t. There was no collusion. There was no anything.” But he did not rule it out. “It should end because it’s very bad for our country,” he said. Mr. Whitaker’s ascendance to the top of the Justice Department shows how much loyalty means to Mr. Trump. The president has long regarded Mr. Whitaker as his eyes and ears inside a department that he considers an enemy institution. Mr. Whitaker has been a frequent White House visitor and served as what one White House aide called a “balm” on the relationship between the president and the Justice Department. In pushing out his attorney general, the president cast aside one of his earliest and strongest supporters. In February 2016, Mr. Sessions became the first sitting senator to endorse Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, and in the months leading up to the election, he became one of the candidate’s closest national security advisers and a key architect of the president’s hard-line immigration agenda. As attorney general, Mr. Sessions has been instrumental in putting that agenda into practice, leading the assault on protections for young immigrants, ordering a “zero tolerance” crackdown on migrant families at the border, and helping to orchestrate changes aimed at severely reducing legal and illegal immigration. Working with Stephen Miller, the president’s top domestic policy adviser, Mr. Sessions helped shape the president’s dark immigration message during the midterm elections, pushing for new efforts to separate families at the border, elimination of birthright citizenship, and more aggressive efforts to counter a caravan of migrants heading toward the United States from Central America. He also fought for tougher sentencing for criminals, challenged so-called sanctuary cities and pursued the MS-13 gang. But despite arguably being the most effective of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members on issues that the president deeply cared about, Mr. Sessions never recovered from Mr. Trump’s anger over his recusal in the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions, 71, got his start in politics as a United States attorney in Alabama, but his nomination for a federal judgeship was blocked by the Senate amid charges of racial insensitivity. He mounted a comeback by winning election as the state attorney general and then, in 1996, to the Senate. Rebecca R. Ruiz contributed reporting.    A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

---split---33.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Most still want U.S. as top global power, but see China on the rise By Richard Wike, Bruce Stokes, Jacob Poushter, Laura Silver, Janell Fetterolf and Kat Devlin America’s global image plummeted following the election of President Donald Trump, amid widespread opposition to his administration’s policies and a widely shared lack of confidence in his leadership. Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election approaches, a new 25-nation Pew Research Center survey finds that Trump’s international image remains poor, while ratings for the United States are much lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency. The poll also finds that international publics express significant concerns about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it used to. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well, including the fact that, while the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago. Even though America’s image has declined since Trump’s election, on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% offer an unfavorable rating. However, a median of only 27% say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs; 70% lack confidence in him. Frustrations with the U.S. in the Trump era are particularly common among some of America’s closest allies and partners. In Germany, where just 10% have confidence in Trump, three-in-four people say the U.S. is doing less these days to address global problems, and the share of the public who believe the U.S. respects personal freedoms is down 35 percentage points since 2008. In France, only 9% have confidence in Trump, while 81% think the U.S. doesn’t consider the interests of countries like France when making foreign policy decisions. Critical views are also widespread among America’s closest neighbors. Only 25% of Canadians rate Trump positively, more than six-in-ten (63%) say the U.S. is doing less than in the past to address global problems, and 82% think the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making policy. Meanwhile, Trump’s lowest ratings on the survey are found in Mexico, where just 6% express confidence in his leadership. One exception to this pattern is Israel. After a year in which the Trump administration generated international controversy by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, his positive rating jumped to 69%, up from 56% in 2017. Around the world, publics are divided about the direction of American power: Across the 25 nations surveyed, a median of 31% say the U.S. plays a more important role in the world today than it did ten years ago; 25% say it plays a less important role; and 35% believe the U.S. is as important as it was a decade ago. In contrast, views about Chinese power are clear: A median of 70% say China’s role on the world stage has grown over the past 10 years. Still, by a slim margin, more people name the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power (a median of 39% say the U.S., 34% say China). And despite the unease many feel about the U.S. at the moment, the idea of a U.S.-led world order is still attractive to most. When asked which would be better for the world, having China or the U.S. as the top global power, people in nearly every country tend to select the U.S., and this is particularly common among some of China’s Asia-Pacific neighbors, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Australia. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to Aug. 12, 2018. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 use additional data from a Pew Research Center survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted from May 14 to June 15, 2018. Although perceptions of the U.S. are on balance positive, they vary considerably among the nations surveyed. Ten of the 25 countries in this year’s survey are European Union member states, and across these EU nations a median of just 43% offer a favorable opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, majorities in four of the five Asia-Pacific nations polled give the U.S. a positive rating, including 83% in the Philippines, one of the highest ratings in the survey. The U.S. also gets high marks in South Korea, where 80% have a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in President Trump has increased over the past year from 17% to 44%. As has largely been the case since Pew Research Center’s first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, attitudes toward the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa are largely positive, with Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans expressing mostly favorable opinions in this year’s poll. The three Latin American nations polled offer differing views about the U.S., with Brazilians voicing mostly favorable reviews, while Argentines and Mexicans are mostly negative. And the two Middle Eastern nations in the study – Israel and Tunisia – offer strikingly different assessments. The country giving the U.S. its lowest rating in the survey, and the place where the biggest drop in U.S. favorability has taken place over the past year, is Russia. Just 26% of Russians have a favorable opinion of the U.S., compared with 41% in 2017. A 55% majority of Russians say relations have gotten worse in the past year, and the share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53% to 19%. The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders, and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five. A median of 70% across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews. In contrast, opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive. Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU, although there are regional divides within Europe, with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe. European attitudes toward Trump are strikingly negative, especially when compared with the ratings his predecessor received while in office. Looking at four European nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently since 2003 reveals a clear pattern regarding perceptions of American presidents. George W. Bush, whose foreign policies were broadly unpopular in Europe, got low ratings during his presidency, while the opposite was true for Barack Obama, who enjoyed strong approval in these four nations during his time in office. Following the 2016 election, confidence in the president plunged, with Trump’s ratings resembling what Bush received near the end of his second term (although Trump’s numbers are up slightly in the United Kingdom this year). In several European nations, Trump receives higher ratings from supporters of right-wing populist parties. For example, among people in the UK who have a favorable view of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), 53% express confidence in Trump, compared with only 21% among those with an unfavorable view of UKIP. Similar divides exist among supporters and detractors of right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. However, it is worth noting that, other than in the UK, there is no European country in which more than half of right-wing populist party supporters say they have confidence in Trump. A common criticism about American foreign policy over the past decade and a half has been that the U.S. only looks after its own interests in world affairs, ignoring the interests of other nations. As Pew Research Center surveys showed, this belief was especially prevalent during George W. Bush’s presidency, when many around the world thought the U.S. was pursuing unilateralist, and unpopular, policies. Strong opposition to the Iraq War and other elements of Bush’s foreign policy led to rising complaints about the U.S. acting alone and ignoring the interests and concerns of other nations. Opinions shifted following Barack Obama’s election, with more people saying the U.S. considers their country’s interest, although even during the Obama years the prevailing global sentiment was that the U.S. doesn’t necessarily consider other countries. Now, the Trump presidency has brought an increase in the number of people in many nations saying the U.S. essentially doesn’t listen to countries like theirs when making foreign policy. This pattern is especially pronounced among some of America’s top allies and partners. For instance, while the share of the French public who believe the U.S. considers their national interest has not been very high at any point over the past decade and a half, it reached a low point near the end of Bush’s second term (11% in 2007), rose somewhat during Obama’s presidency (35% in 2013) and has declined once more under Trump. Today, just 18% in France say the U.S. considers the interests of countries like theirs when making policy. America’s reputation as a defender of individual liberty has generally been strong in Pew Research Center surveys since we first started asking about it in 2008. The prevailing view among the publics surveyed has typically been that the U.S. government respects the personal liberties of its people, and that is true again in this year’s poll. However, this opinion has become less common over time, and the decline has been particularly sharp among key U.S. partners in Europe, North America and Asia. The decline began during the Obama administration following revelations about the National Security Agency’s electronic eavesdropping on communications around the world, and it has continued during the first two years of the Trump presidency. The drop is especially prominent in Western Europe, where the share of the public saying Washington respects personal freedom has declined sharply since 2013. The same pattern is found among several other U.S. allies as well, including Canada, where the percentage saying the U.S. respects individual freedom has dropped from 75% to 38% since 2013, and Australia, where it has gone from 72% to 45%. Respondents to the survey were read a list of seven major nations, and for each one, were asked whether they think it is playing a more important, less important, or as important of a role in the world compared with 10 years ago. Among the seven countries tested, China stands apart: A median of 70% across the nations polled say Beijing plays a more important role today than a decade ago. Half or more in 23 of 25 countries express this view. Many also say this about Russia. A median of 41% believe Moscow’s role on the world stage has grown over the past decade, and majorities hold this view in Greece, Israel, Tunisia and Russia itself. Overall, people are split on whether Germany’s role is greater than it was 10 years ago or about the same, but many in Europe see Germany’s role as more influential. On the other hand, Europeans are particularly likely to think the UK is less important now. There is no real consensus in views of America’s prominence in world affairs. A median of 35% believe it is as important as it was 10 years ago, while 31% say it is more important and 25% say less. Japan is the only country with a majority saying that Washington plays a less important role. Meanwhile, Israelis, Nigerians and Kenyans are particularly likely to think the U.S. is more important than it used to be. In addition to being asked about whether major powers are rising, falling or staying about the same, respondents were asked the following question about whether they would prefer the U.S. or China to be the top global power: “Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world: the U.S. is the world’s leading power or China is the world’s leading power?” Results show that the U.S. is overwhelmingly the top choice. The U.S. is named more often than China in every country surveyed except three: Argentina, Tunisia and Russia, although in many nations significant numbers volunteer that it would be good for the world if both or neither were the leading power. Some of America’s allies in Asia and elsewhere are particularly likely to prefer a future in which the U.S. is the top global power. Two-thirds or more hold this opinion in Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK.  Findings from Germany, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Israel illustrate key patterns and major differences in how foreign publics view the U.S. in 2018. Germany stands out as a country where America’s image is considerably more negative today than during the Barack Obama era. Whereas Obama was extremely popular in Germany (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA scandal), only around one-in-ten Germans have voiced confidence in Trump in each of the past two years, ratings similar to those registered for George W. Bush at the end of his second term. Germany stands out on other measures as well. It is the country with the highest percentage (80%) saying relations with the U.S. have deteriorated over the past year, and it is tied with Sweden for the largest share of the public (75%) saying the U.S. is doing less to confront global problems. Germany is also where the biggest declines have taken place in recent years regarding the belief that the U.S. respects personal freedom and that Washington listens to other countries in international affairs. Mexico is where Trump gets his lowest ratings on the survey: Just 6% in the United States’ southern neighbor have confidence in him. Last year, more than nine-in-ten Mexicans opposed Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year, 66% in Mexico say relations have gotten worse over the past 12 months. Just 39% of Canadians express a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2018, the lowest percentage since Pew Research Center began polling in Canada in 2002. Only 25% have confidence in Trump, although he gets more positive ratings among those who feel closest to the Conservative Party (44%) than among those who identify with the New Democratic Party (17%) or the ruling Liberal Party (10%). Fully 82% say the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making foreign policy. Japanese trust in the U.S. president has also suffered under Donald Trump, but America’s overall image has not. In 2018, just three-in-ten Japanese say they have confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs, a slight improvement over their view in 2017, but significantly lower than their views of the U.S. president throughout the Obama administration. Opinion of Trump is comparable to sentiment about George W. Bush during his time in office. Fully 67% of Japanese, however, have a favorable view of the U.S., up 10 percentage points from last year. Despite the high ratings for the U.S., there are concerns in Japan about the trajectory of American power – it is the only country where a majority (55%) believes the U.S. is less powerful than 10 years ago. Confidence in President Trump has increased significantly in Israel since 2017. Trump also receives substantially higher ratings than Obama got near the end of his second term, although they are very similar to the high ratings for Obama in 2014, before tensions rose between his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. As has been the case in recent years, around eight-in-ten Israelis express a favorable opinion about the U.S. At 52%, Israelis are more likely than any other public surveyed to say the U.S. is doing more to address global problems than a few years ago. Israel also tops the list in terms of the share of the public (79%) saying that relations with the U.S. have improved in the past year. The rest of the report delves into these and other findings in more detail. Chapter 1 explores overall attitudes toward the U.S., America’s approach to foreign policy, whether the U.S. government respects individual liberty, and relations between survey countries and the U.S. Chapter 2 examines ratings for President Trump and other world leaders. Chapter 3 looks at opinions regarding whether specific major nations are playing a more or less important role in world affairs than in the past. Chapter 4 explores views about the balance of power between the U.S. and China, while Chapter 5 examines China’s global image.  Use the tool below to explore how individual countries view the U.S. and its president, and how these views have changed over time. Keep in mind that surveys are not conducted in every country for every year. But the patterns over time should be clear, since this interactive includes all available data for the 25 countries on these two questions.

USA TODAY Sessions speaks at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia on July 21, 2017. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday after a yearlong public shaming campaign that raised questions about whether the president improperly interfered with the Justice Department’s inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump, who requested Sessions' resignation, named Matthew Whitaker to serve as interim attorney general. Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff and had been considered for a variety of jobs in the Trump administration, including the No. 2 post at Justice or as White House counsel. In his new role, Whitaker also will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, prompting fears among Democratic lawmakers that Trump was seeking to derail the inquiry as it nears an end. "Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as attorney general of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country," Sessions said in a seven-paragraph letter. "I have done so to the best of my ability to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice." Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been overseeing Mueller's investigation until Whitaker's appointment, was at the White House on Wednesday afternoon for a meeting, though he remained in his job. He was among those in an entourage of Justice leaders who accompanied Sessions as he exited the department for the last time Wednesday night. An emotional Sessions clasped hands with Rosenstein and Whitaker, waved at a hastily gathered crowd in the department's courtyard, then climbed in the backseat of a black SUV with his security detail for the ride home. In a statement later Wednesday, Whitaker called his appointment a "true honor." "I am committed to leading a fair department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans," Whitaker said. He described Sessions as "a dedicated public servant." "It has been a privilege to work under his leadership," Whitaker said. "He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well.” More: Who is Matthew Whitaker? Hawkeye football star and federal prosecutor becomes acting attorney general More: Read Jeff Sessions' resignation letter: 'Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President' The departure of Sessions, one of Trump’s most vocal and earliest supporters during the 2016 campaign, was expected for weeks. Laser-focused on Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, Trump savaged him in interviews, tweets and news conferences as "beleaguered," often expressing "disappointment" in his attorney general. In September, Trump took his criticism to a new level when he disassociated Sessions from the administration, including the attorney general's border enforcement efforts. “I don’t have an attorney general. It’s very sad,” Trump said in an interview with Hill.TV. “I’m not happy at the border, I’m not happy with numerous things, not just this.” The broadsides became even more pointed in recent weeks, when Trump described Sessions as "disgraceful" for asking the Justice Department's inspector general – not prosecutors – to review Republican allegations of surveillance abuses related to the monitoring of a former Trump campaign aide. Sessions’ recusal in March 2017 for failing to disclose election-year meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak – and Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 – prompted the appointment of Mueller, a former FBI director, as the Justice Department’s special counsel to direct the wide-ranging Russia inquiry. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Mueller’s appointment and the inquiry's expansion to include a deep examination of the Trump family’s finances and possible obstruction of justice stoked the president’s attacks on the attorney general. "I think you have to ask the question of who benefits from Sessions’ removal," said Jimmy Gurule, who was an assistant attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. "And the answer is President Trump." Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, credited Sessions with “maintaining unusual equanimity and dignity under fire” while dutifully carrying out Trump’s agenda on a range of issues, including immigration and violent crime enforcement. "He’s done all this under enormous pressure, and we know what that is," Mukasey told USA TODAY, referring to unrelenting criticism from the president. "I can’t imagine how he’s been able to do this." Mukasey, a Sessions confidant whose portrait hangs in the attorney general’s fifth-floor conference room, characterized the atmosphere created by Trump’s public attacks as akin to a “psychodrama.” Rather than walk away in the face of Trump's attacks, Mukasey said, Sessions remained at the helm of the sprawling agency "for the welfare of the department." "For him to have done that is incredible," Mukasey said. In July 2017, Trump told The New York Times he would never have appointed the former Alabama senator had he known Sessions would disqualify himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. He repeated the line in a Rose Garden news conference the following week. "If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else," Trump said. "So I think that's a bad thing, not for the president but for the presidency." The president called his own attorney general "beleaguered," slammed him for failing to investigate former political opponent Hillary Clinton and questioned the significance of his early loyalty during the campaign.

Analysis: Trump's demand for AG Jeff Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton is an ethical minefield Analysis: At the six-month milestone, can Trump turn around his struggling presidency? As tensions rose in the months after his recusal decision, Sessions offered the president his resignation, but it was not accepted. Sessions’ actions were called into question after his contentious confirmation hearing in January 2017. During questioning, Sessions failed to disclose at least two meetings with Kislyak in 2016 and a third encounter that the attorney general said he did not remember. The meetings with Kislyak, first disclosed by The Washington Post, triggered Sessions’ decision to disqualify himself. Sessions said he did not discuss campaign-related issues and Trump policy matters with the Russian ambassador. On July 21, the Post reported, based on U.S. intercepts of Kislyak’s contacts with Moscow, that the ambassador said Sessions engaged in substantial discussions of campaign-related and policy issues. Sessions has not publicly addressed the report. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, called for Sessions to testify before the committee about the contents of the report. Republicans rallied to Sessions’ side in the wake of Trump's early rebukes. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the attorney general’s loyalty to the president was unwavering, having stood by candidate Trump even when audio recordings emerged in October 2016 of Trump's crude recounting of his treatment of women. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sessions was “central’’ to pushing the Trump campaign’s conservative agenda. Cracks in that bedrock of support appeared as early as January when House Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio called for the attorney general to step down. The congressmen, citing Sessions' recusal from the Russia inquiry, asserted that the attorney general could no longer adequately manage the department and the FBI. Gingrich and Grassley more recently signaled that their support for Sessions was waning. This year, another former Senate colleague and supporter, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., declared the Trump-Sessions relationship as "beyond repair," fueling speculation that Graham might be in line for the job. He denied any interest in the post. The criticism came even as Sessions aggressively pursued the staunchly conservative agenda Trump outlined on the campaign trail. He called attention to spikes in violent crime; ordered a sweeping review of police agreements that punished troubled agencies; rolled back a series of Obama-era civil rights actions, including a Justice Department challenge to a controversial voter identification law in Texas; and threatened so-called sanctuary cities for harboring undocumented immigrants. In January, the attorney general paved the way for tougher marijuana enforcement when he rescinded the previous administration's policy of noninterference with state laws allowing the use of medical and recreational pot. Sessions pushed the president’s immigration enforcement policy – the centerpiece of Trump’s successful campaign. Announcing a new set of requirements for cities to maintain eligibility for millions in federal grants, Sessions said jurisdictions would have to provide federal immigration authorities access to all detention centers to determine the status of suspected undocumented immigrants. The crackdown drew the ire of immigration and human rights advocates but brought plaudits from his conservative colleagues. "I have total confidence in the attorney general," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in September.

In fact, the home is in Lakeside, Calif. In the original broadcast of this game, we said, "It's a genuine Veg-O-Matic from Ron Popeil, donated by his daughter after his death." Ron Popeil is not dead. The Veg-O-Matic is from inventor Samuel Popeil – Samuel's daughter Lisa donated the Veg-O-Matic after her father's death. Samuel Popeil's son, Ron Popeil, who founded Ronco Inventions and popularly marketed the device, is still alive. An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed and misspelled Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba's name as Jennifer Gonzalez, and incorrectly listed her age as 29. She was 32.

His story asserted that Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to be the next CIA director, played a role in the treatment of al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah during interrogations at a "black site" in Thailand and that she had "mocked" Zubaydah. On March 15, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology. Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment. During this report, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded. She did run that site for a time after the Sept. 11 attacks, but as ProPublica has now acknowledged in a retraction of its reporting, she was not there when Zubaydah was waterboarded. In a previous version of this story, the quote referring to building the next generation was incorrectly attiributed to Kit Golan. It was actually Dylan Kapit who said that. In the audio, as in a previous Web version of the story, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Rick Saccone was among the local politicians attending the event. Two House Democrats subsequently alleged that Zinke used federal dollars to promote Saccone's candidacy; they called for an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which handles ethics cases.

Additionally, those versions said Brown had served time in prison for being part of Anonymous.

And in the audio, as in the previous Web version, Brown's project is called Pursuant. The actual name of the project is Pursuance. Also, in the audio version we say that Stratfor was involved in top-secret government missions like the killing of Osama bin Laden.

A previous version of this story misspelled the names of Alexia Paganini and Sofia Goggia. This post had also suggested that 2,646 athletes wouldn't win medals – an incorrect total that does not account for the multiple medals given out in sports with more than one competitor. It's still accurate that most of the 2,952 athletes who compete in the 2018 Winter Games will not earn a medal. A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Edgar Degas as Edward Degas.

In a previous version of this story, Lizzy Devine's last name was misspelled as Divine. In an earlier version of this story, NPR stated that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., occurred in 2010. It was 2012. An earlier version of this story spelled Adolf Hitler's first name as Adolph. In a previous version of this story, Lizzy Devine's last name was misspelled as Divine. A previous Web introduction to this story referred to 18 school shootings. While 18 shootings have taken place on school property, not all of them were described as targeted events. In a previous audio version of this story, we incorrectly said there has never been a female school shooter. In fact, there have been some females who committed school shootings. A previous version of this story stated that the U.S. rate of gun deaths should be 20 percent lower based on its socioeconomic status. The actual rate is about five times as high. A previous version of this story misquoted Broward County Mayor Beam Furr as saying there are 21 cities in the county. He actually said there are 31. We corrected the spelling of the suspect's name from Nikolaus to Nikolas Cruz when that change was issued by the Broward Sheriff's office. Also, Scott Israel's first name was misspelled as Scoot. A previous version of this story and caption incorrectly said that Margaret Good's victory was by 7 percent and that the district had previously voted for President Trump by 5 percent. Those numbers are actually percentage points. An earlier summary of this report on the homepage mistakenly stated that attorney Michael Cohen said his $130,000 payment was reimbursed by either the Trump campaign or the Trump Organization. In fact, he has said the payment was not reimbursed by either the campaign or the Trump Organization and that it came from his own pocket. In an earlier version of this story, we misstated the source for a figure. The Trump administration, not Congress, added $2 billion to its earlier HUD funding request. A previous caption for the first image incorrectly identified Najla Hussin as Hadiya Haskan. A previous version of this story misidentified chef and cookbook author Todd Richards as Tony Richards. In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question. The blog Paul Vanderveen's Attitude of Reciprocity drew NPR's attention back to this story. In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question. The blog Paul Vanderveen's Attitude of Reciprocity drew NPR's attention back to this story.

Jack Bergeson was 16 when he entered the race. He's now 17. An earlier Web version of this story misspelled Kristine DeLong's first name as Christine. A previous version of this story reversed the couple's ages. In fact, John Banvard is 100, while Gerard "Jerry" Nadeau is 72.

A previous version of this story misidentified the curator of entomology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The curator's name is Brian Brown, not Paul Brown. A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Rep. Adam Schiff as a Republican. Schiff is a Democrat. We incorrectly identify Rod Rosenstein as the deputy director of the FBI. Rosenstein is the deputy attorney general of the U.S. In this report, we say Brad Chapin was among dozens of people testifying in support of London Breed, San Francisco's acting mayor. As Chapin said at a public meeting, he believes the acting or appointed mayor should be a woman of color such as Breed. But his preferred candidate for mayor in the June election is a different city supervisor, Jane Kim.

It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.

In fact, Cassio appears in Othello and Lepidus in Antony and Cleopatra, where his drinking becomes an issue, as well as in Julius Caesar. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we incorrectly say that at least 16 people were shot in addition to the two fatalities. Not all of those who were injured were shot.

The correct title is I'm Still Here. An earlier version of this story misidentified Alan Trammell as Jack Trammell.

The movie was released in 2004 but won its Oscar in 2005. Also, the story said The Dark Knight was passed over for best picture in 2008. The movie came out in 2008, but the nominations and awards show were in 2009. In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses. Previously posted on Jan. 8: We say that Irish voters elected a gay, biracial prime minister. In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election — and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote.

A previous version of this story misspelled James Toback's last name as Torbeck. In this story, we say that two members of Congress, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, have resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, Rep. Trent Franks also resigned, for a total of three. A previous version of this story described Straight, No Chaser as a Clint Eastwood film. Charlotte Zwerin directed the film. Eastwood produced it.

The information came from the American Veterinary Medical Association.

A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published.

---split---41.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/democrats-republicans-house.html---split---Supported by By Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin The message from Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, was urgent and unsparing. In a meeting with Republican lawmakers before they left Washington for the August congressional recess, Mr. McCarthy warned that time was running short: Unless they intensified their campaign efforts and forcefully delivered a coherent message, he said, Republicans would suffer grievous losses in November. Instead of arresting their political decline, House Republicans proved unable at every turn to stay ahead of their troubles — including many of their own making. By Labor Day, Republicans were fatally unprepared for an onslaught of Democratic campaign spending that overwhelmed their candidates from South Florida to Seattle. Party leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House soon turned on one another and against their candidates with growing intensity. Two key groups — the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party’s campaign arm in the House, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a powerful Republican super PAC — plunged into all but open warfare over messaging and money. Democrats, in turn, delivered a message about health care with the repetitive force of a jackhammer. They cracked congressional maps drawn to favor Republicans and seized an array of open seats, while also felling longtime incumbents who had grown complacent. And in the end, President Trump may have delivered the final blow to his party across the diverse and growing metropolitan communities that decided control of the House. In the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Trump cast aside a positive Republican message about economic prosperity in favor of stoking racial panic about immigration — with appeals that veered into overt racism, alienating moderate swing voters and further enraging Democrats. Republicans lost control of the House Tuesday night after eight years in power, with Democrats picking up seats in several suburban districts where the party traditionally did well. But if House Republicans were badly shaken by their defeat, few party leaders were genuinely surprised at the nature of their losses. In interviews with dozens of lawmakers, campaign strategists, activists and donors in both parties, a clear consensus emerged about the arc of the 2018 election. [See the results for governors’ races, the House of Representatives and the Senate.] It was a campaign defined early by Mr. Trump’s divisive persona and hard-right ideology, and by Republican leaders’ unswerving decision to align themselves with Mr. Trump and his overwhelmingly white, rural base rather than politically vulnerable moderates in Congress who hailed from the country’s population centers and represented the political middle. A campaign of retribution against Republicans who did not pledge fealty to Mr. Trump — and to Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s legislative agenda — triggered an exodus of senior legislators that opened the way for a Democratic takeover. Representative Ed Royce of California was not the first Republican to decide he would not run for re-election in 2018. But his announcement, in January, was the warning bell that tolled most ominously for Republican leaders. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce held a quickly diversifying Orange County seat that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 even as it re-elected him. But he told colleagues that he bitterly resented the fruitless, politically damaging health care debate, and announced his retirement in a statement that took the N.R.C.C. by surprise. Within weeks, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, followed suit. Though he had pledged to seek re-election, Mr. Frelinghuysen was incensed over the way Mr. Ryan treated him during the tax overhaul debate — the speaker, Mr. Frelinghuysen told associates, had threatened to eject him from his chairmanship. “He was appropriations chair, and there were lots of people trying to tell him what he could and couldn’t do as appropriations chair,” said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the head of the N.R.C.C. “At that point you’re not as much of a chair.” With their pursuit of an orthodox conservative agenda on health care and taxes, Republican leaders split their party, driving moderate lawmakers into retirement and handing Democrats their most powerful issue of the campaign season — defending popular insurance coverage mandates in the Affordable Care Act. The shift to the left in the House in the 2018 Midterm elections went well beyond the districts Democrats flipped. By last spring, more than 40 House Republicans were leaving the chamber. In the Senate, two Republicans alienated by Mr. Trump, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, also quit in frustration. But the most stunning exit was Mr. Ryan’s. After alienating senior colleagues with legislative arm-twisting and committing his conference to a hard-line agenda that left them gravely vulnerable, Mr. Ryan announced abruptly in April that he was retiring. While he promised to keep raising money for fellow Republicans, Mr. Ryan’s contributions to the party would steadily decline; in the last fund-raising quarter of the campaign, his political committee transferred a paltry $1.4 million to the N.R.C.C., less than some first-time Democratic candidates raised for themselves. Mr. Ryan’s decision left the Republican conference in a baleful mood — and enraged senior White House aides and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “He thought it was selfish,” said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell’s top political adviser, recalling the lawmaker’s reaction to Mr. Ryan’s announcement: “If he wanted to leave, he could leave after the election. He let all his guys hang out to dry.” Mr. Stivers acknowledged that Mr. Ryan’s retirement had choked the party’s fund-raising. Mr. McCarthy and Representative Steve Scalise, the Republican whip, had stepped up to solicit donors as they jockeyed to succeed Mr. Ryan. But Mr. Stivers said there was no substitute for a formidable speaker. Beyond the speaker, Mr. Stivers said he pleaded with colleagues to run again and named several — including Mr. Frelinghuysen and Representatives Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dennis Ross of Florida — as having undermined the party. He sniped at Mr. Ross, who quit the day Mr. Ryan retired: “He saw the cover of Paul retiring, and he slid right under it.” Mr. LoBiondo suggested he could change his mind and run for re-election, provided he could hang on to the chairmanship of a congressional subcommittee he was scheduled to relinquish. Republican leaders assented, but it was not enough. “He got what he said he wanted, and he still retired,” Mr. Stivers said. Without the retirements, the Ohioan told a reporter who joined him as he knocked on doors in his district last Saturday, “We wouldn’t even be talking about the House being in play.” Moderate Republicans in the House also quickly lost patience with what they saw as Mr. Ryan’s deference toward the House Freedom Caucus, a far-right group aligned with Mr. Trump. “Listening to the Freedom Caucus is a problem,” said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican who on Wednesday was clinging to a lead of a few hundred votes in his swing district. Former Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a long-serving Republican who resigned in January to take a private-sector job, said Republicans had “overreached” and handed Democrats a decisive advantage on health care as a political issue. “We probably should have taken on infrastructure in a bipartisan way first and then maybe tax reform next, rather than health care first,” Mr. Tiberi said. The tweet came without warning, on the day of the South Carolina primary. Watching television aboard Air Force One, on a flight back from his summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean despot, Mr. Trump decreed that Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina must be defeated. Mr. Sanford, an idiosyncratic conservative who routinely criticized the president, was in a tough primary battle with Katie Arrington, a state legislator running as a Trump loyalist. Hours after Mr. Trump’s message, Mr. Sanford conceded defeat. If Mr. Sanford suffered in June for his apostasy, Mr. Trump’s party paid another price Tuesday: Ms. Arrington lost the general election in a heavily Republican district to Joe Cunningham, a Democrat. Mr. Trump’s capricious approach to politics was destabilizing for Republicans up and down the ballot, leaving candidates exposed to the president’s whims and grievances and the machinations of White House advisers. Rather than approaching the midterm campaign as a task of holding together a political coalition and steering it to victory, Mr. Trump focused chiefly on rewarding perceived friends — and punishing those who crossed him. He helped drive two senators, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake, into retirement, castigating them in humiliating terms online and driving up their unpopularity with Republicans. In gubernatorial elections, Mr. Trump helped anoint highly divisive nominees in states like Florida and Georgia — where the national G.O.P. had to burn millions staving off defeat — and Kansas, where Mr. Trump’s favored candidate, Kris Kobach, was defeated by a Democrat, Laura Kelly. In other cases, Mr. Trump’s associates lashed out at Republican candidates who failed to prostrate themselves sufficiently. When Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued a supportive statement about a renegotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico, a White House aide sharply rebuked a strategist for Ms. Reynolds’s campaign — because the governor did not praise Mr. Trump by name in her comment. And because of the perceived slight, Mr. Trump’s aides dropped plans for the president to headline a fund-raiser for the governor, instead insisting that the event be held for the Iowa Republican Party. The president’s relative political inexperience also left him open to manipulation by aides and allies with agendas of their own. When a group of lawmakers and White House aides lobbied Mr. Trump to endorse Representative Raul Labrador, a hard-liner running for governor in Idaho, supporters of a competing candidate, Lt. Gov. Brad Little, sprang into action. They assembled footage of Mr. Labrador criticizing Mr. Trump during the 2016 primary, when he was backing Senator Ted Cruz, and steered it to the West Wing. The endorsement was off. The day after Idaho’s primary, Mr. Trump phoned the triumphant Mr. Little and, unaware of the tape’s genesis, asked: “Did you see that video?” And in some cases, Mr. Trump upended his party’s well-laid plans, only to change his mind or lose interest. In Florida, he endorsed Ron DeSantis, a member of Congress who defended him frequently on Fox News, for governor. Yet when Mr. DeSantis broke with the president, over Mr. Trump’s false claim that the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria had been nefariously inflated, the president turned on his handpicked candidate. Mr. DeSantis ultimately won the governorship by a tiny margin, but Mr. Trump criticized him bitterly in the final days of the race. The former congressman, he complained to a friend, “was low-energy.” Mr. DeSantis even earned a nickname: “Little Ronny D.” For members of the House, Mr. Trump was most burdensome mainly because of a mercurial approach to policy that left them unable to map legislation or political messaging in a coherent way. In one instance, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed members to vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act — and then, after a private dinner with Democrats in the middle of June, publicly derided Republicans’ health care legislation as “mean.” On two other occasions — when Congress was set to reauthorize an intelligence-gathering law and again when it was about to pass a sweeping government-funding bill for 2018 — Mr. Trump telephoned a senior aide after watching unfavorable Fox News coverage early in the morning and demanded, without effect, that the bills be taken off the floor. At no point, Republicans said, did Mr. Trump forge a cohesive political bond with Mr. Ryan. Indeed, when Mr. Ryan disagreed last month with Mr. Trump over a proposal to eliminate birthright citizenship, the president shot back with hot anger that echoed his attack on Mr. Sanford: The speaker, he said, should not be discussing “something he knows nothing about!” Mr. Ryan’s allies only rolled their eyes at the all-too-familiar counterattack, predicting that the president would soon also pin the loss of the House on the speaker. Nancy Pelosi did not want to talk about Planned Parenthood. It was a meeting of House Democrats early in 2017, during Republicans’ drive that March to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Pelosi and her political lieutenants laid out their counterattack: Democrats would talk about pre-existing conditions and millions of people losing coverage. And they would talk about an “age tax” — a provision in the Obamacare replacement passed by the House, which would have allowed health insurers to widen the premium gap between younger and older customers. Ms. Pelosi acknowledged it would require restraint from Democrats. In her own San Francisco district, she said, people wanted her to fight the health care battle over funding for Planned Parenthood and Medicaid. “Those things are in our DNA, but they are not in our talking points,” Ms. Pelosi became fond of saying, according to a close associate. [Nancy Pelosi for speaker? Absolutely, President Trump says.] That narrow focus on health care and a few economic issues came to define the Democrats’ midterm campaign. It represented a wholesale rejection of Hillary Clinton’s failed strategy in the 2016 campaign, which focused on Mr. Trump’s fitness for office. Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview that it had been challenging to break the habit of responding with reflexive, public outrage to Mr. Trump’s utterances, especially as those utterances grew increasingly inflammatory. On a campaign swing in his home state the weekend before the election, Mr. Luján said Democratic leaders envisioned a starkly different path to victory, noting that in 2016 a character-driven campaign “didn’t work.” But the temptation persisted. “Every time he would say something or tweet something, it would come back: ‘We need to come right back at him! Define him!’” Mr. Luján recalled. “We would say: Look, we don’t need to talk about him, he’s going to do it himself. We need to continue to have a conversation with the American people about kitchen-table issues.” That judgment was backed up by a vast trove of research, collected by Democratic committees and super PACs through polling and focus groups. House Majority PAC, the caucus’s main super PAC, carried out two intensive research projects, studying right-of-center suburban voters and blue-collar whites who supported Mr. Trump. It concluded that only a message about health care and jobs could win over both groups. In a presentation compiled for the PAC in the summer of 2017 by the Democratic polling firm Normington Petts, party strategists delivered an unambiguous assessment: “The strongest policies for a Democratic candidate are almost entirely economically focused.” And it warned that Mr. Trump was not the “most important villain” — congressional Republicans were. The same presentation, focused on the white working class, noted vaguely: “It’s worth keeping in mind, Democratic leaders will be a significant villain highlighted by the G.O.P.” If the report did not name Ms. Pelosi as a target, the meaning was clear. The determination by party leaders to control Democrats’ message in 2018 — channeling a tidal wave of liberal activism into a winning electoral strategy — extended to primary elections. Ms. Pelosi authorized party groups to meddle aggressively in California’s open-primary system to ensure viable Democratic candidates would emerge. Her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, anointed centrist nominees for the open seats in Tennessee and Arizona. To the occasional consternation of the left, Democrats engaged sparingly on the issue of immigration, condemning Mr. Trump’s harshest policies but never matching him blow for blow. In January, when activists pushed for a government shutdown over immigration, House Democrats concluded after a night of polling in swing districts that such a confrontation risked becoming a fiasco. That strategy of restraint brought Democrats steady gains, as they made inroads into Republican territory in a series of special elections and off-year elections, winning an improbable Senate seat in Alabama late last year, then seizing a solid-red congressional district near Pittsburgh in March. The Democratic victor there, Conor Lamb, ran on a message about health care and economic fairness, and pledged never to support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Mr. Lamb’s upset rattled the Republicans and spurred other moderate Democrats — including a sizable group elected this week — to disavow Ms. Pelosi. On the Republican side, the race stirred new doubts about whether attacks on Ms. Pelosi could save their majority. “What was apparent there,” Mr. Luján said, “is that Republicans did not have a playbook to run against our candidates.” Ms. Pelosi herself was seemingly untroubled: During a fund-raising trip to Pennsylvania early in the summer, she expressed no discomfort with Mr. Lamb. On the contrary, she named him and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left-wing insurgent who won a New York primary in June, as the ideological poles of an emerging Democratic congressional majority. A majority, Ms. Pelosi made clear, that she fully intended to lead. Representative Kevin Yoder saw the news on Twitter one day in late September. A 43-year-old House Republican who represented the well-to-do Kansas City suburbs, Mr. Yoder had to read about how the National Republican Congressional Committee was pulling its advertising from his district because it did not think he could win. Furious, Mr. Yoder telephoned Mr. Stivers and blistered him about being disloyal, reminding the campaign chairman that he had been a vice chairman of the N.R.C.C. and always paid his dues to the committee. Mr. Stivers accepted the tongue-lashing, but Mr. Yoder’s campaign was beyond repair: he lost by 9 percentage points to Sharice Davids on Tuesday. Abandoning Mr. Yoder was a ruthless act of triage, aimed at saving money that could be used to rescue other members. But bitter personal clashes between Republican Party strategists hobbled their efforts to spend money coherently in the last stage of the election. Open animosity erupted between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House super PAC funded heavily by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and the N.R.C.C. The super PAC would ostentatiously leak word of plans to pull funding from vulnerable lawmakers, leaving the committee scrambling in some cases to make up the difference. In some cases, the groups seemed to make decisions more for the purpose of outflanking each other rather than thwarting Democrats. In late September, C.L.F. decided to cut loose two lawmakers, Mike Bishop of Michigan and Mike Coffman of Colorado, calling them unsalvageable. Disagreeing, the N.R.C.C. rushed new money into Mr. Coffman’s district. Soon, both groups would change their assessments: When a poll showed Mr. Coffman losing by 14 percentage points, the N.R.C.C. rescinded much of the money it hastily deployed. And C.L.F., after humiliating Mr. Bishop, returned to spending in his district within weeks, trying to save him after all. Mr. Coffman lost decisively on Tuesday, while Mr. Bishop was losing by nearly four points with nearly all precincts reporting. In the campaign’s finale, Democrats established an overwhelming advantage on television: A coalition of outside-spending groups, coordinated by House Majority PAC, poured an estimated $200 million into advertising, mainly around the tightly-organized themes laid out in the party’s suburban and working-class opinion research. Bolstered by online donations, more than 100 Democratic candidates out-raised their Republican rivals in contested general-election races. And in October, a super PAC financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, ambushed still-complacent Republican lawmakers on the air with massive, late spending, helping to defeat incumbents like Randy Hultgren of Illinois and Steve Russell of Oklahoma. Rather than rallying to face that veritable war machine, Republicans turned on each other. Corry Bliss, the super PAC’s sharp-elbowed chief strategist, badmouthed party strategy around Washington, criticizing the House committee for spending millions on incumbents he saw as hopeless, such as Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who enjoyed infusions of party cash through the end of the election — and lost by 12 percentage points, becoming the first incumbent defeated nationwide on Tuesday. But the N.R.C.C. viewed Mr. Bliss’s group as reckless in its spending and insensitive to the delicate web of egos and relationships in the Republican conference. “Fighting with allies is hard, just look back at World War II,” Mr. Stivers said, likening Mr. Bliss to Bernard Montgomery, the capable but egocentric British general. Even before Mr. Trump began thundering against an “invasion” from Latin America — spurning with finality the moderate swing voters that Republicans desperately needed — his party’s facade of election-year unity was crumbling. Panic mounting, Republican factions began looking out for themselves: Mr. McCarthy, currying favor with the right as he positioned himself to succeed Mr. Ryan, revived a push to fund Mr. Trump’s border wall. On the weekend before the election, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a far-right rival of Mr. McCarthy, began calling colleagues to gauge their interest in supporting him for minority leader in a Democratic-led House. As Mr. Trump swallowed the already-faint Republican economic message with deafening appeals to right-wing nationalism, Republican campaign chiefs began expressing discomfort with his turn toward raw racial politics. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, head of the Republican Senate committee, expressed anxiety to allies that Mr. Trump’s obsession with a migrant caravan could harm his Senate re-election in 2020. Among White House aides, improvisation and favor-trading overrode any semblance of political strategy. Even Vice President Mike Pence, aides noted, appeared less than deliberate in his approach: When conservative media began rippling with interest in John James, a long-shot Senate candidate in Michigan, Mr. Pence phoned the president from the state and urged him to campaign there. The same day, a public poll found Mr. James losing by 17 points to Senator Debbie Stabenow. Johnny DeStefano, counselor to the president, told an associate he used “every ounce of capital” to keep Mr. Trump from visiting Michigan and other states where his party was sure to lose. And in a move that baffled their political peers, both Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy visited Kansas City on the Friday before the election to campaign with Mr. Yoder, among other Republicans — more than a month after the N.R.C.C. concluded Mr. Yoder could not win. Last weekend, the gulf between the two parties — in strategy and message, in political tenacity and internal cohesion — could not have been greater. Meeting with campaign donors in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi declared confidently that the House majority would soon be in Democratic hands. Next up, she said, would be a “huge amount of work to repair the fabric of the country,” according to a person in attendance who paraphrased her comments. Campaigning in Georgia for Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, Mr. Trump delivered a message with all the subtlety of an arsonist’s house fire, accusing Democrats of seeking to inflict “more crime and more caravans” upon the country. And in a fluorescent-lit Republican Party office in Sheboygan, Wis., beneath a bleak sky, Mr. Ryan beamed through an upbeat pep talk to local Republicans about the economy. “Two hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created in America in October alone,” Mr. Ryan said. “This is working!”     A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

---split---42.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-frayed-relationship-trump-sessions/story?id=47886986---split---President Donald Trump counted his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, among his earliest supporters and the first sitting senator to endorse him. On Wednesday, Sessions resigned as attorney general effective immediately at the request of the president. The relationship between Sessions and Trump began to fray last year in the wake of Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation – a cloud that has hung over the Trump administration almost since its inception. Trump even rebuked Sessions publicly, indicating that he would have nominated someone else for attorney general had he known about the recusal and called him a “beleaguered A.G.” on Twitter. Sessions offered to resign at one point -- which Trump rejected -- but later said in the summer of 2017 that he planned to remain attorney general "as long as that is appropriate."   Here is a timeline of the ongoing relationship between Trump and Sessions:    Sessions formally endorsed Trump's candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination days ahead of Super Tuesday, becoming the first sitting senator to do so. Trump's outsider bid continued to build momentum in the weeks leading up to the endorsement as the real estate mogul captured primary and caucus victories in three of the first four contests. “I told Donald Trump, this isn’t a campaign, this is a movement,” Sessions said in a speech in Alabama announcing the endorsement.  Trump appointed Sessions to an official position on his campaign team, naming the Alabama senator the head of his national security advisory council. "I am grateful for the opportunity to recommend and facilitate discussions among exceptional and experienced American military and diplomatic leaders to share insight and advice with Donald Trump, regardless of their political views," Sessions said in a release announcing the appointment.  "To state they met or that a meeting took place is disingenuous and absurd," a senior White House official said in March 2017.  Sessions met with Kislyak on at least two occasions last year. The first came during an event at the Republican National Convention hosted by the Heritage Foundation where the Russian ambassador was among a small group of diplomats with whom the Alabama senator spoke. The second was a meeting in Sessions' Washington, D.C., office that was also attended by staff members.   Though the Department of Justice would later categorize the meetings as routine, given Sessions' responsibilities as a senator, the encounters would play a role in Sessions' recusal as attorney general from all investigations related to Russian interference in the presidential election.  To the displeasure of some Democrats who questioned Sessions' record on civil rights and failed 1986 nomination to serve as a U.S. district court judge, Trump tapped Sessions to serve as his attorney general.    Sessions was questioned by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., about what he would do as attorney general if evidence emerged that members of the Trump campaign communicated with Russia. "Sen. Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities," Sessions said. "I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have -- did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it."  After Sessions' meetings with Kislyak became public, he maintained that he did not answer Franken dishonestly because the discussions came in his capacity as a senator and not as a representative of the campaign. Trump himself later said in a statement that Sessions "could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional."   As pressure built, however, Sessions announced that he would not participate in any ongoing or future inquiries into matters related to the presidential election. "Let me be clear: I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign," Sessions told reporters. "And the idea that I was part of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries to the Russian government are false." Earlier in the day, Trump said he had "total" confidence in Sessions and didn't believe the attorney general should recuse himself. On March 3, Trump reiterated his earlier sentiments about Sessions' intentions and said that the "narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win."  Trump's frustration over his stalled plan to limit travel and immigration from a number of Middle Eastern and African countries boiled over as he unleashed a series of tweets seemingly blaming the Justice Department -- charged with defending the ban in court -- with the revised order's "watering down."  The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.   The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!   ABC News learns that Sessions had recently offered to resign as Trump continued to express frustration with the attorney general's decision to recuse himself from the election-tampering investigation. During the day's White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer, in response to questioning on whether Trump had confidence in Sessions, said, "I have not had that discussion with [President Trump]."    Sessions testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and issued a sweeping denial of any personal involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. "I have never met with, or had any conversation with, any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States," Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee. "Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.” Trump, apparently, was pleased with his performance. Principal deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the president "wasn’t able to watch much of [Sessions' testimony] ... but what he did see, what he heard, he thought that Attorney General Sessions did a very good job, and in particular, was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.”  Trump had a sit-down interview with The New York Times, during which he launched into a blistering rebuke of Sessions and his decision to recuse himself from anything relating to any presidential campaigns, including, most notably, the 2016 campaign. "Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else," Trump said in the interview. When asked whether Sessions gave the president a "heads up" before the recusal, Trump said: "Zero." "So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have — which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, “Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to take you.” It’s extremely unfair, and that’s a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who’s a deputy," Trump said, referring to Rod Rosenstein.  Asked today for his reaction to Trump's comments, Sessions maintained that he will remain at his position "as long as that is appropriate." "We in this Department of Justice will continue every single day to work hard to serve the national interest, and we wholeheartedly join in the priorities of President Trump," he said at a news conference today. "I have the honor of serving as Attorney General, it's something that goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself,” he added. “We love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.”  Trump posted a tweet that included an apparent slight against Sessions, writing: "So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?"  So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?  Sessions did not immediately respond to the tweet.  For the second day in a row, the president aired his frustration with his attorney general and took aim again at his Democratic rival. "Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!" Trump wrote in a tweet.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!  Sessions did not immediately respond to the tweet. Later that day, during a joint news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Trump said that he is "disappointed" with Sessions. Trump said that he wants Sessions "to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before at a very important level." "We will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell," he added. July 26, 2017 -- A meeting at the White House, but without Trump Sessions went to a meeting at the White House that the president did not attend. In a morning tweet Trump slammed his attorney general for not replacing the acting FBI director. "Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!" Trump wrote in two tweets.  Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....   ...big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!  That meeting came shortly after a U.S. official told ABC News that Sessions' chief of staff, Jody Hunt, recently informed White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that Sessions has no plans to resign from his post, despite growing pressure from Trump.   White House press secretary Sarah Sanders later told reporters that Trump has "been very clear" about his feelings on Sessions. "He's obviously disappointed but also wants the attorney general to continue to focus on the things that the attorney general does. He wants him to lead the Department of Justice. He wants to do that strongly. He wants him to focus on things like immigration, leaks and a number of other issues," Sanders said. She went on, "You can be disappointed in someone but still want them to continue to do their job and that's where they are." Nov. 7, 2018 -- Sessions resigns at Trump's request Sessions submitted his resignation letter to Trump after the president asked him to do so. "Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Jusitce every day determined to do my duty and serve my country," Sessions wrote. "I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice."  ....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date. 
---split---46.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-day-2018-americans-set-vote-historic-contest/story?id=58907692---split---President Donald Trump at a press conference where he sparred with some reporters claimed that he "stopped the blue wave" by Democrats through his heavy campaigning for Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. Meanwhile, more than a dozen races across multiple states have yet to be called, including contests in Arizona and Florida for the U.S. Senate and in Georgia for governor. A Senate special election in Mississippi has gone to a runoff. Here's the latest.  Wednesday, 1:42 p.m. EST -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said her fellow House Democrats succeeded in Tuesday's midterm elections because their campaigns were centered on health care. She called it a "great day for America." "The biggest winner yesterday was health care for the American people, for our seniors and for American families," Pelosi said. "We won because from the beginning we focused on health care." Wednesday, 1:20 p.m. EST -- Montana's Senate race is projected to be over, with incumbent Democrat Jon Tester the winner. Tester, who is projected to have won a third term by defeating Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, was one of 10 Democratic incumbents up for re-election in states that Trump won in 2016. Democrats have won six of the seats and Republicans three. The Florida Senate race result has not been projected by ABC News. Wednesday, 1:00 p.m. EST -- Trump at a White House news conference quarreled with some reporters and declared that his campaigning for Republican candidates in the weeks ahead of Tuesday's midterms "stopped the blue wave" of big, expected Democratic wins. "This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about. I don't know if there ever was such a thing, but there could have been if we didn't do the campaigning," the president said, noting that he held 30 rallies for Republicans over the last 60 days. "We saw candidates that I supported achieve tremendous success last night."   Wednesday, 11:37 a.m. EST -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned Democrats against "presidential harassment" as they take the reins in the House of Representatives. McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, recalled his own party's efforts to impeach President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, saying it backfired on them. "The whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting. I remember when we tried it in the late '90s," McConnell said. "We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down, and we under-performed in the next election." House Democrats swept to power after campaigning on the promise of providing a stronger check on the Trump administration. That pledge could initiate bruising legal battles over congressional subpoenas, a stack of demands for documents and testimony from federal agencies -- including the president's tax returns -- and withering investigations into facets of Trump’s personal life, his family business and his government.     Wednesday, 10:36 a.m. EST -- Florida Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson has called for a recount in his race for re-election after unofficial results appear to show him narrowly trailing behind Republican opponent Rick Scott, who is currently the state's governor. "We are proceeding to a recount," Nelson said in a brief statement Wednesday morning, in which he called Scott's lead "razor-thin." A recount of all votes is mandatory in Florida if the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percentage points. But Scott has already declared victory. "This race is over. It's a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career. He is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exists," Scott’s spokesman, Chris Hartline, said in a statement to ABC News.   Wednesday, 10:02 a.m. EST -- Republican Bob Stefanowski has conceded to Democrat Ned Lamont in Connecticut's surprisingly tight gubernatorial race. Stefanowski made his concession during a call-in to a radio show Wednesday morning, which means Lamont will take the seat of the state's outgoing governor, Democrat Dan Malloy. Wednesday, 9:58 a.m. EST -- Democrat Jane Mills will be the next governor of Maine. Maine uses ranked-choice voting, in which voters list candidates in order of preference with their votes shifting to the next choice as other candidates are eliminated, which led to some concerns that the governor's race could drag out for days. But Mills captured a majority in the first round. Wednesday, 9:48 a.m. EST –- Alaska's new governor is Republican Mike Dunleavy. His path to victory became clearer when incumbent Independent Gov. Bill Walker dropped out of the race nearly three weeks ago. Walker threw his support behind Democratic candidate Mark Begich, but Dunleavy picked up the seat for the GOP. Wednesday, 9:22 a.m. EST -- As Democrats prepare to take control of the House, Republicans will decide who will be their minority leader. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for the position. Jordan announced his bid during an interview with The Hill on Wednesday morning, saying he plans to run for the post. An aide subsequently confirmed that to ABC News. Wednesday, 8:45 a.m. EST -- Trump railed against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for months on the campaign trail, warning his supporters of the possibility of her becoming speaker if Democrats won control of the House. But in the wake of exactly that happening in Tuesday's midterm elections, Trump took a different track, tweeting that "in all fairness," that the California Democrat "deserves" to be chosen by her fellow House members as speaker.  In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!      Wednesday, 8 a.m. EST -- Trump continued Wednesday morning to spin the midterm elections as a win for him and his party. "Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!" Trump wrote in a series of tweets Wednesday morning. "To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!"  Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!   To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!    Wednesday, 5:23 a.m. EST -- The Kremlin offered its two cents (or rubles) on the midterm results, saying that even with the change in Congress, it was hard to see how relations between Russia and the U.S. could get worse. "It’s possible to suggest with a high degree of confidence, that of course there is no rosy outlook for normalizing Russian-American relations on the horizon. That does not mean that we will not seek dialogue, we want dialogue,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a daily briefing call Wednesday.   Wednesday, 2:23 a.m. EST -- Democrat Joe Cunningham has defeated Republican Katie Arrington in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District.  Another big upset, Democrat Joe Cunningham has defeated Republican Katie Arrington in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District In this case Trump may have cost Republicans a seat in a very red district https://t.co/o20AVXHifQ Wednesday 2:18 a.m. EST -- Republican Yvette Herrell has defeated Democrat Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, ABC News can project.

Kemp is just above the 50 percent threshold. If his share of the vote falls below 50 percent, Georgia law states that the race would go to a runoff. The Abrams campaign said that they don't expect to concede tonight, and that they believe there are enough votes still outstanding to force a runoff. "We are going to make sure every single vote is counted," Abrams said. Wednesday, 1:25 a.m. EST -- Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher has defeated GOP Rep.

The race between Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally to fill Sen. Jeff Flake's seat is neck-and-neck. Sinema supporter Michelle Rose predicted they'd have a winner by 11 p.m. MST (1 a.m. EST), and Timothy Bradley said he thought it'd be either by 11 p.m. or 12 a.m. Ginny Doherty left a little more wiggle room, telling ABC News she thought it would be closer to 2 a.m. MST.  Im taking predictions on when folks here at the @azdemparty think we’ll know the winner of the #AZSEN race: Ginny Doherty (right) says 2am, Timothy Bradley (center) says 11pm/12am, and Michelle Rose (left) says 11pm pic.twitter.com/MLdjDevfZD  According to officials, those guesses could be way off. Part of the problem is that there are still hundreds of thousands of votes that still need to be tabulated in the state's most populous county, Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes told ABC News tonight that it could take up to a week or more for Maricopa to have their final results.   Sinema and McSally are battling it out for the seat that's being left open by Sen. Jeff Flake's decision not to seek re-election. Preliminary exit poll results suggest that Sinema is getting help by moderate Arizonans, with a 27 point margin that has her up 63 percent to McSally's 36 percent. That appeal, and her perceived independent streak, is what drew Matt Winter to volunteer for Sinema. "In recent history we’ve had John McCain and Jeff Flake and Republicans who have a strong independent streak, and she’s a Democrat with a strong independent streak," Winter told ABC News.  “I volunteered a lot of hours for @kyrstensinema... In recent history we’ve had John McCain and Jeff Flake and Republicans who have a strong independent streak, and she’s a Democrat with a strong independent streak,” Matt Winter, seen here at the Sinema watch party. pic.twitter.com/CtxTBosvs9  Wednesday, 12:18 a.m. EST -- Whatever the results in any given election, the rise in diversity is nothing short of remarkable.

His is Bretta Nelson from the @azhumane and Charlie, one of the #pollingpups at 8 polling places. “To lower blood pressure and for people waiting in long lines, and a unique way to get our puppies adopted.” pic.twitter.com/d1S1e0q4u8  Tuesday, 11:59 a.m. EST -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is confident Democrats will win control of that chamber of Congress in Tuesday's election. When asked at a press conference if she is 100 percent certain her party will become the majority in the House of Representatives, the California Democrat said, "Yes, I am." Tuesday, 11:32 a.m. EST -- Trump retweeted a tweet he had initially posted Monday morning that warned about "illegal voting." The tweet reads, "Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!"   Tuesday, 10:49 a.m. EST -- Humid weather is reportedly causing problems in some election precincts in North Carolina. North Carolina's state elections office said it has received reports that ballots in some precincts in Wake County and other areas cannot be fed through tabulators. But officials said "procedures are in place for these types of events." "Initial reports from county elections offices indicate this issue is caused by high humidity levels. When ballots cannot be ready by tabulators, they are stored securely in 'emergency bins' and will be tabulated as soon as possible," the board said in a statement Tuesday morning. "All ballots will be counted." Tuesday, 10:20 a.m. EST -- Democrats in Florida voted prior to Election Day in slightly higher numbers than the state's Republicans. More than 5.2 million Floridians in total cast ballots either by mail or early voting. Of that number, 2,110,782 were Democrats and 2,088,429 Republicans, according to newly-released data from the Florida Division of Elections. Tuesday, 10:03 a.m. EST -- Newspapers across the United States splashed headlines conveying some of the emotion and tension around this election. Here are a few of them. - The Columbus Dispatch: "It's up to you now" - Connecticut Post: "Midterm mania grips nation" - Chicago Tribune: "A fight for control" - The Des Moines Register: "IT'S DECISION DAY" - The Detroit News: "Battle for Congress spirited until the end" - Houston Chronicle: "DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE" - Los Angeles Times: "Trump's reputation is on the line" - New York Daily News: "YOUR CALL, AMERICA - The Oregonian: "Ready or not, it's finally Election day" - Orlando Sentinel: "FIERCE RACES AWAIT DECISIONS" - The Washington Post: "Uncertainty rules as the midterms reach the wire" Tuesday, 9:46 a.m. EST -- Mark Salter, longtime aide and speechwriter for the late Sen. John McCain, a Republican, urged his Twitter followers to "vote for the Democrat (in most cases)." "That feels weird to write," Salter tweeted. "But the bigger the rebuke of Trump the better for the country. Resist." McCain was one of Trump's most outspoken Republican critics. The Arizona senator died in August at age 85 after a yearlong battle with brain cancer.  Vote For the Democrat (in most cases). That feels weird to write. But the bigger the rebuke of Trump the better for the country. Resist.  Tuesday, 9:17 a.m. EST -- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, made a final appeal to voters. "For the past two years, we've watched this administration attack and undermine our democratic institutions and values. Today, we say enough," Clinton wrote in a series of tweets. "But we won't just vote against radicalism, bigotry, and corruption today. We'll vote for fantastic candidates all over the country—including a historic number of women—who want to raise wages, fight for justice, and help more people get health care," she tweeted. "If they win, they’ll do great things for America. Let's exercise our birthright as Americans today, put those people in office, and continue the hard work of saving our democracy. It'll take all of us. Happy Election Day."  For the past two years, we've watched this administration attack and undermine our democratic institutions and values. Today, we say enough.  Tuesday, 7:43 a.m. EST -- Authorities in some states are warning voters to be vigilant about possible election problems. The New Jersey Department of State urged residents via Twitter to beware of "false information regarding your polling locations."

The New Mexico Democrat is running against Reps. Cheri Bustos of Illinois and David Cicilline of Rhode Island in the caucus’s first contested election for the assistant leader post. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi created the position for James E. Clyburn after Democrats lost the majority in 2010 so he would not find himself pushed out of leadership. The position was an appointed role until the caucus voted in 2016 to make it an elected post. Luján could have an edge in the race after his efforts at the DCCC helped the party reclaim the House majority. But Bustos and Cicilline, co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, were also active in campaigning on behalf of Democratic candidates and are well liked among the caucus. The race will likely be tight. Other contested leadership races have formed for majority whip and Democratic Caucus chair and vice chair. So far no one has announced plans to challenge Pelosi for speaker or Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer for majority leader. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics 5 Surprises from the 2018 Midterm Elections Most midterm elections have dozens of individual House and Senate races that remain unpredictable right up until — and after — the polls close on Election Day. The 2018 cycle was no different, with 22 House and three Senate races still uncalled by 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. But each year, there are a few races that experts thought they had a handle on, only to be flummoxed by the results. Here are five surprise results from Tuesday night: Republican businessman Mike Braun, who painted himself as a political outsider in the GOP primary against two Republican members of Congress, cruised past Sen. Joe Donnelly on Tuesday, outpacing the Democratic incumbent by nearly double digits. Polls had the Senate contest in the Hoosier State neck-and-neck heading into Tuesday. It wasn’t so much that Braun won that was surprising — by Election Day, Indiana was the only Senate race that remained a Tossup, according to ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales — as it was the margin by which he dispatched Donnelly. Braun’s resounding victory dealt an early, crushing blow to Senate Democrats’ already-small hopes of eking out a path to a majority in the upper chamber. Donnelly appeared to have a handle on his re-election bid after winning his primary. But Braun began to pick up momentum in the fall, partly because Republicans were tuning in late, partly because he kicked more of his own money into his campaign, and partly because of the confirmation chaos surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Donnelly, whose tenure will end after just one term in a state Trump won by nearly 20 points, was one of three Democrats to vote for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. But his break with Trump on Kavanaugh may have turned off some GOP and independent voters who’d been willing to stick with him over Braun. This was one of those results that, for many viewers at home, probably came out of left field. Us, too. Former Democratic congressional aide Kendra Horn pulled off the upset of the night for Democrats by defeating Republican Rep. Steve Russell in Oklahoma’s 5th District, which includes Oklahoma City. Trump won Russell’s district by nearly 14 points in 2016, and Russell never told the National Republican Congressional Committee that he was in any trouble in his bid for a third term, a source with knowledge of the conversations told Roll Call. Inside Elections rated the race Solid Republican. Democrats in Washington will be happy to have Horn, who had this to say: 👀  When it became clear on Tuesday that Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton would sail to victory over Virginia GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, many experts, including Roll Call political reporter Simone Pathe, predicted the result would prove a good omen for other Democratic challengers in heavily suburban, GOP-held districts. Those predictions rang true, as Democrats booted suburban Republican incumbents en route to a House majority. You didn't have to look far from Wexton’s 10th District for other examples. Former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger felled hardline conservative Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th District with a strong showing in the Richmond suburbs. And on the coast in Virginia’s 2nd District, U.S. Navy veteran Elaine Luria upset GOP Rep. Scott Taylor, whose campaign was mired in scandal after local news outlets discovered four of his campaign staffers submitted petition sheets with forged signatures in an alleged scheme to put a former Democratic candidate on the ballot to siphon votes away from Luria. Both Luria and Spanberger blew past historical Democratic deficits in party favorability in the districts. Trump carried the 2nd District by 3.4 points and the 7th District by 6.5 points in 2016. One Democratic operative in Virginia described the mood Tuesday night as “absolute ecstasy and insanity.” Inside Elections had rated Spanberger’s race against Brat a Tossup and Luria’s race against Taylor Tilts Republican. With all precincts reporting in Georgia’s 6th District, Democratic activist Lucy McBath appears poised to upset GOP Rep. Karen Handel. McBath led Handel by 2,872 votes as of noon on Wednesday. Inside Elections had rated the race Leans Republican. Handel defeated state lawmaker Jon Ossoff in a special election for the suburban Atlanta district in 2017 that received national attention as a test of Trump's popularity in white suburban areas. Ossoff raised and spent a record $31 million on that election. McBath, just two weeks before the election, had raised $1.2 million. That’s 3 percent of Ossoff’s haul. Handel beat Ossoff by 3.8 percent. A few miles to the east, in Georgia's 7th District, a mirror image of the 6th in terms of demographics and economic status, the outcome is also razor thin, though, for now, it favors Republican incumbent Rob Woodall. With all precincts reporting by noon Wednesday, Woodall, whose race Inside Elections also rated Leans Republican, led by 1,299 votes. Democrat Joe Cunningham’s win in South Carolina’s 1st District is a blow to Republicans who thought they’d hold on to the coastal seat even after South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford lost a GOP primary earlier this year. Tuesday’s upset was another example of the perils Republicans face when they elect hardline conservatives like Katie Arrington over more moderate incumbents in the primaries. Trump carried the Charleston-area seat by 11 points in 2016. Trump openly supported Arrington over Sanford, one of the few members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who has spoken ill of the president. But Sanford may have gotten the last laugh after the president’s hand-picked candidate fell short in the general election in a race Republicans should have won.

Democrat Beto O’Rourke pledged to keep to keep working for Texans in his concession speech on Tuesday after losing his bid for the Senate to Republican Ted Cruz. “What I pledged on behalf of all of us is that in this time of division, with the country as polarized as I can remember it in my life, all of this bitterness, if there is anything we can do to help him in his position of public trust to ensure that Texas helps lead the country in a way that brings us back together around big things we want to achieve…I want to work with him,” he said of his conversation with Cruz in conceding the race. The three-term congressman gave up his House seat to run for the Senate. O’Rourke, 46, has said his next step will not be running for president. “Win or lose, I’m not— I’m not running in, in 2020. I got to tell you, it’s incredibly flattering that anyone would ask me the question or that that’s even up for discussion. But, but since people have asked, the answer’s no,” he told CBS on Sunday. He doubled down on that statement on Election Night. “This team of which we are all members in some way is going to stay together and continue to aspire to do great things. It may be in individual races, in individual communities. It may not have anything to do with politics,” he said to the crowd in El Paso. His dropped an f-bomb in telling supporters how proud he was of them. But, the momentum and national attention he gained in the few months leading up to the election still leaves plenty of room for speculation about what he might do next. O’Rourke raised $70 million — TIME traced where all the donations came from. The Democrat raised so much money that Democrats suggested he give some of it to other candidates and causes before he closed the polling gap between himself and Cruz. A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Cruz with a 5-point edge over O’Rourke. His campaign was focused on liberal messages about health care, immigration and education and progressive members of the House congratulated him on his fight. Could not be more proud of this man, my friend Beto! https://t.co/vyxTFyqNPu   I want to congratulate @BetoORourke on running a great campaign. He raised over $70M without taking a dime from PACs.  Before his election to Congress, O’Rourke worked at several Internet startups in New York and in 1998 started an Internet services company in Texas. In 2005, at age 32, he won his first election that sent him to the city council.

Politics Down to the Wire: 16 House Races, 2 Senate Races Yet to Be Called Two Senate races and 17 House races remain uncalled as of 3:30 p.m. Wednesday on the East Coast. House Democrats have already passed the threshold for a majority by winning 220 seats so far, wresting control of a chamber they haven’t held since 2010. Based on current projections, they could obtain as many as 234 seats — good for a 33-seat majority — though it is more likely they’ll land somewhere around 228 seats for a still-significant 21-seat lead over the Republicans. In the Senate, the GOP not only held the line, but managed to flip Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, each states that President Donald Trump won by double digits in 2016. Here are the outstanding races that will determine the size of the Republicans’ majority in the Senate and the Democrats’ majority in the House: After three full terms (18 years) in the upper chamber, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida conceded just after midnight to Gov. Rick Scott, who is now expected to become Sen.-elect Scott. As of 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, Scott led Nelson by less than 35,000 votes with all precincts reporting. State officials still need to count or verify straggling absentee and provisional ballots. Nelson held a slight edge in the Real Clear Politics polling average heading into the night — though his lead was well within the margin of error, making Florida one of the night’s bigger upsets. GOP Rep. Martha McSally held a narrow lead of less than 15,000 votes over Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema early Wednesday morning as the secretary of state there waits on just 11 more precincts out of 1,489 to report their results. Absentee and provisional ballots will also add to the vote totals in Arizona over the next few days. The race for Mississippi’s junior Senate seat has been called, but there will not be a declared winner until a Nov. 27 runoff election. GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and former Democratic Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy advanced to the runoff after Hyde-Smith failed to reach the 50 percent threshold for an outright victory. Republican Chris McDaniel siphoned off 16.4 percent of the vote from Hyde-Smith. Four incumbent California Republicans are locked in close battles that The Associated Press had not called by Wednesday morning. California’s 10th, 25th, 45th and 48th Districts were all either too close to call or had not received complete reports from their precincts. Reps. Steve Knight and Dana Rohrabacher of the 25th and 48th Districts, respectively, trailed their Democratic challengers early Wednesday. Reps. Jeff Denham and Mimi Walters paced the Democrats in their uncalled races. In Georgia, the adjacent 6th and 7th Districts could both still swing either way. Democratic activist Lucy McBath led Rep. Karen Handel by roughly 2,100 votes with every precinct reporting in a potential upset bid in the 6th District, where Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in the most expensive special election in House history in 2017. In the 7th District, GOP Rep. Rob Woodall led Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux by 3,694 votes with all the precincts in. Utah Rep. Mia Love, who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and is the GOP’s only black woman in the House, trailed by 2.6 percent to Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams with 68 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday in the 4th District. With just absentee and provisional ballots left to count, Democratic challenger Anthony Brindisi led Rep. Claudia Tenney by 1,422 votes in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney, a fierce defender of the president, ran one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable Republican this cycle. Republican incumbents in Maine’s 2nd District (Bruce Poliquin), New Jersey’s 3rd District (Tom MacArthur), New York’s 27th (Chris Collins), Texas’ 23rd (Will Hurd) and Washington’s 3rd District (Jaime Herrera Beutler) each held narrow edges in their respective races at noon on the East Coast, but remained uncalled. Four open seats remain uncalled, with a pickup opportunity for Democrats still on the table. In Washington’s 8th District, rated a Toss-up by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, Democrat Kim Schrier paced Republican Dino Rossi by 5.8 percent with 64 percent of precincts in for a seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Dave Reichert. By 1 p.m., Republicans were still holding on to narrow leads in California’s 39th District, New Mexico’s 2nd District, and North Carolina’s 9th District for open seats previously held by the GOP.

Three States Pass Sweeping Voting Rights Expansions Politics Liz Cheney Announces Run for Republican Conference Chair Freshman Rep. Liz Cheney announced in a letter to her colleagues Wednesday that she is running to chair the House Republican Conference, likely setting up a contested race for what will be the No. 3 position in GOP leadership next year. Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the current conference chairwoman, has not formally announced her plans yet, but she’s expected to run again for the post. Cheney of Wyoming cited the need to “fundamentally overhaul” Republicans’ messaging operation as the reason she is seeking the post. “We need to be able to drive our message across all platforms,” she said. “We need to own the daily news cycles. We need to lead and win the messaging wars. Too often we have found ourselves playing catch up without access to useful information, and we have not been on offense. Constantly playing defense in the battle of communications is a recipe for failure. We need to work as a team to use all our messaging tools to drive our agenda.” North Carolina Rep. Mark Walker, the outgoing chairman of the Republican Study Committee, has been informing colleagues Wednesday morning that he is running for conference vice chair, his spokesman said.

Politics Polis Makes Another Bit of History With Governor Win Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado made history Tuesday when he was elected the nation’s first openly gay governor. The five-term congressman announced in June 11 2017 that he would be retiring from the House to run for governor. He beat Republican Walker Stapelton to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. The win is another milestone in the 43-year-old Polis’ barrier-breaking career. He was the first openly gay man elected to Congress as a non-incumbent. When he and his partner, Marlon Reis, welcomed their first son in 2011, he became the first openly gay parent in Congress. The couple now has two children. Celebrities showered him with support for his historic win. This is incredible! Massive. Congratulations Jared Polis. You did it! https://t.co/dFpOxjHahe   Wow!! Congratulations @jaredpolis of Colorado who just became the first openly gay man to be elected Governor in US History!!! 🌈🌈🌈   Extremely proud of my home State of Colorado for becoming the first state in history to an elect an openly gay Governor! Congrats @jaredpolis! 🏳️🌈 https://t.co/eCdCgCbNLh  Colorado’s 2nd District, which Polis represents and Democrat Joe Neguse won, includes the progressive city of Boulder. But Polis has taken positions other than liberal ones. In Congress, he is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes the most liberal House Democrats, but is also part of the business-oriented New Democrat Coalition, and is an honorary co-chairman of the centrist public policy think tank Third Way. Before coming to Congress, he was a Internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist — he co-founded BlueMountain.com and ProFlowers.com as well as a chain of movie theaters catering to Spanish-speaking audiences. He consistently ranks one of the wealthiest members of Congress.

Politics Despite Losing House, Trump Declares ‘Big Victory’ Even though his party lost control of the House, President Donald Trump declared a “big victory” on Wednesday morning as he focused on Republicans picking up seats in the Senate. The Associated Press projects the chamber will remain in Republican hands, with a Democratic takeover bid blocked after losses in Indiana and North Dakota. But Democrats, fueled by wins in key suburbs, will control the House come November. NBC, ABC News and CNN are projecting Democrats would take control of the chamber even as the outcome in a number of competitive races remains unclear. Trump will hold a news conference at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, his first chance to lay out an agenda for a split government, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in her own tweet. It also will give him a chance to explain how he will work with Democrats. He has yet to broker a major bipartisan deal. The president spent the final days and weeks of the midterm cycle mostly campaigning for GOP Senate and gubernatorial candidates in battleground states. Many of those candidates were victorious, allowing Trump to focus his messaging there and declare himself a GOP savior. [Democrats Take Control of the House With Victories in the Suburbs] Trump began the morning after the much-anticipated midterms by claiming he has gotten “so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals.” He has spent much of his turbulent tenure fueling the country’s tribal divides rather than trying to bridge them, and that was the case during midterm campaigning when he daily called Democrats an “angry mob” that wanted “open borders” and Venezuela-like “socialism.” But, at least for as long as it took to type a tweet, the president struck a different tone on Wednesday, writing: “Now we can all get back to work and get things done!” Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!  The president was pushing his "victory" message hard all Wednesday morning, telling his Twitter followers that "any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election" are merely "FAKE NEWS!"  To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!  Lawmakers and analysts have pointed to an infrastructure package as the piece of legislation on which there is the most bipartisan agreement, and Trump ran in 2016 on passing a bill to rebuild the country’s roads, airports, tunnels bridges and seaports. But a plan he unveiled last year that called for the project to be funded mostly with private funds received scorn from members of both parties and never gained any traction on Capitol Hill. [Republicans Maintain Senate Control] In another tweet, Trump lashed out at Republicans that shied away from his agenda and endorsement. “Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,” he wrote. “Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!” Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!  Trump’s Senate focus and his party’s expansion of its narrow majority means he and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can keep putting conservatives on federal benches. But it’s less clear if split government can produce legislative results. During his final day of campaigning on Monday, Trump was asked how he would handle a Democratic-run House. “We’ll just have to work a little bit differently,” he replied, adding he suspects Democratic lawmakers will want to get a few things done. But House Democrats come January also will have the power to investigate all aspects of Trump’s presidency — and Russia’s 2016 election meddling. Experts say that could quickly put a damper on any bipartisan cooperation.

Politics Bill Nelson, Down Less than 35,000 Votes in Florida, Waiting for Recount Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, who reportedly conceded defeat just after midnight in his re-election bid against GOP Gov. Rick, is now awaiting a recount. “We are proceeding to a recount,” Nelson, the Democrat who is seeking a fourth term, said in a statement Wednesday. Nelson trailed Scott by 34,537 with all of Florida’s precincts reporting by Wednesday morning. More than 8.1 million people cast votes in the race. Florida state law requires a recount if the vote is within half a percentage point. Scott’s lead over Nelson is 0.4 percent with some absentee and provisional ballots still awaiting processing and reporting. Scott’s campaign characterized Nelson’s apparent backtrack on his concession as a desperate move to cling to power. “This race is over,” Scott’s campaign said in a statement. “It’s a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career. He is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exists.” The Associated Press has not called the Florida Senate election for Scott, one of three such races in the chamber along with Montana and Arizona. — Katherine Tully McManus contributed to this report.

Could a Monkey With a Dart Make Better Predictions? — And Other Takeaways From Tuesday’s Election Democrats Score Oklahoma Upset Despite Deep-Red Struggles Here’s All the House Republicans That Voters Sent Home Here’s What Democrats Will Do With Their House Majority Three Reasons House Democrats Likely Won’t Impeach Trump Different Outcomes in the House and Senate — It’s Mostly About Trump Opinion Tuesday Night’s Wave Came With an Undertow for the GOP OPINION — It was the most important midterm election since voters repudiated the unsteady hand of Herbert Hoover in responding to the Great Depression. But unlike 1930 when the Democrats garnered more than 50 House seats and gained effective control of the Senate, the electoral verdict last night was far more equivocal. As anyone who spent last summer at the beach knows, waves come in all sizes. There are gentle waves made for diving seven-year-olds. There are deceptively strong waves that bring with them an undertow. And there are, of course, fierce storm waves that require a response from FEMA. Republicans, from Donald Trump on down, will dismiss last night’s Democratic victories as a wave worthy of a kiddie pool. Already, the early-rising Trump tweeted about “our Big Victory last night.” And, in terms of the Senate where at least three and maybe five Democratic incumbents lost, there is a rationale to the Trumpian hyperbole. Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!  But, in truth, the 2018 midterms appear to have brought with them a lasting Democratic undertow. Looking at the House map from Portland, Maine, to the North Carolina border, only by squinting do you see occasional small splotches of red in places like Long Island. Across the board, Republicans had problems in upmarket, mostly white, congressional districts from Charleston, South Carolina, to Oklahoma City. The new Democratic House majority — and the almost certain return of Nancy Pelosi as speaker — represents a triumph over gerrymandering. Not too long ago political orthodoxy decreed that the Republicans would control the House until after the 2020 Census because the district lines were so artfully drawn by the GOP after the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 elections. Instead, the 2018 House elections were a belated vindication of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 strategy of pitching herself to college-educated suburban Republican women. These women were Clinton’s target audience when she maladroitly described half of Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables” because of their “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic” views. As Trump in the White House fulfills every dire prophecy about his vitriolic fear mongering, affluent suburbs are increasingly becoming part of the permanent Democratic coalition. Republican incumbents who survived 2018 in districts like Ohio-12 (the Columbus suburbs) and Pennsylvania-1 (Philadelphia suburbs) have reason to be fearful of increased Democratic turnout in the presidential year of 2020. Trump also tweeted on Wednesday morning “To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!" As a pundit fearful of the ire of a press critic like Trump, I will happily give him proper credit for losing the House. To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!  The Democrats faced the most daunting Senate map in memory with only nine GOP-held seats on the ballot. Trump responded with fact-free rallies designed to stoke fear of a dwindling caravan of desperate asylum-seekers hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. And it worked in states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri — none of which will be in play in the 2020 presidential election. That said, Democrats still face a moment of reckoning in understanding Trump’s continuing appeal. The president’s support level a bit above the 40 percent mark remains impervious to anything less than nuclear weapons. In fact, the Democrats’ apparent 8- to 9-point edge in the national House vote lines up neatly with Trump’s approval ratings. A national rebellion against Trump might have elected matinee-idol candidates like Beto O’Rourke in the Texas Senate race and Andrew Gillum in Florida’s gubernatorial contest. But demographic change in politics often comes more slowly than the fantasies of hopeful partisans. When the 116th Congress convenes in January, no one should waste too much time analyzing potential legislation. With a House majority, the Democrats have the power to block any further assaults on Obamacare. But it seems fanciful to believe that a divided Congress will produce anything beyond maintaining the basic housekeeping functions of government. Since, unlike the Trump-era Republicans, the Democrats remain a big-tent party, Pelosi in normal times might have problems managing her small House majority. But what matters in the new House will be committee chairmanships and subpoena powers rather than floor votes. And when it comes to organizing the House, even a single-vote margin is sufficient. It is impossible to know whether vigorous investigations of the Trump regime will pay political dividends to the Democrats. But after two years of supine Republican see-no-evil under-sight of the government, the Democrats’ ability to deploy the power to probe will restore Congress’ constitutional role as an independent branch of government. With an enhanced Senate majority, Mitch McConnell will have even greater latitude to reshape the federal judiciary with conservative jurists. In fact, by 2020, any member of the right-wing Federalist Society who is not a federal judge will have ample grounds to be embarrassed for being passed over. At some point, though, those Republicans with a sense of decency and a belief in truth-telling will have to look in the mirror and contemplate the costs of being a Trump congressional enabler. Nothing about the 2018 election should give Republicans the confidence that marching in lockstep with Trump puts them on the right side of history. But for the moment, the Democrats are entitled to a deep sigh of relief. While it was not an Election Night of candy canes and elves prancing on the Capitol lawn, it was good enough to constrain Donald Trump. And that alone made it the most important midterm since 1930.

Politics Republicans Maintain Senate Control Republicans will maintain control of the Senate, but it is still unclear by how narrow a margin. The Associated Press projects the chamber will remain in Republican hands, with a Democratic takeover blocked after losses in Indiana and North Dakota. Democrats always faced daunting odds of winning the Senate. They had 26 seats to defend — 10 of which were in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 — compared to only nine that Republicans had to defend. To win the majority, Democrats would have had to have held all 10 of those seats in Trump states, plus flip two GOP-held seats. Given that Senate math, Trump had an outsize impact on the race for the Senate, barnstorming red states in the final days of the campaign to rally the GOP base. Republican momentum picked up in several states heading into the homestretch. In Indiana, for example, Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly appeared to have the upper hand after the primaries, while GOP nominee Mike Braun’s campaign faltered. But the race tightened this fall, and Braun ultimately defeated Donnelly on Tuesday night. In North Dakota, Democratic Sen. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp struggled to hold on in an increasingly Republican state that backed Trump by 36 points. Voters had previously supported both her and GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, who also came to Washington in 2012, but they had to choose this year. Despite raising millions of dollars late in the race after voting against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Heitkamp remained at a disadvantage in this conservative state. Cramer beat her easily Tuesday night. At the Senate level at least, the heated confirmation fight over Kavanaugh seems to have worked in Republicans’ favor. Republicans said the episode energized their voters, while other strategists noted the late tightening in several of these Senate races was reflective of these states’ Republican lean and GOP voters naturally tuning in late. The fight over Kavanaugh — and the way it nationalized these races — may have also boosted Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn who defeated Phil Bredesen, a popular former governor, to fill the open seat being vacated by Sen. Bob Corker. Not all Republican candidates were able to replicate Trump’s success, though. In West Virginia, for example, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III held on in a state Trump carried by 42 points. He defeated state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. The party divide in the Senate is expected to remain close in part because Republicans could couldn’t put all of Trump’s 2016 states in play. In Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states that held expensive Senate contests in 2016 — GOP contenders struggled to gain momentum. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales moved both races to Solid Democratic before Election Day, and the AP quickly called the races for Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown and Bob Casey.

Where Newly Elected Democrats Stand on Nancy Pelosi Bid to be Speaker Democrats Take Control of the House With Victories in the Suburbs Meet the History-Makers of the 116th Congress Gonzales It’s Not Too Early to Start Looking at the 2020 Senate Map The votes haven’t all been counted in the 2018 Senate elections, but we know the size of the incoming majority will be critical, because the 2020 Senate map offers limited initial takeover opportunities for both parties. Of course, it’s too early to tell what the presidential race will look like, how voters will feel about the economy and direction of the country, and whether they’ll believe more Democrats are needed in Washington. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly), Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 The next class of senators was last elected in 2014 — a great midterm year for Republicans in which they gained nine seats. But the consequence of having a good year in the Senate is having to defend those seats six years later. Republicans will be playing more defense next cycle, defending 22 Senate seats while Democrats will be defending 12 — the opposite dynamic from this cycle. The shape of the presidential race matters, considering 2016 was the first time in the history of popularly elected senators that the Senate outcomes matched the presidential outcomes in every state. If you apply the 2016 presidential results to the 2020 Senate class, the result is no net change. Using the 2012 presidential results as a guide, Democrats would gain two Senate seats by losing Alabama and picking up Colorado, Maine, and Iowa. If the 2008 presidential results applied, Democrats would gain three seats by losing Alabama and taking over Colorado, Iowa, Maine, and North Carolina. Usually the races are more complex and the size of the Senate playing field will also depend on retirements, recruitment and primaries, beyond the presidential map. What immediately stands out about the 2020 Senate landscape is the initial lack of vulnerable Democratic senators. Doug Jones of Alabama is the only Democratic senator representing a state that Donald Trump and Mitt Romney carried in the last two presidential elections. Jones was elected in a December 2017 special election with 50 percent over Roy Moore, who had significant baggage from his past. Jones will start as an underdog in his re-election race. Gary Peters of Michigan is the only other Democratic senator from a state that Trump won in 2016 (albeit with 47.5 percent). But Obama carried Michigan with 54 percent and we saw in 2018 that most of the Democratic senators from states Trump carried narrowly were at limited risk. (And a Democrat won the governorship in Michigan on Tuesday night.) At least two Democratic senators who are up for re-election are eyeing presidential bids: Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. If they chose to give up their seats to focus on the White House, competitive primaries would likely ensue, but Democrats would start as favorites to hold both states. Most of the action on the Democratic side could be in primaries to take on GOP senators. Senate Democrats largely avoided them this cycle because they had savvy incumbents seeking re-election in challenging states. But open opportunities to take on Republicans will be a different story. The crowded and competitive House primaries in 2018 are likely a precursor to what will happen in the Senate next cycle. And those races will likely play host to fights over ideology and the power of the establishment, with potential general election consequences. Democrats could also see a challenge to one of their incumbents. According to a September story in The New York Times, Rep. Seth Moulton is considering a primary challenge to Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The race wouldn’t have general election consequences but would be another sign of anti-establishment fervor within the Democratic Party. Every cycle, there is a least one retirement and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois might be one of them. Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos is close to the senator and would be an obvious successor if a spot in House leadership or a spot as a running mate on a presidential ticket doesn’t conflict. Based on the 2016 presidential results, Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine would be the most vulnerable senators, as the only two Republicans in states that Clinton carried in 2016. There won’t be any shortage of Democrats looking to take on Gardner, particularly after his vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his cycle as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And Democratic donors around the country rallied to raise more than $4 million for a Collins challenger in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings. Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina represent Trump states that Obama carried previously and should be regarded as initially vulnerable as well. Trump and Romney carried Arizona, but uncertainty surrounding the late John McCain’s seat could make it interesting. The seat will be on the ballot in November 2020. Republican retirements are also a possibility. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is 82 years old and faced a competitive primary in 2014, which he won 48 percent to 41 percent. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma is 83 years old, but doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. Competitive primaries are likely if either or both seats open up. Some GOP incumbents could face primary challengers. For Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, that could be Mark Green, who hasn’t even been sworn in yet as the congressman from the 7th District. Alexander won his 2014 primary by 9 points and with just less than 50 percent against six candidates. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has been a vocal Trump critic, which should draw him a primary challenger, even though there isn’t an initial obvious choice. With Nebraska likely to lose a congressional seat before the 2022 elections, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry might attempt a jump to the Senate in 2020 instead of facing off against fellow Reps. Don Bacon or Adrian Smith in a primary down the road. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina looked likely to draw a primary challenge after being critical of Trump during the 2016 campaign. But he’s since done a 180 and was given credit for turning around Kavanaugh’s confirmation. One of the most fascinating races in the country next cycle could be in Kentucky. Sen. Mitch McConnell has proved his skills as majority leader and as a campaigner, but his unfavorable rating has climbed over the years and he seems likely to face another competitive race. While the presidential race will suck up most of the oxygen in the 2020 room, the fight for the Senate should once again be a prime battle.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we. We're taking another look at our software and practices to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.
