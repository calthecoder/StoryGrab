---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-fires-death-toll_us_5be8981fe4b0e84388993aae---split---PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — As wildfires continued to rage on both ends of California, officials released another grim statistic: six more dead in a swath of Northern California wiped out by fire, raising the death toll there to 29. It matched California’s record for deaths in a single fire. Another 228 remain unaccounted for as crews stepped up the search for bodies and missing people. Two people were killed in a wildfire in Southern California. Ten search teams were working in Paradise — a town of 27,000 that was largely incinerated last week — and in surrounding communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Authorities called in a DNA lab and teams of anthropologists to help identify victims. Statewide, 150,000 remained displaced as more than 8,000 fire crews battled wildfires that have scorched 400 square miles, with out-of-state crews continuing to arrive. Whipping winds and tinder-dry conditions threaten more areas through the rest of the week, fire officials warned. “This is truly a tragedy that all Californians can understand and respond to,” Gov. Jerry Brown said at a press briefing. “It’s a time to pull together and work through these tragedies.” Brown, who has declared a state emergency, said California is requesting aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed “poor” forest management for the fires. Brown said federal and state governments must do more forest management but that climate change is the greater source of the problem. “And those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we’re now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years,” he said. Drought and warmer weather attributed to climate change, and the building of homes deeper into forests have led to longer and more destructive wildfire seasons in California. While California officially emerged from a five-year drought last year, much of the northern two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry. Firefighters battling fire with shovels and bulldozers, flame retardant and hoses expected wind gusts up to 40 mph (64 kph) overnight Sunday. In Southern California , firefighters beat back a new round of winds Sunday and the fire’s growth and destruction are believed to have been largely stopped. Malibu celebrities and mobile-home dwellers in nearby mountains were slowly learning whether their homes had been spared or reduced to ash. Two people were killed and the fire had destroyed nearly 180 structures. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby stressed there were numerous hotspots and plenty of fuel that had not yet burned, but at sunset he said there had been huge successes despite “a very challenging day.” Celebrities whose coastal homes were damaged or destroyed in a Southern California wildfire or were forced to flee from the flames expressed sympathy and solidarity with less-famous people hurt worse by the state’s deadly blazes, and gave their gratitude to firefighters who kept them safe. Actor Gerard Butler said on Instagram that his Malibu home was “half-gone,” adding he was “inspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters.” Flames also besieged Thousand Oaks, the Southern California city in mourning over the massacre of 12 people in a shooting rampage at a country music bar Wednesday night. In Northern California, where more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed, the scope of the devastation was beginning to set in even as the blaze raged on. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the county consulted teams of anthropologists because, in some cases, investigators have been able to recover only bones and bone fragments. In some neighborhoods “it’s very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there,” Honea said. Public safety officials toured the Paradise area to begin discussing the recovery process. Much of what makes the city function is gone. “Paradise was literally wiped off the map,” said Tim Aboudara, a representative for International Association of Fire Fighters. He said at least 36 firefighters lost their own homes, most in the Paradise area. “Anytime you’re a firefighter and your town burns down, there’s a lot of feelings and a lot of guilt and a lot of concern about both what happened and what the future looks like,” he said. “Every story that we’ve heard coming through has been that way, like ‘I wish I could have done more, What’s going to happen to our community, Where are my kids going to go to school?’” Others continued the desperate search for friends or relatives, calling evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner’s office. Sol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive. As he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, “I’m also under a dark emotional cloud. Your mother’s somewhere and you don’t know where she’s at. You don’t know if she’s safe.” The 29 dead in Northern California matched the deadliest single fire on record, a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, though a series of wildfires in Northern California wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. Firefighters made progress against the blaze, holding containment at 25 percent on Sunday, but they were bracing for gusty winds predicted into Monday morning that could spark “explosive fire behavior,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Bill Murphy said. Fire officials are bracing for potentially more fires in Southern California’s inland region as high winds and critically dry conditions were expected to persist into next week. “We are really just in the middle of this protracted weather event, this fire siege,” Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said. He said officials were moving resources and preparing for “the next set of fires” as winds are expected to pick up. The chief warned that fire conditions will continue until the parched state sees rain. “We are in this for the long haul,” Pimlott said.
---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/troops-thanksgiving-border-migrants_us_5be947cce4b0769d24cf0fb2---split---The thousands of troops deployed to the southern U.S. border will most likely spend Thanksgiving setting up camp and eating prepackaged meals instead of being able to return to their families. At Base Camp Donna, located between a highway and the border wall separating Texas and Mexico, troops barely have access to electricity, The New York Times reported Saturday. Showers ― which weren’t installed until last week ― can only last a maximum of seven minutes in order to preserve water. Their tents don’t have air conditioning even though the heat is sweltering. The soldiers spend their time trying to make the outpost livable, according to the Times. They play cards and take turns charging their electronic devices. They build barbed wire fences. There’s no mess hall or access to hot food, so instead they eat prepackaged meals. Their deployment orders expire Dec. 15, meaning that they most likely won’t be making it home for Thanksgiving. A caravan of thousands of migrants has spent weeks trekking through Central America toward the U.S.-Mexico border. President Donald Trump, claiming the caravan is filled with terrorists, gang members and drug dealers, decided to deploy additional forces to patrol the border in an attempt to keep people out of the country. Deploying troops to our own border for no national security reason is one of the biggest scandals of this Presidency. These dedicated, skilled, highly trained men and women will likely miss Thanksgiving w family, are near American cities but eating MREs. Let them go home. The Trump administration went ahead with plans to send more than 7,000 troops to patrol the border despite resistance from the Pentagon. The Defense Department rejected demands from the Department of Homeland Security that troops be armed in preparation for contact with migrants last month. Instead, the Pentagon agreed to allow the troops to provide air and logistics support. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis denied that the troop increases represented a political stunt to bolster Republicans ahead of last week’s midterm elections. “The support that we provide to the secretary of Homeland Security is tactical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police,” Mattis told reporters earlier this month. “So we don’t do stunts in this department, thank you.” Yet many argue that the deployment is a waste of time and resources, especially given that the caravan is still weeks away from the border. “When you give a soldier a real mission, you have less of a morale problem, even if it’s Christmas or Thanksgiving,” said Rep. Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.), a veteran of the Iraq war. “But when you send a soldier on a dubious mission, with no military value, over Thanksgiving, it doesn’t help morale at all.” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) criticized the deployment and suggested that the troops be allowed to return home for Thanksgiving. “Every member of Congress, including those that have not yet been sworn in, should be asked if they think that our Troops deployed to the southern border should be allowed to go home for the holidays,” he tweeted Sunday.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/us/at-least-29-confirmed-dead-in-northern-california-wildfire-sheriff-says---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Claudia Cowan reports from Paradise, CA. Six more people have died in connection to the wildfire tearing through Northern California, a sheriff said Sunday evening. The death toll in the northern blaze -- known as the Camp Fire -- rose to 29 as a result of the discoveries, which included five bodies located at homes and one that was found in a vehicle, Butte County Sheriff Cory Honea said. An additional 228 people were unaccounted for, he added. The wildfire now matches the deadliest blaze on record in California history. The Camp Fire, which tore through the town of Paradise, had burned 109,000 acres since it first began on Thursday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. More than 6,400 residences were destroyed in the fire that stands at 25 percent containment, the agency said. At least 31 people have died statewide in wildfires that have burned nearly 400 square miles in Northern and Southern California. Devastating images of Paradise, a town of roughly 27,000 residents, depicted destroyed homes and roads dotted with charred vehicles. Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify victims. Honea said the county consulted anthropologists from California State University at Chico because, in some cases, investigators have been able to recover only bones and bone fragments. Residences were burned down in a mobile home park on Edgewood Lane after the Camp Fire tore through Paradise, California. (AP Photo/Noah Berger) The devastation was so complete in some neighborhoods that "it's very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there," Honea said. By early Sunday afternoon, one of the two black hearses stationed in Paradise had picked up another set of remains. People looking for friends or relatives called evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner's office. Sol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive. Bechtold posted a flyer on social media, pinned it to bulletin boards at shelters and showed her picture around to evacuees, asking if anyone recognized her. He ran across a few of Caddy's neighbors, but they hadn't seen her. As he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, "I'm also under a dark emotional cloud. Your mother's somewhere and you don't know where she's at. You don't know if she's safe." He added: "I've got to stay positive. She's a strong, smart woman." Officials and relatives held out hope that many of those unaccounted for were safe and simply had no cellphones or other ways to contact loved ones. The sheriff's office in the stricken northern county set up a missing-persons call center to help connect people. There were some stories of hope, like that of a 93-year-old World War II veteran was shown kindness and hospitality in the midst of devastation. Businesswoman Tracy Grant was at the Forebay Aquatic Center in Oroville Thursday giving out food to people forced to evacuate their homes when she crossed paths with the veteran, Lee Brundige, who isn't sure whether anything remains of his house in Paradise, The Associated Press reported Sunday. Brundige initially refused the hamburger she offered, saying she should give it to someone who really needed it. She tried to get him to a shelter, but he said he was fine sleeping in his car. The next day, she convinced him to come home with her when the sheriff's office told people to clear out of the parking lot due to worsening air. "He looks at me and kind of grunted, 'No I don't want to take advantage of anyone, you're too kind.' So I said, 'This is my car. You're going to follow that bumper until we stop," she said. GERARD BUTLER SHARES PHOTO OF HIS MALIBU HOME MOSTLY BURNED TO ASHES BY WOOLSEY FIRE After they arrived at Grant's home, her boyfriend Josh Fox helped out by supplying Brundige with new clothes. The elderly veteran has also found a companion in Grant’s dog, Axle, who sits with him in a recliner they share. Brundige lived by himself at his home in Paradise but does not know if his home is still standing. Brundige's son, who lives in Southern California, knows that his father is okay, the outlet reported. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE FANNED BY RETURN OF ‘STRONG’ GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS There were stories of heartbreaking loss as well. One of the Northern California fire's victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise. Ellen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend. Breeding said Walker's husband was at work and called a neighbor to tell his wife to evacuate, but she was on medication and might not have been alert. Authorities confirmed her death late Friday. "A fireman took him to the house to confirm," Breeding said. "This is a devastating thing, and it's happening to so many people." Gov. Jerry Brown said California is requesting aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed "poor" forest management for the fires. Brown told a press briefing that federal and state governments must do more forest management but said that's not the source of the problem. "Managing all the forests in everywhere we can does not stop climate change," Brown said. "And those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we're now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years." Firefighters battling the blaze with shovels and bulldozers, flame retardants and hoses expected wind gusts up to 40 mph overnight Sunday. Officials said they expect the wind to die down by midday Monday, but there was still no rain in sight. Cal Fire spokesman Bill Murphy warned that gusty winds predicted into Monday morning could spark "explosive fire behavior." About 300,000 people statewide were under evacuation orders, most of them in Southern California. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Last week, Trump blamed the fire damage on “gross mismanagement” of forests in California and threatened to cut off federal funding. In response, Young slammed “our so-called president,” saying the real reason wasn’t mismanagement, but climate change. “The extreme weather events and our extended drought is part of it,” Young wrote on his website, adding: “Our temperatures are higher than ever here in our hottest summer on record. That has not helped. DT seems to be the Denier. (I’m holding back and not using the word liar just because it rhymes with denier). It really is time for a reckoning with this unfit leader. Maybe our new Congress can help. I sure hope so.” Some 400 square miles have burned in California, leaving 150,000 people displaced. In the northern part of the state, 29 people were killed in the Camp Fire, which also destroyed more than 6,700 buildings. In the south, fires killed two people and destroyed at least 180 structures in the Malibu area. “Firefighters have never seen anything like this in their lives,” Young wrote. “I have heard that said countless times in the past two days, and I have lost my home before to a California fire, now another.” He added: “Imagine a leader who defies science, saying these solutions shouldn’t be part of his decision-making on our behalf. Imagine a leader who cares more for his own, convenient opinion than he does for the people he leads. Imagine an unfit leader. Now imagine a fit one.” Young purchased the Malibu home of then-girlfriend, and current wife, Daryl Hannah in 2016, Variety reported. It’s not clear if that’s the home he was referring to in his new message. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer has lived and recorded in the area since the 1970s. According to Vulture, the 1978 Agoura-Malibu firestorm burned 25,000 acres and destroyed hundreds of homes, including Young’s. Neil Young on Malibu Beach, 1975 pic.twitter.com/eAQjI6cjY9

Dana Rohrabacher lost to Democrat Harley Rouda in California’s 48th District. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) After 30 years representing the longtime conservative bastion of Orange County, California, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher will not be returning to Congress next year. Democrat Harley Rouda led the 15-term Republican congressman by more than 8,500 votes in the 48th District, 52 percent to 48 percent, when The Associated Press called the race Saturday night. Rohrabacher has not conceded, with a campaign spokesman citing the need to wait until all votes were counted. “There are still more than 300,000 ballots remaining to be tallied in Orange County. We have volunteer observers monitoring the count and will not be issuing a statement until that process is complete,” Rohrabacher spokesman Dale Neugebauer said. The coastal Southern California district was one of seven in the state that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and were top Democratic targets this cycle. And it is emblematic of the types of districts that helped Democrats win their House majority. Rohrabacher had won all but one of his previous races by double digits going back to 1988 — including a 17-point win two years ago — but the Democratic enthusiasm and strong voter distaste for President Donald Trump in the affluent, suburban seat appears to have been a liability for him this year. Besides being a strong defender of the president, Rohrabacher earned a reputation as a top ally of Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Capitol Hill, gaining the nickname “Putin’s favorite congressman.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow California Republican, reportedly said in a 2016 recording that he believed Rohrabacher was being paid by Putin. (He later said it was a joke.) Rouda, a real estate entrepreneur and a former Republican, outraised Rohrabacher — $7.4 million to $2.4 million through Oct. 17, the end of the pre-general reporting period. Rouda positioned himself as a moderate, but he also supports “Medicare for all” legislation and the $15 minimum wage. Democrats have already picked up retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa’s 49th District seat that includes a part of Orange County, where Democrat Mike Levin led Republican Diane Harkey by 9 points as of Sunday. The races in two other districts that touch the county — the 39th and 45th — remain too close to call, with Republicans holding on to slim leads. Bridget Bowman contributed to this report.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/opinion/democrats-midterms-resistance-trump-democracy.html---split---Supported by America finally has a pro-democracy movement — and it did very well at the polls last week. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist The United States finally has the pro-democracy movement that it needs. Last week, ballot initiatives to improve the functioning of democracy fared very well. In Florida — a state divided nearly equally between right and left — more than 64 percent of voters approved restoring the franchise to 1.4 million people with felony convictions. In Colorado, Michigan and Missouri, measures to reduce gerrymandering passed. In Maryland, Michigan and Nevada, measures to simplify voter registration passed. “In red states as well as blue states,” Chiraag Bains of the think tank Demos says, “voters overwhelmingly sent the message: We’re taking our democracy back.” Of course, there is still an enormous amount of work to do. Voting remains more difficult here than in almost any other affluent country. On Election Day, I had to wait in line for 45 minutes, even though I have a job that gives me the luxury of voting in the middle of the day. And this country also suffers, unfortunately, from an anti-democracy movement: Leaders of the Republican Party — out of a fear of the popular will — keep trying to make voting harder. They have closed polling places, reduced voting hours and introduced bureaucratic hurdles. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Amid last week’s mostly good news, Arkansas and North Carolina passed new voter-identification measures that are clearly intended to hold down African-American turnout. Most outrageously, top Republicans, including President Trump and Senator Marco Rubio, are arguing that Florida should not carefully count all of the votes from this year’s election. Over all, though, the election was an excellent one for American democracy. The battle has now been fully joined: Progressive activists have come to understand the importance of promoting and protecting democracy. Most citizens — across the political left, center and right — agree. Before the midterms, the leaders of Indivisible, the big progressive grass-roots group, conducted a national survey of its members — people who had marched, knocked on doors or otherwise gotten politically involved over the past two years. The survey included a list of issues, and asked which should be the Democrats’ top priorities after the midterms. It included health care, gun safety, the environment, civil rights, reproductive rights, taxes, the courts, education and criminal justice reform. And there was a landslide winner. But it wasn’t any of those issues, important as they are. The winning issue was democracy. Some 69 percent of respondents named it in their top three priorities. Health care finished a distant second, at 48 percent. Then came the environment (43 percent), judicial nominations (32 percent) and civil rights (29 percent). “It comes from this general concern about democratic institutions not being reflective of the will of the people,” Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, told me. Leah Greenberg, also a co-founder, says, “We have to unrig the rules.” Best of all, the success of the recent ballot initiatives shows that these attitudes exist among many centrists and conservatives, too. True, some pro-democracy changes are not realistic anytime soon. Trump and this Senate won’t enact a new federal Voting Rights Act, nor will they grant the full rights of citizenship to the residents of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. But many other changes are feasible. At the state level, a wave of new governors and legislators will soon take office, and they can accomplish a lot. States that don’t have automatic voter registration should adopt it. (Hey, Governor Andrew Cuomo: Isn’t New York supposed to be a progressive leader?) States that have not yet created nonpartisan offices to draw congressional districts should follow the examples of Colorado, Michigan and Missouri. If governors and legislators won’t act, citizen activists should, using ballot initiatives. Most of these measures will pass, in both blue states and red. Arizona, Florida and Ohio, among others, could hold initiatives to establish automatic registration, Stephen Wolf of Daily Kos has noted. Still other states could follow Florida’s lead and re-enfranchise people with felony convictions. This is also a moment to think ambitiously about a pro-democracy agenda. Any Democrat considering a 2020 run for president should be working on a democracy plan, much as any Democrat running in 2008 had a health care plan. My own wish list includes universal voting by mail, which some parts of the West already use — and which lifts turnout much more than automatic voter registration alone. I would also like to see more places lower the voting age to 16 for local elections, as a few Maryland cities have. If you’re old enough to operate a lethal two-ton vehicle, you’re old enough to have a say in your community’s future. More democratic participation won’t solve all of the country’s problems. But it will solve some of them. The United States has low voter turnout for a reason: Our system — with workday elections, long voting lines and cumbersome registration rules — is designed to discourage mass participation. That same system once barred women, African-Americans and 18-year-olds, among others, from voting. The system has changed before, and it can change again. It is already starting to.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/democrats-midterms-progressives.html---split---Supported by Learning the right lessons from the 2018 midterms is key for the party as it looks ahead to the 2020 elections. By Steve Phillips Mr. Phillips is the author of “Brown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority.” Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams, progressive African-American Democratic candidates, may not have won their races for governor in Florida and Georgia (both are still too close to call). But the strategy they followed is still the best strategy for Democrats to win: inspiring, mobilizing and turning out voters of color and progressive whites. I’ve argued for this strategy for years. In my 2016 book, I analyzed Barack Obama’s victories in the context of the country’s changing demographics. The implications of the Gillum and Abrams races are profound (to be clear, I did fund-raising for the efforts to elect both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum, just as I did for Mr. Obama in 2008), and learning the right lessons from 2018 is key for Democrats as they look ahead to the 2020 elections. Over the past 20 years, the best-performing Democratic candidates in statewide elections in Florida and Georgia have been Mr. Obama, Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams. (Hillary Clinton in 2016 was actually Florida’s highest Democratic vote-getter ever.) This year, Ms. Abrams dramatically increased Democratic turnout, garnering more votes — 1.9 million — than any other Democrat running for any office in the history of Georgia (and that includes Jimmy Carter, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton). Conventional wisdom dictated that both Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams did not give Democrats their best chance; more traditional, moderate white candidates were seen as the most competitive. In this view, moderate candidates can better appeal to and win over “swing” white voters. Midterm results laid bare the fallacy of that view. In Missouri, Claire McCaskill, the incumbent Democratic senator, lost to Josh Hawley by six percentage points, 45.5 percent to 51.5 percent. Senator McCaskill campaigned by highlighting her moderate credentials and ran a radio ad distancing herself from her party: “Claire’s not one of those crazy Democrats,” a narrator said. “She works right in the middle and finds compromise.” In Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, the state’s former governor, lost his bid for the Senate by over 10 points despite his attempt to peel off Trump supporters by coming out in support of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Or go back to the 2014 Georgia election results. The strategy of wooing supposedly moderate whites was put to the ultimate test when Democrats fielded nominees from two of the most prominent Democratic families in the history of Georgia — the Carters and the Nunns. Jimmy Carter’s grandson Jason Carter ran for governor, and former Senator Sam Nunn’s daughter Michelle Nunn ran for Senate. Together their campaigns spent more than $20 million, pouring enormous sums into television advertising seeking to persuade moderate whites to back their bids. They each received about 45 percent of the vote. To date, Ms. Abrams has secured 49 percent of the vote and may yet pull off a victory, pending final vote tallies. Or look at last year’s special election in Georgia’s Sixth District. Historic sums of money were raised and spent, and the Democrat, Jon Ossoff, still lost to Karen Handel. This year, riding the swell of turnout inspired and organized by Ms. Abrams, the Democrat Lucy McBath flipped that seat. Clearly success required a different strategy. Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum embraced the Obama playbook for winning elections: It starts with emphasizing mobilization over persuasion. Ms. Abrams’s campaign defied conventional wisdom by spending early and big on a vast mobilization effort that involved calling, texting and knocking on the doors of nearly 600,000 infrequent Georgia voters a full year before the election. Mr. Gillum took a similar approach and was buoyed by the backing of organizations such as New Florida Majority, which hired community-based canvassers to knock on tens of thousands of their neighbors’ doors to identify and mobilize Gillum supporters long before the rest of the country caught on to his candidacy. These campaigns laid the groundwork for future Democratic success, because the thousands of volunteers, operatives and new voters will pay dividends for the 2020 Democratic nominee. Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams did exactly what Mr. Obama did: They inspired people across the racial spectrum to participate and vote, and they did it by being unapologetically progressive. They did not shy away from championing Medicaid expansion, pursuing criminal justice reform and promoting gun control policies. Does this strategy require a candidate of color? No, but it does call for candidates who can inspire voters of color. Beto O’Rourke in Texas is an excellent example, and his inspiring and well-organized campaign brought him closer to winning statewide than any Democrat has come in Texas in years. And nationally, the Democrats reclaimed a majority in the House by winning in nearly a dozen districts with large populations of voters of color. Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum were also not afraid to tackle the not-so-silent racist “dog whistles” emanating from their opponents and the president. Ms. Abrams refused to shirk from condemnation of racism and condemned the ways in which honoring racist imagery like the Confederate monument at Georgia’s Stone Mountain monument — called out by name in Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech — undermines democracy and distances entire groups from being part of the body politic. Mr. Gillum offered one of the greatest lines in the history of American politics when he offered, about his opponent, Ron DeSantis, during a debate: “I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist.” Notably, this approach of tackling racism head-on is also the best way to woo many white voters. According to the exit polls, both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum received more support from whites in their states than either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton did. White people — all people — want to believe in something. Challenging them to reject racism and embrace their highest and best ideals is the most effective way to secure their support. Yes, the strategy of mobilizing voters of color and progressive whites is limited by the demographic composition of particular states. But what Mr. Obama showed twice is that it works in enough places to win the White House. And that is exactly the next electoral challenge. Democrats can go the old route that has consistently failed to come close to winning and demoralized supporters down the line, or they can do the math and follow the example of Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum and Mr. Obama before them. Invest in the infrastructure and staffing to engage and mobilize voters. Stand as tall, strongly and proudly for the nation’s multiracial rainbow as Mr. Trump stands against it. And mobilize and call forth a new American majority in a country that gets browner by the hour and will be even more diverse by November 2020.

President Trump was right to tweet an outraged response Saturday to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron after Macron said in a radio interview that France and Europe need an army to defend against America, Russia and China. I went into the Marine Corps in 1942 and signed up for a four-year hitch. I was 17-years-old when I went in, and stationed in Jacksonville, Florida – a long way from Elmira, New York. As President Trump attended the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of the first World War, his host, French President Macron launched an extraordinarily direct political attack. To impeach or not to impeach? That is the choice before Nancy Pelosi as she strategizes over how best to position Democrats for 2020 and as she fends off yet another challenge to her leadership in the House. Trump suffered a loss but not a repudiation - meaning this is actually a time of promise and possibility because it’s a time of movement. Counting every vote, properly and fairly, is the most basic tenet of democracy. Get ready for Hillary Clinton 4.0. Reinventing herself as a liberal firebrand, Mrs. Clinton will easily capture the 2020 nomination. Or will his drift left to vanquish challenger Cynthia Nixon harm his chances? We hear nothing now about #BelieveAllWomen, because its political value is spent. Unfortunately, I am not the only veteran who has been denied the care they earned.

How many times have you heard someone say to a person who is angry and agitated, “Hey, take a few deep breaths and chill.” One hundred years ago this Sunday, an armistice ended the fighting in the Meuse-Argonne region of France. To say it was welcome would be a vast understatement: Between September 26 and November 11, 1918, more than a million American soldiers had been engaged in fierce battle against the depleted but determined forces of imperial Germany. With more than 26,000 dead and more than 95,000 wounded, the battle stands as the bloodiest single military engagement in U.S. history.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-female-lawmakers-gender-equality_us_5be5eba1e4b0769d24cd0dbd---split---An incredibly diverse group of women will show up for work in Congress next year. Native American women, Muslim women, African-American women, mothers and child-free women, young and old women all won elections this week. But in one regard these women will be remarkably homogeneous: They’re mostly Democrats. There are still a few contests that haven’t been decided, but as of this writing, a record 123 women will be heading to Congress for the next term. Only 19 of them are Republicans ― down from 23. In other words, while the Democratic Party in Congress edges closer to something like gender parity ― nearly 40 percent of the House Democratic caucus will be female ― the GOP is bleeding female politicians. Republicans have shown diminishing interest in putting up women in elections. During the 2018 cycle, female Republican candidates had a hard time getting funding, Jennifer Pierotti Lim, co-founder of Republican Women for Progress, told HuffPost recently. “The RNC has long purported to support getting more women into office, but they don’t do anything,” said Lim, who added that a lot of the GOP women running in primaries this year couldn’t get enough funding from the party. “So nobody takes them seriously.” What this means going forward is that women’s electoral successes are linked to the vagaries of the political environment, said Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia. “Certainly, it is the year of the woman, but with an asterisk,” she said. It’s not surprising, of course, that the party of a president notorious for misogyny and accused of sexual misconduct is edging ever closer toward pure patriarchy. But it’s important to clarify that the Republican Party’s affinity for electing men ― and its male perspective ― is a problem for everyone. The GOP’s aversion to women is holding back what looks like real movement toward gender equality in Congress, i.e., a truly representative body that looks like the rest of the U.S., where slightly more than half the population is female. “We’re not gonna get to 50 percent women if only one party gets to 50 percent women,” said Deborah Walsh, the director of Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics. “Work has to get done on the Republican side to get to the point where we see parity.” Female candidates win at the same rates as their male peers, Walsh said. This holds for both parties. On Tuesday, for example, Tennessee elected its first female senator, Republican Marsha Blackburn, a Trump-supporting conservative woman. The effects of this lopsided gender configuration extend beyond the demographics of the legislature. If women are mostly confined to one party, then stereotypes about women are going to be harder to dislodge and the concerns of the women of this country will increasingly be viewed through a partisan lens. The Me Too movement started out largely apolitical when confined to Hollywood moguls ― but then turned rabidly partisan when politicians started getting accused of misconduct. And the way the two parties handled accusations had a lot to do with their gender composition. Democrats in the Senate, largely led by Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), ousted their colleague Al Franken over sexual misconduct. Gillibrand received pushback, to be sure, but her colleagues ultimately followed her lead. Republicans in Congress, dominated by men, haven’t been as willing to clean house. Indeed, they overwhelmingly rushed to defend and push through the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, even as he was facing credible accusations of misconduct. Notably, the only Republican to defect on Kavanaugh was one of the party’s few female senators. Would a Republican Party with more female politicians have behaved similarly? There’s a perception that women are a minority voting bloc with a common interest. But as a group, they’re actually just like men: Some lean conservative, some don’t. That’s a lesson that should have been made extra-clear after white women helped propel Trump to the White House in 2016, and also broke for the GOP on Tuesday. By confining women and their interests to one party, there is a risk of turning certain issues ― like health care, or paid leave, or equal pay ― into partisan concerns. Consequently, women become excluded from crucial conversations: Remember that all-male Republican group convened to decide the fate of reproductive health care early on in the Trump administration? “It further politicizes the kinds of issues that matter to the women who were elected,” said Lawless. “Those issues that disproportionately affect women are now going to be seen even more as Democratic issues.” Yet there’s wider consensus nationwide on many of these matters. For example, an overwhelming majority of Americans support paid leave. Equal representation for women is important to our whole democracy ― not just the Democratic Party.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/what-are-5-200-troops-going-do-border-maybe-not-n934501---split---WASHINGTON — In anticipation of the Honduran migrant caravan crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump ordered 5,200 troops to the border. But now that the troops have been deployed, they may find themselves with very little to do, according to officials familiar with the plans. Troops are not allowed to apprehend immigrants like border agents do. For the most part, they are laying barbed wire barriers and erecting tent facilities for themselves and the Border Patrol. The only armed troops are military police, who are there to protect the encampments where troops are staying. While some troops will wear body armor, they will do so only for self-defense and will not directly interact with immigrants. The operation, renamed this week from "Operation Faithful Patriot" to "border support," will cost at minimum $200 million, estimates say, and the number of troops involved could rise to as many as 15,000, according to figures Trump has floated. Trump has said the troops are defending the border and called them a "human wall." His critics have called it a campaign stunt designed to drive fear of immigration ahead of the mid-term elections. Military officials are using it as a readiness exercise, hoping troops will at least get training at the border that they can use on future deployments. One U.S. Customs & Border Protection official said border agents are happy to have support for jobs like rolling out barbed-wire. "I think they are happy that the military will be doing the work that agents don't want to do," said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Most of the troops are in Texas, including in the Rio Grande Valley, the southern border's most heavily trafficked section. Others are spread along other sectors in California and Arizona. Some sectors, such as El Paso, have said they don't know if or when they will have troops coming to support them. "Our service members are performing duties along the Southwest Border in support of Customs & Border Protection and will continue to do so until otherwise directed by our senior leaders, to include the commander-in-chief," said Mike Kucharek, chief of integrated communications for U.S. Northern Command, which is overseeing the mission. The latest figures on the migrant caravan predict somewhere between 3,500 to 5,000 Honduran migrants have made it to Mexico City and plan to travel north to the United States sometime over the next month. It is unlikely all of the caravan would cross the southern border in one day, but even if they did, the number is not expected to overwhelm border agents. In September, the latest month for which data is available, border agents arrested or denied entry to 1,685 undocumented immigrants per day on average. CBP is the largest federal law enforcement agency in the United States, with more than 40,000 sworn officers and more than 60,000 total employees.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.pewhispanic.org/2018/10/25/more-latinos-have-serious-concerns-about-their-place-in-america-under-trump/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Hispanic Trends About half say situation for U.S. Hispanics has worsened over the past year; majority worry that they or someone they know could be deported By Mark Hugo Lopez, Ana Gonzalez-Barrera and Jens Manuel Krogstad Half of Latinos say their situation in the U.S. has worsened over the past year, up from 32% in the weeks after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election and the highest level since the Great Recession.1 In addition, more say they have serious concerns about their place in American society now (49%) than in 2017 (41%). And a majority (55%) say they are worried that they, a family member or close friend could be deported. Many blame the current administration for what they see as the worsening situation of Hispanics, the nation’s largest minority group. Two-thirds (67%) say the administration’s policies have been harmful to Hispanics – a much higher share than during the administration of either Democrat Barack Obama (15% in 2010) or Republican George W. Bush (41% in 2007).2 Overall, six-in-ten Hispanics (62%) say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today, up since 2017 and the highest level since the Great Recession a decade ago, when 70% of Hispanics said they were dissatisfied with the nation’s direction. And yet, attitudes among Latinos are not monolithic. Slightly less than a quarter of Latinos (23%) identify as Republican or describe themselves as leaning Republican. Among this group, six-in-ten (59%) approve of President Trump’s job performance, compared with just 8% of Latino Democrats who say the same.3 In addition, half as many Latino Republicans as Latino Democrats (28% vs. 57%) say the Hispanic population’s situation has grown worse over the past year. Notably, partisan differences do not extend to voting. In each partisan camp, about six-in-ten (59%) registered voters say they are more enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterms than in the last congressional elections. This year, more than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote, up from 25 million in 2014. Half of Hispanic adults (49%) are foreign born, and as a group they have stronger concern than those born in the U.S. Immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics to say they have serious concerns about their place in U.S. society (57% vs. 42%), and they worry a lot or some about deportation (66% vs. 43%). Foreign-born Hispanics are also more pronounced in their criticism of the Trump administration: 71% say White House policies have been harmful to Hispanics as a group, compared with 63% of U.S.-born Hispanics who say the same. These are among the key findings from a new nationally representative, bilingual telephone survey of 1,501 Hispanic adults, conducted by cellular and landline telephone from July 26 to Sept. 9, 2018, by SSRS for Pew Research Center. The survey’s margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence interval. Latinos’ downbeat assessments extend to their own economic situations. Asked about their personal finances, only a third rate their situation as excellent or good, down from 40% who said the same in 2015. And when it comes to the next generation, the share who say their children will be better off financially than they are has declined from 72% to 54% over the same three-year period. These signs of waning economic confidence contrast with government data showing Latino unemployment at historic lows and Latino household incomes increasing faster than for other groups. Beyond economic considerations, a majority (54%) of Hispanics say it has become more difficult in recent years to be Hispanic in the U.S. This feeling is even more pervasive among foreign-born Hispanics (64%) than among the U.S. born (44%). And nearly four-in-ten Hispanics say they have experienced at least one of four offensive incidents in the past year because of their Hispanic background, although about as many note that someone has expressed support for them because they are Hispanic. For the 38% of Hispanics who say they have experienced an incident, these comprise: experiencing discrimination or unfair treatment because of their Hispanic background, being criticized for speaking Spanish in public, being told to go back to their home country, or being called offensive names. Immigrant Hispanics are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics to report they have experienced most of these incidents. Individual experiences of discrimination notwithstanding, the survey finds Hispanics are overwhelmingly proud of their heritage (97%). Strong majorities also express pride in being American (84%). Asked if they could do it again today, 70% of Hispanics born in another country or in Puerto Rico said that they would migrate, or leave Puerto Rico, for the U.S. They also continue to see the U.S. as a better place to get ahead (85%) and a better place to raise children (73%) than their countries of origin or Puerto Rico. The nation’s Latino population stands at nearly 59 million and is one of the youngest and fastest-growing groups in the U.S. Its composition is also changing as the foreign-born share has fallen and U.S. births now drive growth. Overall about one-third of all Latinos are foreign born. Among the about 19 million Latino immigrants, some 8 million are unauthorized immigrants.  The terms Hispanic and Latino are used interchangeably in this report. U.S. born refers to persons born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, and those born elsewhere to at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen. Foreign born refers to persons born outside of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories to parents who were not U.S. citizens. The following terms are used to describe immigrants and their status in the U.S. In some cases, they differ from official government definitions because of limitations in the available survey data. First generation refers to foreign-born people. The terms “foreign born,” “first generation” and “immigrant” are used interchangeably in this report. Second generation refers to people born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, with at least one first-generation, or immigrant, parent. Third and higher generation refers to people born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories with both parents born in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories. Language dominance is a composite measure based on self-described assessments of speaking and reading abilities. Spanish-dominant people are more proficient in Spanish than in English (i.e., they speak and read Spanish “very well” or “pretty well” but rate their English-speaking and reading ability lower). Bilingual refers to people who are proficient in both English and Spanish. English-dominant people are more proficient in English than in Spanish. Hispanic Republicans and Hispanic Democrats refers to those who identify as or lean toward one of the two major political parties. Eligible voters or the voting eligible population are persons ages 18 and older who are U.S. citizens.

Dana Rohrabacher has lost the congressional seat he held for 30 years, a stunning defeat for Republicans in what had long been the deepest red parts of the county. Real estate entrepreneur Harley Rouda's win comes after two decades of erosion in the Republican base and at a time when Rohrabacher’s friendliness to people with links to Russia has become more controversial. Rohrabacher, 71, has represented the region since 1988, when he left a job in the Reagan White House to run for Congress. Rouda, 56, a former Republican, said he left the party as it became stridently partisan in the mid-1990s. An eager nation waits breathlessly as California counts its election ballots. Alarmed by the troubled history of a gunman who killed 12 people in Thousand Oaks this week, state Assemblyman Phil Ting said Friday he will reintroduce a bill that would make it easier to confiscate firearms from people deemed a public danger. Ian David Long, who police say is behind the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill on Wednesday night, had been evaluated in April by mental health specialists who were called out by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department after a disturbance call. Law enforcement officials determined Long did not qualify for an involuntary psychiatric hold and did not pursue a court order allowed by state law that would temporarily remove guns from a person considered dangerous. California Assembly Republicans on Thursday elected a new leader, Assemblywoman Marie Waldron of Escondido, who said the minority party needs to take action to end its decline. Waldron takes over as Assembly Republican leader from Assemblyman Brian Dahle of Bieber, who is stepping down from the role to run for a state Senate seat being vacated by incumbent Ted Gaines, who was elected to the state Board of Equalization on Tuesday. The share of registered Republican voters in California has declined steadily from 35.5% in 1998 to 24% this year, and the party appears to have lost seats in the Legislature after Tuesday’s election, although votes are still being counted. California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra on Thursday hailed a federal court’s decision to block the ending of a program that provides temporary protections to immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Becerra said the ruling would provide relief to thousands of young so-called Dreamers across the country, calling it an unexpected and “tremendous victory” for believers in the American dream and the rule of law. But he said the legal battle would continue should the case go to the U.S. Supreme Court. “This fight is personal to so many communities in California,” he said. “As the son of immigrants, this fight is personal to me too.” “Orange is the new blue,” gubernatorial candidate tells the crowd at the Katie Porter Rally and gets a big cheer c pic.twitter.com/jHD7fwPOIM Lots of cheers as John Cox’s bus rolls up to Santa Clarita. pic.twitter.com/Szvawai315 Once enemies, now allies: @Click_CA & @luis__vizcaino at the rally for congressional candidate Katie Porter in Irvine.

Two years ago, Luis did press for Loretta Sanchez & Nathan for Kamala Harris in the 2016 Senate race. pic.twitter.com/RtWOATqJm7 California voters have a lot of choices in front of them come election day — perhaps none larger than whether they see the state’s political choices as part of a national referendum on President Trump. On this week’s podcast, we take a close look at the candidates in the races for governor and U.S. Senate. We also dive deep into the congressional battleground of Orange County — home to four closely watched contests. And we examine the potential impact if the polls are right and two major California ballot measures are rejected. In his last campaign as governor, Jerry Brown rallied Friday against Proposition 6, tying the initiative to supporters of President Trump and warning it will hinder California’s efforts to repair roads and bridges. “Prop. 6 is a scheme and a scam put on the ballot by some partisans,” Brown said at a campaign rally in Palo Alto. “Actually they are acolytes of Donald Trump. They don't have the best interest of California in mind." The measure, which would repeal an increase in the state’s gas tax and vehicle fees, was qualified for Tuesday’s ballot by a committee funded by the GOP leaders including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox. Republican leaders hope the measure will drive conservative voters to the polls on Tuesday to boost the chances of their party’s candidates. A man accused of mailing bombs to top Democratic officials and public figures researched a state legislator from Southern California as a potential target, according to the lawmaker’s office. A spokesman for Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) said the FBI notified the lawmaker of his connection with the case on Tuesday. Lara, a candidate for California insurance commissioner, has not received any suspicious packages. “The FBI notified Sen. Lara that the suspect researched him as a possible target,” said Michael Soller, Lara’s spokesman. “He had a conversation with the FBI and the investigation is ongoing.” Proposals to address the state’s housing-affordability problems fill the November statewide ballot. On this episode of Gimme Shelter: The California Housing Crisis Podcast, we talk about all of them. Gubernatorial candidates Gavin Newsom and John Cox have made housing affordability central to their platforms, and we detail what they both want to do. And we break down the four housing ballot measures voters will decide on: Copyright © 2018, Los Angeles Times

President Trump signs proclamation restricting asylum-seekers at the border; reaction from former immigration judge Andrew Arthur. Abdoulaye Camara's journey to the United States from his home in Mauritania was a dangerous and arduous one, and it underscores that the stream of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border now includes many who come from the other side of the world.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-cohen-michelle-obama-donald-trump_us_5be90097e4b0e843889965e6---split---Michael Cohen, the former personal attorney to President Donald Trump who has since turned on his longtime employer, fired off a tweet on Sunday night praising Michelle Obama. Cohen didn’t mention Trump by name, but he certainly was referring to him with his tweet about the former first lady’s “20/20” interview: Watching Becoming @MichelleObama on #abc2020 and pray that her words bring back unity to our country. Over the summer, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple counts including tax fraud, making a false statement and interfering in the 2016 presidential election at Trump’s direction. He has since re-registered as a Democrat, and last month urged Americans to vote against Republicans to prevent “another two or another six years of this craziness.” It’s not clear which of Obama’s comments Cohen was referring to in his tweet on Sunday, or if he was speaking about the “20/20” interview in general. At one point, Obama was asked what goes through her mind when she hears news about the Trump administration. She replied: “Being the commander-in-chief is a hard job. And you need to have discipline and you need to read and you need to be knowledgeable. You need to know history, you need to be careful with your words. But voters make those decisions. And once the voters have spoken, you know, we live with what we live with.” ABC’s Robin Roberts also asked Obama what she hopes her legacy will be. “Young people are the future,” Obama said. “And if my story, my journey, somehow gives them hope, if I played a role in that for some young people comin’ down the line, then I’ll feel good about it.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-trump-inauguration-smile-becoming_us_5be91ef7e4b0e84388997431---split---Former first lady Michelle Obama has revealed that she “stopped even trying to smile” during the 2017 inauguration of President Donald Trump in an interview with ABC that aired Sunday night. Reading from her forthcoming memoir, Becoming, Obama said that the “vibrant diversity” of her husband’s two previous inaugurations “was gone” on the day Trump took office. “Someone from Barack’s administration might have said that the optics were bad ― that what the public saw didn’t reflect the president’s reality or ideals,” she said. “But in this case, maybe it did. Realizing it, I made my own optic adjustment: I stopped even trying to smile.” “I stopped even trying to smile,” @MichelleObama shares what she was feeling during President Trump’s 2017 Presidential Inauguration. #MichelleObama #Michellehttps://t.co/GG1GiLxNVX pic.twitter.com/iBq38HR5hv Obama also recounted the rage and fear that she had felt in the lead up to the Trump’s election, especially after the surfacing of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape. Writing in her book, the former first lady said that she had faith that when Americans went to the polls, they would understand “the true nature of what they were choosing between.” “I implored people to focus and to think about what it takes to be the commander in chief,” she told the ABC’s Robin Roberts. “It’s amazing to me that we still have to tell people about the importance of voting ... People have to be educated, they have to be focused on the issues and they have to go to the polls if they want their politics to reflect their values.” Watch Obama discuss how she felt during Trump’s inauguration in the clip above.
---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/richard-ojeda-presidential-committee---split---State Sen. Richard Ojeda lost his bid for the 3rd District by nearly 13 points last week. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) On the heels of his losing congressional bid in West Virginia, state Sen. Richard Ojeda, has filed to run for the Democratic nomination for president. Ojeda filed paperwork Sunday night with the Federal Election Commission creating a principal campaign committee with the name “Ojeda for President.” The filing does not list a year. An email to supporters told them to tune in for a noon announcement on Monday. Ojeda voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, but he failed to win over enough Trump voters to carry West Virginia's 3rd District last week. With the backing Trump, GOP state Del. Carol Miller defeated Ojeda by nearly 13 points in the southern West Virginia district that’s home to many of the state’s coal mines. (She could be the only new Republican woman in the next Congress.) Trump carried the district by nearly 50 points in 2016 and remains popular in the region. A retired Army major, Ojeda made national news when he was beaten with brass knuckles days before his state Senate primary in 2016. He continued to garner national press throughout early 2017 and 2018 as an example of a Democrat who could appeal in Trump country. Ojeda ran an unconventional campaign, but the national party eventually got behind him over the summer. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added him to its Red to Blue list for strong recruits, and he started working with national operatives like veteran Democratic pollster Jef Pollock, who was tipped off to Ojeda’s candidacy by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III. The campaign team listed on Ojeda’s Sunday night FEC filing includes his original team from his congressional bid. Madalin Sammons, who served as communications director for Ojeda’s congressional bid, is listed as the “designated agent” for the presidential committee. Steven Hall is listed as the campaign manager for the presidential committee. He’s Ojeda’s brother-in-law and also served as finance chairman for his congressional campaign.

---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/US/officials-order-evacuations-camp-fire-threatens-8000-acres/story?id=59065896---split---At least 31 people have been killed as massive wildfires raging in Northern and Southern California have engulfed thousands of homes and were threatening to destroy more as blustery winds were dealing firefighters a menacing challenge throughout the state over the weekend and into today. "This week, California has experienced the most destructive fires we have seen in its history. There are 196,000 acres burned, thousands of homes and dozens of lives lost," Chief Scott Jalbert of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Sunday morning. The largest and deadliest of the infernos is the Camp Fire, which as of Sunday had burned 109,000 acres, leveled 6,435 homes and another 260 commercial structures in Northern California's Butte County, according to officials. There were at least 228 people unaccounted for as of early Monday. At least 29 civilians have been killed in the Camp Fire, which ignited on Thursday and quickly swept through communities in the Sierra foothills, nearly wiping out the bucolic town of Paradise. At least five firefighters have been injured battling the blaze.   On Sunday, the monstrous fire was 25 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. Two other people were killed in the Woolsey Fire burning in Southern California, bringing the death toll from the California wildfires to 25 on Sunday. The threat from the Camp Fire isn't expected to diminish anytime soon, as gusty weather ramped back up Sunday. Red flag warnings signaling extreme fire danger have been issued for parts of Northern California, including the areas surrounding Sacramento and San Jose. More than 149,000 people throughout the Golden State have evacuated as a result of the fires, outgoing California Gov. Jerry Brown told reporters Sunday afternoon.  California Gov. Jerry Brown on devastating wildfires raging across the state: "This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal." "Unfortunately, the best science is telling us that dryness, warmth, drought, all those things, they’re gonna intensify." https://t.co/ZIGpn8tOn8 pic.twitter.com/EkzVvJBjlW  Wind gusts could reach 50 mph across the eastern foothills and western slopes of the northern Sierra Nevada mountain range through today, as well as parts of the Sacramento Valley. On Saturday, Shawn Field of Paradise didn't know if his house was still standing. On Sunday morning, an ABC News crew found Field's home completely destroyed. The only thing left intact was a green coffee cup. "This is real," Field said. Field said he and his family moved into the house on Honey Run Road in March. He said his son was home when the fire moved close to their house on Thursday and that he had about 10 minutes to pack up some belongings and get out. "He was able to pack a backpack and a small duffle bag of things we could use, and that's all we have," said Field, who is staying with friends about 15 miles away in Chico. Despite his loss, Field said his spirits have been boosted by the support he and his family have gotten from friends and strangers. "It's awesome how many people are rallying around and helping us out," he told ABC News.  Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire in Southern California was only 15 percent contained Sunday after blackening 85,500 acres across Los Angeles and Ventura counties and destroying 177 structures, Cal Fire said. Another fire burning in the area, the Hill Fire, was 70 percent contained Sunday after it consumed 4,531 acres in Ventura County near Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people Wednesday night at a country bar before taking his own life. "This morning, the Santa Ana wind condition has reestablished itself and is going to be in the area for the next couple of days," said Tony Imbrenda, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Two people were found dead in Malibu from the Woolsey Fire, officials from Cal Fire said. Detectives believe that the victims, found in a vehicle off the Mulholland Highway, were killed after the driver became disoriented while evacuating and the car was overcome by fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Cmdr. Scott Gage said in a press conference Sunday afternoon.  "Oh my God, I'm surrounded by fire." Woman faces harrowing drive as she attempts to flee the encroaching Woolsey Fire on the neighborhoods near Malibu Lake. The blaze has torched more than 83,000 acres and is only 10% contained. https://t.co/GyvtyWzqcH pic.twitter.com/6kimK0ISAE  More than 3,200 firefighters battling the Woolsey Fire are bracing for more tough days to come on the fire lines due to strong Santa Ana winds of up to 40 mph that threaten to blow embers into areas that have not burned, officials said. "This is a wind-driven event and the winds are coming back," Chief John Benedict of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Sunday. "Everybody needs to remain vigilant and please stay out of the areas that we've determined to be evacuation zones."   Benedict said the cities of Hidden Hills, Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Calabasas and Malibu remained under evacuation orders. He also said the fire appeared to be moving west toward the Pacific Ocean and he advised residents in Topanga Canyon to evacuate. "We have reports of numerous residents in the Topanga area that have chosen to shelter in place and we're advising them to immediately leave and move to one of the shelters or to other locations out of danger," said Benedict, adding that he and his family have been evacuated twice since the fire broke out. In addition, 3,500 students at Pepperdine University -- which sits atop a picturesque Malibu mountain overlooking the Pacific Ocean -- are sheltering in place, Gage said  Ventura County Fire Department Chief Mark Lorenzen implored people to leave evacuation zones. He said the fire was burning everything in its path including ice plant. "Ice plant is not supposed to burn," Lorenzen said Sunday. "So my message to the community today is maybe 10 to 20 years ago you stayed in your homes when there was a fire and you were able to protect them. Things are not the way they were 10 years ago. The rate of spread is exponentially more than what it used to be." On Friday and Saturday, 23 bodies were discovered in communities ravaged by the Camp Fire, most of them found in Paradise, the Sierra foothills town of 26,551 people that was almost completely destroyed in the blaze. An additional six bodies were later found, Butte County officials announced Sunday evening. The Camp Fire is now one of the deadliest wildfires in California history, tied at No. 1 with the 1933 Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles, which also claimed 29 lives, according to Cal Fire. At nearly 7,000 structures burned, the Camp Fire is also the state's most destructive.   Four of those victims were found dead in or near torched vehicles. Autopsies will be conducted to determine the circumstances of the deaths and to identify the individuals, but investigators believe their cars were "overcome" by the flames, according to a statement from the Butte County Sheriff's Office on Friday night. There were more than 100 people missing in the region, though officials were working to track them down. At least 70 people reported missing were located on Saturday and are now safe, officials said. The Butte County Sheriff's Office has activated a call center for the public to provide and receive information about those thought to be missing.   Authorities have received reports of additional fatalities due to the blaze, which investigators are working to confirm.   Some 52,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. Pulga, Concow, Magalia, Stirling City and the entire town of Paradise were among the areas that were under mandatory evacuation orders, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. "The task is difficult due to the fact that the fire is still active and there are many hazards in areas where fatalities have been reported," the sheriff's office said in the statement. The governor-elect of California, Gavin Newsom, on Thursday issued an emergency proclamation for Butte County due to the Camp Fire. On Sunday, Brown requested President Trump issue a Major Disaster Declaration to bolster the ongoing emergency response and aid residents in their recovery from devastating fires throughout the state.   "We have the best firefighters and first responders in the country working in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable," Brown said in a statement Sunday. "We're putting everything we've got into the fight against these fires and this request ensures communities on the front lines get additional federal aid. To those who have lost friends and family members, homes and businesses, know that the entire state is with you. As Californians, we are strong and resilient, and together we will recover."  Late on Friday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for California, freeing up federal resources to supplement local response efforts. The declaration allows the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts to help alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, provide support for emergency measures and free up federal resources. But on Saturday morning, Trump threatened to pull federal funding for California wildfires if the state didn't "remedy" its poor "forest management." "Our focus is on the Californians impacted by these fires and the first responders and firefighters working around the clock to save lives and property — not on the president’s inane and uninformed tweets," Brown's press secretary, Evan Westrup, told ABC News on Sunday. Brian Rice, president of California Professional Firefighters, called Trump's threat to slash funds for battling California wildfires "ill-informed, ill-timed, demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines." Rice said Trumps assertion that California's forest management policies are to blame for the catastrophic wildfires is "dangerously wrong." "Wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation, high winds, low humidity and geography," Rice said. ABC News' Karma Allen, Stacy Chen, Matthew Fuhrman, Julia Jacobo, Bonnie Mclean and Daniel Peck contributed to this report.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-funding-puerto-rico_us_5be911fee4b0dbe871ac9c03---split---President Donald Trump wants to stop sending federal relief money to Puerto Rico, an American territory, following last year’s devastating Hurricane Maria, according to a report Sunday in Axios. Trump reportedly believes, without evidence, that the Puerto Rican government has been mishandling the relief funding and using it to pay off debt, according to the outlet’s Jonathan Swan. The president made that conclusion after misreading an article in The Wall Street Journal last month, Swan reports, and told Congressional leaders that he “doesn’t want to include additional Puerto Rico funding in further spending bills.” There is no evidence that the territory has not been using any of its relief funds to pay off debt obligations, and the island’s leadership has actually argued against doing so, according to The Washington Post. Trump first alluded to his frustrations with the relief funds last month, saying “inept politicians” were attempting to use the “ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations.” The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations. The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money! Puerto Rico is still recovering from the devastation left by Maria in late 2017. The island’s government revised death tolls from the storm up to 2,975 in August, numbers that Trump himself has denied multiple times on Twitter. More than $6 billion has been allocated to help aid storm recovery, but hundreds of thousands of people are still waiting for help, living in homes that are in desperate need of repair, according to The New York Times. The island’s leadership has said it needs billions more to rebuild, and in February said that it would cost at least $17 billion just to fix its beleaguered power grid. Swan reported Sunday that Trump has even proposed demanding some of the money already allocated to relief back. The president has regularly lashed out at the Puerto Rican government throughout the crisis, and even suggested that the storm’s impact wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like 2005′s Hurricane Katrina. After Trump’s latest attempts to downplay the death toll, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló lambasted the White House and said that the “victims and the people of Puerto Rico do not deserve to have their pain questioned.” “The people of Puerto Rico deserve a full accounting of the impact of the storm, and they deserve recognition of that impact by our president,” Rosselló wrote. “It is not time to deny what happened. It is time to make sure that it does not happen again.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

Trump won a “worst supporting actor” Razzie Award in 1991 for his performance in “Ghosts Can’t Do It.” Oliver then shared a scene from the film that featured Trump making a “kissy face,” which led to this reaction: “That kissy face is the single most disgusting thing that’s ever been in a movie ― and I’m very much including ‘The Human Centipede,’” Oliver said. But Oliver didn’t spend his segment looking at Trump’s failed attempt at a film career. Instead, he focused on the president’s failed attempt to fulfill his 2016 campaign promise to “drain the swamp.” “It won’t remotely surprise you to know that he has not drained the swamp even one little bit,” Oliver said before listing some of the industry insiders who’ve joined the Trump administration.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/nafta-trump-democratic-house.html---split---Supported by By Glenn Thrush WASHINGTON — President Trump’s promise to quickly pass a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has been upended by the midterm elections, with Democrats who will soon control the House vowing to withhold their support to extract greater protections for American workers. Administration officials remain confident they will corral the votes for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump speedily negotiated in September to claim a big win on one of his signature issues before the November elections. While White House officials considered pushing the revised deal through the coming lame-duck session, they did not want to risk a backlash from lawmakers in both parties. Democrats, emboldened by their midterm win and eager to outshine Mr. Trump as defenders of the American worker, are unlikely to sign off on any deal that does not include significant changes that labor leaders and newly elected progressives are demanding. That could involve reopening negotiations with Mexico, although American and Mexican negotiators have both publicly ruled out that possibility. “Trump made it seem like this was a done deal, but there is a long, long way to go,” said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who is likely to be named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade. The House will consider the agreement first under the Constitution’s provision mandating that revenue bills originate in the lower chamber. A vote could take up to nine months or longer, according to senior administration officials. House Democrats are particularly concerned about a provision that would require at least 30 percent of the labor used to build each car in Mexico to be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That amount will rise to 40 percent by 2023 but the $16 wage is not indexed to inflation, meaning the increase will be diluted over time as prices rise. The text of the agreement also requires Mexico to make it easier for workers to join unions. All of these actions were intended to make it less likely that automakers and other manufacturers would shift American jobs south for cheaper labor. But Democrats and their allies in manufacturing unions — who have remained neutral on the proposed pact — maintain that the new requirements, while an improvement on the original Nafta, do not go far enough. They are demanding more specifics about how the deal will be enforced, and raising questions about whether the $16-an-hour benchmark for Mexican workers — which is about four times the typical wage for Mexican autoworkers — is high enough to stanch the flow of American jobs to Mexico. “Without enforcement you don’t have anything. Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding Nafta,” Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said last week, days before voters swept her party back into power. “Right now, it is a work in progress,” said Mrs. Pelosi, a former speaker who is expected to reclaim that post. “Mexico has to pass a law about labor rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement. Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, have both said publicly that they will not take up the agreement this year, although several free-trade proponents in their own party, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are urging them to reconsider. Mr. Toomey has his own reservations about the deal — he believes it includes too many potential restrictions on free trade — but he warned his fellow Republicans that entering a protracted negotiation with Democrats would be a losing strategy. “I would be shocked — shocked — to learn that Nancy Pelosi is going to make passing new Nafta, which would be a big win for the president, her top priority,” he said. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has repeatedly assured Mr. Trump that he will be able to sell the deal to Democrats and the leaders of the United Steelworkers Union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Autoworkers Union, according to current and former White House officials. “We are very confident that Congress will approve U.S.M.C.A.,” said Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “From the beginning, Ambassador Lighthizer has worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate on the renegotiation of this agreement,” he said, adding that the pact “is a balanced deal with strong provisions that will benefit U.S. businesses and workers and that enjoys broad support among key stakeholders.” But there are signs that Mr. Lighthizer, who has a close working relationship with many labor leaders and pro-union Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, may have a tougher time than he anticipated. “Words on a paper won’t stop jobs from going to Mexico, unless there’s real teeth behind them,” Mr. Brown said. In late October, Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers Union and chairman of the United States trade representative’s labor advisory council, reviewed the preliminary text of the deal and concluded that the new agreement contained provisions that “undermine the interests of workers and consumers” while doing too little to “curtail the illegal suppression of wages in Mexico,” according to a letter sent to Mr. Lighthizer. In the letter, Mr. Gerard took issue with the administration’s decision to maintain steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and questioned the effectiveness of the agreement’s proposed automotive rules of origin intended to increase the percentage of cars built by American workers. But he saved his sharpest criticism for the Mexican wage provisions, arguing that the $16 hour average wage mandated in the deal “is arguably too low to make a significant difference” in persuading manufacturers to keep their plants in the United States. He suggested making the wage standard a minimum, rather than an average, and suggested indexing it to inflation to ensure that the wage increases aren’t “meaningless.” Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a populist who was elected president of Mexico in July, supports wage increases but it is unclear if he can pass sweeping labor reforms through the country’s legislature. During a private meeting with House members of both parties last month, Mr. Lighthizer conceded that the labor provisions needed to be strengthened, but he declined to reopen talks with Mexico, according to three people who attended the meeting. The Nafta vote will be up or down, and Congress cannot amend the text, according the rules governing fast-track trade agreements. But negotiators from each country are free to negotiate potential changes to secure enough votes for passage in their respective chambers. Mexican officials have said the labor standards in the deal are sufficient. Mr. Emerson said Mr. Lighthizer rejected as “false” the idea that he would consider reopening the deal. The labor standards included in the deal, he added, “are ambitious and enforceable,” he said. But Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who attended the meeting last month, called the provision “a major flaw” and said “there will have to be some attempt to discuss this with Mexico” in order for the deal to win Democratic backing. Mr. Lighthizer remains eager to conclude a deal as quickly as possible, people close to him said, so he can focus on China, whose trade practices he sees as a far bigger threat to American workers than Nafta, which has helped stitch together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States. But there’s one tactic he refuses to use to break the logjam: withdrawing from Nafta as a means of pressuring legislators to act quickly. Mr. Trump has raised the possibility repeatedly since being elected, but has been talked out of it by Mr. Lighthizer and other advisers, most recently the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of the situation.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/briefing/california-florida-michelle-obama.html---split---Supported by By Mike Ives (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: The wildfires raging across the state have created a double nightmare for residents: Many of those trying to flee have found the roads to safety clogged. As of Sunday night, the Camp Fire across more than 111,000 acres near the town of Paradise had killed 29 people, matching a 1933 blaze that was the deadliest in California history. Seven of the victims died in their vehicles. And outside Los Angeles, a mass evacuation from a fire in the Malibu area has been hampered by congestion on the Pacific Coast Highway, leaving at least two dead. That blaze is expected to worsen in the coming days. Our Climate reporters explain why the state has so many wildfires. • Video: Footage of the destruction. • Maps: Track the fires. • How to help: Research before you donate. At a ceremony in Paris for the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, President Emmanuel Macron of France rebuked the nationalist impulses that are reshaping the world today. “Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,” Mr. Macron told world leaders at the ceremony. “Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying: ‘Our interest first. Who cares about the others?’ ” The comments were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump’s “America First” brand of nationalism, and highlighted how the two men’s relationship has soured. • Security, or snub? Mr. Trump’s two-day visit to Paris was marred by the cancellation of his planned visit to an American cemetery. Aides said his helicopter couldn’t fly in the rain, but the decision went over badly. • In photos: Here are some of the best images of the remembrance events. Winning control of the House may have been the easy part. Now the Democrats must find a way to execute their agenda while facing a president who disdains institutional norms. (“Don’t chase every ball that he throws” is how one representative described the party’s approach.) Among their first moves: demanding that President Trump’s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, who once said there was “no collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia, recuse himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation. • Election checks: Gov. Rick Scott of Florida is challenging the handling of ballots in three state races that are undergoing recounts. He says there was fraud, but the truth appears more complicated. Last year, intelligence operatives from Saudi Arabia discussed hiring private companies to kill Iranian enemies of the kingdom, people familiar with the discussions told The Times. The disclosure indicates that top Saudi officials have considered assassinations since the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, began consolidating power, a year before the killing last month of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It may add to pressure on President Trump — who is ending air refueling flights for the Saudi military campaign in Yemen — to take stronger punitive measures against the kingdom. • Seeking answers: The British foreign secretary is traveling to Saudi Arabia today to press Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, for information on the Khashoggi killing, two days after Turkey said it had given recordings of the killing to Britain, the U.S. and other Western countries. President Trump has said that the North Korean nuclear threat is over. But a study being published today identifies 16 previously secret missile bases in the North that could bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. At the same time, U.S. sanctions against Pyongyang are collapsing. That gives Secretary of State Mike Pompeo less leverage. (It’s just one of many challenges he faces). • The vice president in Japan: Mike Pence arrived in the country today for a two-day visit. He’s scheduled to discuss North Korea’s nuclear program with President Shinzo Abe. • “Nanoinfluencers” are the next frontier in corporate branding. They’ll typically say anything in exchange for free products or (small) commissions. • Hollywood is in crisis as it faces mega-mergers, the fallout from #MeToo, and Big Tech’s march into entertainment, our reporter writes. • Silicon Valley is undermining democracy, Yuval Noah Harari says. So why do tech chiefs love him? • A U.S. trade commission will submit a report this week on the impact of the agreement to replace Nafta. That’s one of the headlines in “With Interest,” our new business and tech newsletter. Sign up here. • U.S. stocks were down on Friday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Patience is worth cultivating. • Being in a funk isn’t always bad. • Recipe of the day: Savory-sweet pasta aglio olio with butternut squash. • Representative Dana Rohrabacher lost a bid for re-election in California, highlighting the Republican Party’s setbacks in a part of the state it once dominated. • A covert Israeli mission apparently went awry in the Gaza Strip, killing at least seven Palestinians and setting off airstrikes and rocket fire. • The police in Australia arrested a woman accused of spiking strawberries with needles. • A commercial rocket that was launched in New Zealand may be the beginning of a new era in the space business. • The Tennessee Titans upset the New England Patriots. Here are the highlights from Week 10 in the N.F.L. • “Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch” earned about $66 million and the top spot at the domestic box office. • Michelle Obama’s memoir In “Becoming,” she talks about suffering a miscarriage, relying on IVF to conceive and the challenges of being the first African-American first lady. • Speaking up on dementia Sandra Day O’Connor, the retired Supreme Court justice, is among a growing group of public figures choosing to make their diagnoses public. • Canada’s message on cannabis Teenagers in the country use more marijuana than youths anywhere else in the world. The government hopes legalization will change that. • Hunting for medicine in China Terminally ill patients in the country often have to use underground pharmacies or make drugs themselves using instructions they find online. • Quotation of the day “These Democrats didn’t get elected, by and large, to war with Trump. They got elected to try and get some positive things done on issues like health care and economic issues.” — David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Barack Obama, on challenges facing the new House. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we’re listening to Jennifer Jett, an editor in Hong Kong, recommends this from Metro in Britain: “An exhibit at the Imperial War Museum in London commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, which was Sunday, features a painstaking recreation of what it may have sounded like when the guns fell silent at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. (The Smithsonian explains how the sound engineers created the installation.)” Today, representatives of major Pacific nations gathered in Papua New Guinea for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting. To prepare, the tiny nation not only imported a fleet of gleaming Maseratis, but also unveiled a six-lane boulevard near the Parliament House built via Chinese loans. It is just one of Beijing’s many efforts to compete for global influence. Some are white elephants, like the little-used $1 billion Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. Then there’s the world’s longest sea bridge — 34 miles linking Hong Kong with Macau and the mainland city of Zhuhai. Perhaps China’s best-known construction oddities are within China: ghost cities — see the desert city of Ordos — and empty airports. The Changhai Airport at one point serviced one route. “Call in two to three days to check if there’s a flight,” an airport official told Reuters in 2015. “The plane’s under maintenance.” Amy Qin wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.people-press.org/2018/11/05/more-now-say-its-stressful-to-discuss-politics-with-people-they-disagree-with/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  U.S. Politics & Policy Liberal Democrats most likely to say it is stressful Over the past two years, Americans have become more likely to say it is “stressful and frustrating” to have political conversations with those they disagree with. The change in opinions has come largely among Democrats: 57% now say that talking about politics with people they disagree with is stressful and frustrating, up from 45% two years ago. By contrast, Republicans’ feelings about political conversations with people they disagree have changed very little. About half (49%) continue to find such conversations stressful and frustrating. Overall, 53% of Americans say talking about politics with people they disagree with is generally stressful and frustrating; fewer (45%) say such conversations are usually “interesting and informative.” In March 2016, during the presidential primaries, slightly more found such conversations interesting and informative (51%) than stressful and frustrating (46%). The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 24 to Oct. 7, also finds that a majority of Americans (63%) say that when discussing politics with people they disagree with they find they usually have less in common politically than they thought. Views of whether such conversations lead to more common ground politically – unlike opinions about whether they are informative or stressful – do not differ by partisanship. Majorities in both parties say they find they usually have less in common politically when discussing politics with those who have differing views. In both parties, there are ideological differences in views of whether conversations with those they disagree with politically are stressful or not. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 63% of liberals say such conversations are stressful and frustrating, compared with 51% of conservatives and moderates. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, somewhat more conservatives (53%) than moderates and liberals (44%) say it is stressful to discuss politics with those they disagree with. A majority of Americans (63%) say that when they talk about politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought previously. Fewer than a third of Americans (31%) say they find they have more in common with people they disagree with politically. These opinions have changed only modestly since 2016, when 63% said that when discussing politics with people they disagreed with, they had less in common than they thought. There is little division across the partisan and ideological spectrum: More than six-in-ten in each group say they find that when they discuss politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought. Currently, a majority (62%) of Americans say Donald Trump’s presidency and policies come up very often (25%) or somewhat often (37%) in conversation. Far fewer (38%) say Trump comes up not too often or not at all often. That is similar to people’s views of how often Trump came up in conversation in December 2016, shortly after his presidential victory. At that time, 25% said Trump’s election and plans for his presidency came up in conversations very often, while 40% said they were topics somewhat often. As was the case in late 2016, Trump is a more frequent topic of conversation for liberal Democrats than for other Democrats or among Republicans. Currently, 42% of liberal Democrats say Trump’s presidency comes up in conversations very often; that is double the share of conservatives and moderates who say this. Among Republicans, Trump comes up more in conversation among conservatives (23% very often) than among GOP moderates and liberals (15%). The share of conservative Republicans who say Trump comes up very often in conversation has slipped since 2016, from 30% then to 23% now.

Allí, bajo un calor agobiante y sin electricidad, pasan las horas a la espera de la “amenaza”: hombres, mujeres y niños migrantes que huyen del hambre y la violencia. Por THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF El primer partido de la final de la Copa Libertadores de América se jugó en una Bombonera sin ruido de los visitantes después de una suspensión de último minuto el día anterior; el triunfo definitivo se conocerá el 24 de noviembre en el estadio de River Plate. Por EZEQUIEL FERNÁNDEZ MOORES La escritora argentina Silvina Ocampo es una de esas autoras que desafían la circulación comercial y académica de la literatura.

A pesar de los numerosos éxitos, no todos los médicos están convencidos de que realmente funcionan.

Por MRIDULA AMIN y ISABELLA KWAI El presidente solicitó la renuncia de su fiscal general por su enfado respecto a la investigación especial sobre los vínculos entre Rusia y su campaña de 2016; podría abrir el camino para que Trump despida también al fiscal especial a cargo de esa pesquisa.

---split---11.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/business/media/jim-acosta-trump-media.html---split---Supported by Mediator By Jim Rutenberg The CNN chief Jeff Zucker gave his troops unexpected orders the day after President Trump snatched the press credential away from Jim Acosta, one of the network’s White House correspondents. The temptation to play it big was strong. Here was a CNN star in the middle of the action, and television news is nothing if not self-promotional. But at the regular morning meeting on Thursday, Mr. Zucker told his producers to stand down. This time, CNN would not be led by the nose into giving significant airtime to another Trump attack on the news media, especially when Democrats were preparing to take over the House and Jeff Sessions was being forced out of the attorney general’s office. It was a first step toward a revised approach in dealing with the president’s anti-media antics, which reached a new level last week when Mr. Trump went beyond mere rhetoric by taking away Mr. Acosta’s White House press pass and threatening to do the same for anyone else who failed to show “respect.” Other news organizations appeared to follow Mr. Zucker’s lead, resisting the urge, for once, to allow the president to turn them into hapless characters in his never-ending national melodrama. But the proportionate coverage did nothing to restore Mr. Acosta’s White House access. Nor did it keep Mr. Trump from threatening to bar other reporters whose questions he doesn’t like. And so the press corps remained in a Catch-22. Reporters could stage a group protest. But that would make them look like they’re at war with the president, just as he always says they are. Or they could do nothing and effectively “submit to his authority to determine who gets to hold him accountable,” as the former Republican presidential strategist Steve Schmidt put it to me in an interview on Friday. Mr. Schmidt was on my call list as I polled strategists from both parties on how to handle the conundrum. It isn’t my habit to ask political operatives to weigh in on journalistic matters. But in bringing a reporter’s notebook to a knife fight, the White House press corps has seemed overmatched in parrying attacks from a man who flummoxed rivals with catchy sobriquets like Low Energy Jeb, Lyin’ Ted and Crooked Hillary. The strategists have more experience with this kind of thing than newspaper editors or journalism professors. “He’s Swift-Boating you guys,” said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and John Kerry. She was referring to “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,” a group that undermined one of Mr. Kerry’s strong points, his stellar war record in Vietnam. The false accusations presented the Kerry campaign with a classic campaign dilemma. To address them, even to dispute them, would only call more attention to them. And letting them go unmet would let them fester. (Mr. Kerry ultimately responded, but some Democrats complained after his loss that he did so too late.) The Trump press corps has quickly debunked mischaracterizations, as its members did after the White House made the false claim that Mr. Acosta placed “his hands” on a young aide who sought to take his microphone away as he clashed with Mr. Trump on Wednesday. But Ms. Cutter said that whenever possible, the press corps should starve the president’s attacks of attention and keep the focus on the issues. “They don’t need to cover a man who is picking fights with them for the purpose of turning out his base,” she said. “It should be about the Justice Department and trying to thwart the Russia investigation.” That still doesn’t get back the revoked press badge. Mr. Schmidt, who helped manage John McCain’s 2008 campaign and served a stint in George W. Bush’s White House, said a boycott of the White House press briefings should “at least be on the table” until Mr. Acosta’s pass is returned — especially when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, so often uses the sessions to spread falsehoods. “What they should say is the press briefing is conditioned and premised on the ability of a free press to hold government accountable,” said Mr. Schmidt, who has emerged as a critic of Mr. Trump on MSNBC and recently announced he was quitting the Republican Party. John Weaver, a lead strategist for the 2016 Republican presidential campaign of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, was more bullish on a boycott, even if means giving Mr. Trump the foil he seeks. “If you’re going to catch hell anyway, do the right thing,” said Mr. Weaver. He cited not just Mr. Acosta’s revoked pass but also Mr. Trump’s personal insults against reporters last week, including three black women who cover him. At this point, though, even the White House Correspondents’ Association has not threatened a walkout. The lack of a call to action may have something do with the fact that Mr. Acosta is a somewhat polarizing figure, viewed by some of his press corps colleagues as a showboat. But there is also the risk of a backlash if the reporters were to stay away from the next briefing. As Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and former White House adviser to Mr. Obama, told me: “That puts them in the middle of the story.” “The more they personalize this, the more it becomes a fight between the press and the president, as opposed to the press doing its job,” she added. “When they are covering the story, as opposed to being the story, they’re on firmer ground.” I found rare agreement between Ms. Dunn and a onetime opponent, Jim Dyke, a top strategist for the Republican National Committee during the George W. Bush years. He spoke to me from South Dakota, where he was hunting pheasant and where, he said, people “don’t give a flip” about Mr. Acosta’s credential. When I asked him what advice he would offer members of the media if they were his client, he gave me an earful. “It’s not about them, and they obsessively make it about them, and it’s not, and that’s step one,” he said. In his view, reporters are too strident when they challenge the president, either in person or on Twitter. “If you’re running a campaign and your candidate is seething at the other person, and all they can talk about is, ‘That S.O.B. is an idiot,’ they typically lose campaigns,” he said. His advice? “Get back on track. Calm down. Show the office of the presidency the respect it deserves.” Before I could jump in, he went on. “Now they’ll say, ‘How can we respect it when he doesn’t?’ O.K., that’s his problem. You showing it respect further elevates you above him, instead of being dragged down to his level.” But, but, but — the press badge! Mr. Dyke said that if the administration were to deny access to other reporters, “and the press makes a substantial, thoughtful case, people will be outraged.” For now, though, he said, “Because Jim Acosta lost his hard pass, the press isn’t able to do its job?” Mr. Acosta answered the question via Instagram on Friday as his network weighed bringing a lawsuit against President Trump. The selfie he posted showed him smiling in Ray Bans, the Eiffel Tower at his back. “Greetings from Paris,” he trolled. He had flown there on his own — as opposed to aboard Air Force One — to cover Mr. Trump’s visit. He was showing that reporting without a license is not a crime. At least for now.     Advertisement
---split---11.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/meet-jerry-nadler-next-house-judiciary-chairman-trumps-new-enemy-no-1---split---Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is poised to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Jerrold Nadler remembers when he began to figure out that you’ve got to fight back when life seems unfair. It was 1957. Nadler was 10. He was at home in Brooklyn watching Disney’s film production of the 1943 novel “Johnny Tremain,” a young apprentice of silversmith Paul Revere on the eve of the American Revolution. In the movie’s climatic scene, colonial lawyer James Otis delivers a rallying speech to revolutionaries in a cramped wooden attic in Boston. Otis was the colonial lawyer whose five-hour speech in 1761 decrying British “writs of assistance” would later become the foundation of the Fourth Amendment protecting Americans from unreasonable search and seizure. At the end of his winding speech, the fictionalized Otis scans the room and leaves his comrades with a parting message: “We fight and die for a simple thing — only that a man can stand.” “I still remember watching it,” said Nadler, whom aides and confidants claim has a photographic memory. Not long after that, the New York Democrat remembers, articles started appearing in the newspapers about the Supreme Court upholding convictions of people whose confessions had been beaten out of them by police. Only two justices, Hugo Black and William Douglas, issued dissenting opinions. “Seven to two, Black and Douglas dissenting. There were a number of such decisions, always Black and Douglas dissenting,” Nadler said. “I remember getting very angry and saying, ‘I’ve got to do something about that.’” Now, 61 years later, the lifetime politician who got his start in 1977 as a New York assemblyman while he was still attending Fordham Law School at night is ready to fight back. Watch: Following Sessions Ouster, How and Why Many Key Officials Have Exited the Trump Administration First elected to Congress in 1992, Nadler is poised to become the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January after the Democrat-controlled 116th Congress is sworn in. Immigration, voting rights, and Justice Department oversight — read: Mueller investigation — are just three of the politically charged issues under the committee’s jurisdiction. That means Nadler, who has represented Manhattan’s West Side, the financial district, and a sliver of Brooklyn for nearly three decades in the House, controls the gavel of the committee where Congress carries out impeachment proceedings. Before the midterms, Democratic leaders skillfully dodged questions about impeaching President Donald Trump were they to win back a majority. Now that they have one, Democrats are still treading cautiously. At her victory speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Committee, Nancy Pelosi stressed that Democrats would try to “unify” the country. She did not mention Congress’ oversight role over the Trump administration, and she certainly did not mention the I-word. Nadler has likewise skirted around such questions, though he said he is eager to conduct oversight hearings on the Trump administration’s policies of separating immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, increases in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes since the president took office, and voter suppression, not to mention Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And after Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, Nadler promised that the move “will be investigated and people will be held accountable” if lawmakers discover the president has abused his power to interfere in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s ongoing probe. “The question of impeachment is down the road,” Nadler told Roll Call in a wide-ranging interview in which he cast doubts over whether Democrats would ever reach a point where they would seriously pursue impeaching Trump. “As far as impeachment is concerned, we have to see what Mueller comes up with,” Nadler said. “I certainly wouldn’t predict it.” Though he hails from one of the most liberal districts in the country, New York’s 10th, Nadler’s political demeanor more closely resembles the calculated coolness of party leaders than the pot-stirring of liberal firebrands such as California Rep. Maxine Waters, the presumed next House Financial Services chairwoman, whose dedicated opposition to Trump has lately defined her political image. Friends in New York, House colleagues, and former staffers describe the Brooklyn native as a measured, methodical “constitutional scholar,” obsessed with politics and political history. Multiple former aides could not identify a single hobby of his that didn’t include reading or debating public policy with his friends. “Hobbies? He doesn’t have any,” said Brett Heimov, Nadler’s former Washington chief of staff. “Reading books — that’s his hobby.” The son of a Jewish chicken farmer, Nadler, who stopped growing — at least, vertically — long ago at 5-foot-4, is the only yeshiva-educated member of Congress. He does not drink. The most alcohol Nadler will consume is on Jewish holidays: a sip or two of Manischewitz for the Kiddush ritual. For a man poised to chair the committee that works on bills regulating the fashion industry, Nadler is remarkably blithe about his appearance. A ketchup stain on his shirt has never bothered him so long as it can be covered up when he dons his blazer. As men’s pants have tightened over the years, Nadler has held onto his loose, pleated britches. And he has progressively hiked them higher and higher up his waist, to the point where they’re now suspended well above his belly button. The presumed next Judiciary chairman is a creature of habit and consistency, those around him have said. He’s been eating for decades at the same greasy spoon in the Upper West Side’s lower 70s, where for 10 bucks you can get an overcooked western omelette with a “side” of six sizzling bacon strips and rye toast with jam. Staff assistants learn quickly not to let the mini fridge in his Rayburn Building office run out of Diet Coke. He has retained senior staff in Washington and field directors in his district at an astonishingly high rate. Nadler’s Washington director, John Doty, has been with him since the congressman’s first full term. Same with his scheduler, Janice Siegel. “Twelve years, 20 years, they’ve stuck with him,” said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, a longtime friend. “He’s always had good staff around him.” Even as he paces toward the House floor for votes in his straight-backed, low-chinned duck walk, usually clutching some mysterious manila folder, Nadler never accelerates his rhythm as members and their aides scramble past him and the reporters lurking along the series of double swinging doors outside the House chamber. Just about the only thing that has changed about Nadler since the 1990s is his weight. In the early 2000s, the congressman peaked at a gargantuan 338 pounds. The butt of countless bodyweight jokes, even among his peers, during the Clinton impeachment trial, Nadler used to take the elevator up to the second floor of the Capitol for votes because he just couldn’t make it up a lone flight of stairs. He underwent a stomach-reduction surgery during Congress’ August recess in 2002 and eventually cut his weight roughly in half. He has kept his weight under control since. When Republicans see him on TV over these next two years as he leads oversight hearings on the Trump administration, many are bound not to recognize him. Since arriving in Washington in 1992 after a 15-year stint in the New York state Assembly in Albany representing liberal Manhattan, Nadler has lived out of a suitcase in a series of hotels whenever he’s in town for work. For the first few years, he stayed at the Howard Johnson’s near the George Washington University campus. “The HoJo worked for me in Albany,” Nadler told his staff at the time. “It’ll work here.” The congressman was forced to “move” when the university bought the building and turned it into underclassman housing. He had a few run-ins with Democratic leaders in the early ’90s. The Senate back then was divided equally among Democrats and Republicans, meaning President Bill Clinton, a moderate Democrat from Arkansas, had to reach across party lines to make any landmark legislative progress. From the start, Nadler opposed the sweeping 1994 crime bill that originated in the Judiciary Committee over the “three strikes” statute for previously convicted felons. After the GOP picked up 54 seats and a majority in the Newt Gingrich-led Republican Revolution in the 1994 midterm elections, Nadler confronted Democratic leadership in a head-on clash to chip away at senior members’ monopoly of power at the committee and subcommittee level. Back then, senior caucus members could double-dip as chair or ranking member for a subcommittee in addition to the full committee. That limited opportunities and stifled growth for some of the younger members of the party, Nadler and others complained. After the midterm trouncing, they agitated for a vote on a party rule that would bar Democratic chairs and ranking members from leading subcommittees, too. When Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt refused, Nadler collected the requisite 50 petition signatures to force a vote. The caucus voted to adopt the new rule, infuriating some members, including former Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell of Michigan, who was forced to give up one of his subcommittee posts. “There were a number of committee chairmen who wouldn’t talk to me for years after that,” Nadler recalled. The clash over the rule, still the party standard, is largely forgotten these days. Nadler didn’t make waves on the national scene until four years later, though, in 1998 when he emerged as one of Clinton’s most outspoken defenders during the impeachment proceedings. Nadler relished being a nettle for Republicans as they pursued allegations that Clinton had perjured himself when he told independent counsel Ken Starr in a deposition that he never had a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The New York congressman was a frequent guest on CNN and other TV networks, on which he argued that Clinton may well have perjured himself — but that alone was not grounds for impeachment. He summarized his defense of Clinton at a January 1999 town hall at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. “An impeachable offense is an abuse of presidential power designed to or with the effect of undermining the structure or function of government, or undermining constitutional liberties,” he told the crowd of several hundred. Nadler’s notions of impeachment have not changed much, even as the Democratic Party has scampered away from Clinton framed within the new context of the #MeToo era, and as the current president flouts democratic norms, actively attempts to undermine the credibility of institutions like his own Justice Department and FBI, and habitually makes unsubstantiated claims — that often appear fabricated — on just about every issue he discusses. Fanning the external impeachment chatter is the fact that half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers from the 2016 campaign have pleaded or been found guilty of crimes as a result of Mueller’s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But even if Mueller comes back with alleged criminal activity by the president, that won’t be an automatic trigger for Democrats to initiate impeachment. “The fact is, impeachment is not a criminal punishment,” Nadler told Roll Call. “There are crimes that you could commit that are not impeachable offenses and there are impeachable offenses that are not crimes. They’re different tests.” During the Clinton impeachment proceedings, Nadler believed a crucial function of the Judiciary Committee was to educate Americans about that distinction between crimes and impeachable offenses. He pushed for, and secured, a Judiciary hearing in 1998 to answer what constitutes an impeachable offense, even though Democrats were in the minority. Nadler’s impeachment theory, though, goes not one, but two steps further: Not only must Congress find that the president committed an impeachable offense, it must determine that ousting the president is a “service to the republic,” he said. “The purpose of the whole impeachment process is to protect the integrity of liberty and of the rule of law and of government, to protect against a person with aggrandized power or who destroys the separation of powers or something like that,” Nadler said. The third hurdle for impeachment is political: It must have bipartisan support. “If you’re serious about removing a president from office, what you’re really doing is overturning the result of the last election,” Nadler said. “You don’t want to have a situation where you tear this country apart and for the next 30 years half the country’s saying ‘We won the election, you stole it.’” And by bipartisan support for impeachment, Nadler does not mean winning over Republican lawmakers. “I’m talking about the voters, people who voted for Trump,” he said. “Do you think that the case is so stark, that the offenses are so terrible and the proof so clear, that once you’ve laid it all out you will have convinced an appreciable fraction of the people who voted for Trump, who like him, that you had no choice? That you had to do it?” Although impeachment appears unlikely — or, at the very least, a long way off — that does not mean Nadler will be sitting idle with his gavel in his hand these next two years. He has already promised to investigate the circumstances surrounding Sessions’ firing. The Judiciary Democrats will revisit Russian interference in the 2016 election and hold hearings on current efforts by the administration to stem the Russians’ ongoing campaign. Part of that probe will focus on “cooperation” between Russians and Americans, including, potentially, some members of Trump’s inner circle, Nadler said. Democratic investigators will take caution not to hinder the progress of Mueller’s investigation, though. “We’ll clearly look into [Russian interference],” Nadler said, “but we’ll also have to talk to the Mueller people to make sure we don’t step on anything they’re doing.” Legislatively, one of his top priorities will be to strike a deal with the Republican president and Senate on immigration, an elusive feat for recent administrations.

Linda Sánchez’s Husband Indicted for Theft of Federal Funds The “unexpected family matter” cited by California Rep. Linda T. Sánchez in withdrawing from the race for House Democratic Caucus chair relates to her husband, who was indicted on theft and conspiracy charges related to spending corporate money on personal trips, including some allegedly spent on Sánchez. “Earlier today I learned that my husband is facing charges in Connecticut,” Sánchez said in a statement Thursday. “After careful consideration of the time and energy being in leadership demands, I have decided that my focus now needs to be on my son, my family, and my constituents in California.” Sánchez, the current vice chairwoman of the Democratic Caucus, was expected to face fellow California Rep. Barbara Lee for the caucus chair position. New York Rep. Hakeem T. Jeffries joined the race earlier Thursday. Sánchez’s husband, James Sullivan, was one of five individuals associated with the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Corporation indicted by a federal grand jury for spending more than $800,000 of the corporation’s money on personal trips. The CMEEC is a cooperative public corporation that has membership agreements with Connecticut municipalities that allows the towns’ electric utilities to work together to furnish power to the combined areas. The CMEEC membership agreement requires excess revenues to be returned to the member towns to help keep electricity costs stable. The indictment against Sullivan and his CMEEC colleagues, all of whom hold or have held board or executive positions, spent corporate money on trips to the Kentucky Derby in 2015 and 2016 and to a luxury golf resort in West Virginia in 2015. They directed the funds used to pay for the trips from the CMEEC Margin account, without a vote of the board and written consent of the member towns as required by the membership agreement. The indictment says they spent more than $800,000 on travel expenses, private chartered airfare, first-class hotel accommodations, meals, tickets to sporting events, golf fees, souvenirs and gifts. Sullivan and the other four defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, and three counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds, which a maximum sentence of 10 years. A second indictment doubling the charges for Sullivan and one of the other defendants, Drew Rankin, alleges that Sullivan submitted personal expenses on his corporate expense reports that Rankin approved. Also Watch: New Members Could Spell Trouble for Pelosi's Speaker Bid The personal expenses Sullivan charged to CMEEC include airfare for dozens of flights he took and trips for his family to attend the Kentucky Derby in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The indictment also says he charged CMEEC for airfare for a flight Sánchez took to Key West, Florida, in December 2014. It is unclear if Sánchez was aware of how the trips were funded. “CMEEC has received millions of dollars in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy,” U.S. Attorney John H. Durham said in a statement. “Instead of protecting these funds and returning excess revenue to member towns and ratepayers, these defendants are alleged to have used the CMEEC Margin Account as a secret slush fund to pay for lavish junkets for themselves and their family and friends, as well as for other inappropriate expenses. Sullivan and the other four defendants pleaded not guilty Thursday to the charges at a federal court in New Haven, Conn. They were each released on a $100,000 bond.

Hakeem Jeffries announced Thursday that he is running for Democratic Caucus chair, creating another three-way leadership race. California Reps. Linda Sánchez and Barbara Lee had announced months ago they were running for caucus chair. The two had squared off against one another for vice chair in 2016, a race that Sánchez won by just two votes. Jeffries, currently a co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, entering the caucus chair contest creates even more uncertainty over who will win. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly) Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 In a letter to colleagues Jeffries said is candidacy is anchored in three principles: 1) “Our team is strongest when everyone is on the playing field.” 2) “Learn from the past, succeed in the future.” 3) “The best defense is a good offense.” Continuing the sports metaphors, he said he envisions weekly caucus meetings “as the huddle, where we collectively decide the plays to be executed to advance the ball down the field.” All three caucus chair candidates are members of the Progressive Caucus, so the vote from that large bloc of Democrats will likely be split. Sánchez will likely earn the support of much of the Hispanic Caucus, which she has previously chaired. Jeffries and Lee will probably divide the Black Caucus in this race as well.

Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington officially winning re-election on Wednesday night means that the most Latinos ever will serve in Congress. The Associated Press called her race around 10 p.m. There will be at least 42 Latinos serving, among both chambers, come January. The outstanding race for California’s 39th District open seat could add to that. Latino Democrat Gil Cisneros is running against Korean-American Republican Young Kim to replace retiring Republican Ed Royce. There were 59 Latino congressional candidates on the ballot in 2018 – 44 Democrats and 15 Republicans, PBS reported. Some were incumbents and some newcomers. Not including California 39, there will be 33 Latino Democrats and seven Latino Republicans serving in the 116th Congress. Latinos will make up 12.7 percent of Congress. Hispanics constituted for 17.8 percent of the nation’s total population in July 2016, according to the Census Bureau. Forty-one Hispanic members serve in the 115th Congress— four in the Senate and 37 in the House. Some notable newcomers include New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the new youngest members of Congress, and the first Latinas to represent Texas in the House, Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia, both Democrats. Congress is losing some strong Latino voices, including Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who won her race for the state’s governor, Florida Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring after 30 years, and Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo who lost his re-election bid. In the Senate, no newcomers are on their way in but Democrat Robert Menendez of News Jersey and Republican Ted Cruz of Texas won their re-elections. Sens. Marco Rubio and Catherine Cortez Masto were not on the ballot this cycle. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics Meet the History-Makers of the 116th Congress Diversity has been a hallmark of the 2018 midterm elections, which have seen a record number of women, minorities and first-time candidates running for office. Here are some of the history-makers from election night. Craig becomes the first openly gay lawmaker elected to Congress from Minnesota after unseating GOP Rep. Jason Lewis in the 2nd District. It was a rematch of their 2016 race, which Lewis won narrowly. Haaland shares the distinction of being the first Native American woman elected to Congress with Kansas’ Sharice Davids. An enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna, Haaland easily won the race for New Mexico’s 1st District to succeed fellow Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham. With her victory in Texas’ 16th District, Escobar, a former El Paso County judge, becomes the first Latina elected to represent the Lone Star State in Congress — along with Sylvia Garcia, who took a Houston-based seat Tuesday night. Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke vacated the 16th District seat for an unsuccessful Senate run. Garcia, a state senator, easily won Texas’ 29th District on Tuesday night, becoming the first Latina elected to Congress from the Lone Star State, an honor she shared with Escobar. Garcia ran for the seat in 1992, but lost in the primary that was eventually won by Gene Green in a runoff. Green’s retirement opened the door for her to run for the seat again, and she easily won the party primary in March. By winning Colorado’s 2nd District, Neguse becomes the first Eritrean-American elected to Congress. The son of immigrants from the East African nation, Neguse replaces fellow Democrat Jared Polis who ran for governor. The result is a happy midterm reversal for Neguse from four years ago, when he lost a race for Colorado secretary of state. Blackburn easily kept Tennessee’s Senate seat in GOP hands Tuesday night, becoming the Volunteer State’s first female senator. The eight-term congresswoman is also the first Republican woman to win statewide office in Tennessee. The daughter of Palestinian immigrants, Tlaib becomes the first Muslim-American won elected to Congress — along with Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar — after she faced only token opposition in Michigan’s heavily Democratic 13th District. She will also be the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress. Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, becomes one of the first Native American women elected to Congress after picking up Kansas’ 3rd District seat. It’s an honor she shares with New Mexico’s Haaland who also won her race Tuesday night. Davids is also the first openly gay lawmaker that Kansans have sent to Congress. With her upset of two-term Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo in Florida’s 26th District, Mucarsel-Powell becomes the first Ecuadorian-American elected to Congress. After easily winning her Minneapolis-based 5th District, Omar becomes the first Somali-American elected to Congress. She will replace Democrat Keith Ellison, who vacated the seat to run for state attorney general. Omar will also be one of the first Muslim-American women elected to Congress, along with Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib. Pressley became the first African-American Democrat to be elected to Congress from Massachusetts on Tuesday night. She faced no Republican opposition in the 7th District. The Boston city councilor is also the first African-American elected to the House from the Bay State. Pressley unseated Rep. Michael E. Capuano in a Democratic primary in September.

Politics Karen Handel Concedes in Race for Full Term in Georgia’s 6th District Democrats this week did what they failed to do in last year’s expensive special election: flip Georgia’s 6th District. Republican Rep. Karen Handel, who won that June 2017 special election to fill the open seat in the Atlanta suburbs and was running for her first full term this year, conceded Thursday morning to gun rights activist Lucy McBath. “After carefully reviewing all of the election results data, it is clear that I came up a bit short on Tuesday. Congratulations to Representative-Elect Lucy McBath and send her only good thoughts and much prayer for the journey that lies ahead for her,” Handel said in a message to supporters. “In this country, no loss, no failure, is ever final nor is it the end. God has a plan for each and every one of us,” Handel said. “Sometimes, though, HIS plan and our plan are different. So, Steve and I will be put our faith in Him and trust that whatever lies ahead will be exactly what we need.” The Associated Press has not yet called the race. With all precincts reporting, McBath led Handel 50.46 percent to 49.54 percent. McBath declared victory Wednesday night. “The voters responded to my commitment to put aside partisan fights for the good of the American people,” she said in a statement. “Six years ago, I went from a Marietta mom to a mother on a mission. After my son was lost to gun violence, I stood up and started demanding more. After Parkland, I was compelled to enter this race for Congress — to provide leadership that would be about the business of putting lives over profit. I vow to make that my top priority.” McBath had been the national spokeswoman for advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety but is currently on an unpaid leave of absence. Her son was shot and killed at a gas station in Florida in 2012 by a man who complained his music was too loud. This race attracted much less national attention and money than it did last year, when the special election between Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff became the most expensive House race in history. But national Republicans made a late investment in the 6th District last month. The National Republican Congressional Committee reserved $1.4 million for TV ads on Atlanta broadcast. McBath had outraised Handel and was benefiting from millions of dollars in outside spending from gun rights groups. — Niels Lesniewski contributed to this report.Watch: Pelosi Spoke With Trump About How They Can Work Together Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---13.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html---split---Supported by By David E. Sanger and William J. Broad WASHINGTON — North Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases that have been identified in new commercial satellite images, a network long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North’s nuclear threat. The satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception: It has offered to dismantle a major launching site — a step it began, then halted — while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. The existence of the ballistic missile bases, which North Korea has never acknowledged, contradicts Mr. Trump’s assertion that his landmark diplomacy is leading to the elimination of a nuclear and missile program that the North had warned could devastate the United States. “We are in no rush,” Mr. Trump said of talks with the North at a news conference on Wednesday, after Republicans lost control of the House. “The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home.” His statement was true in just one sense. Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to the halt of missile flight tests, which have not occurred in nearly a year. But American intelligence officials say that the North’s production of nuclear material, of new nuclear weapons and of missiles that can be placed on mobile launchers and hidden in mountains at the secret bases has continued. And the sanctions are collapsing, in part because North Korea has leveraged its new, softer-sounding relationship with Washington, and its stated commitment to eventual denuclearization, to resume trade with Russia and China. Moreover, an American program to track those mobile missiles with a new generation of small, inexpensive satellites, disclosed by The New York Times more than a year ago, is stalled. The Pentagon once hoped to have the first satellites over North Korea by now, giving it early warning if the mobile missiles are rolled out of mountain tunnels and prepared for launch. But because of a series of budget and bureaucratic disputes, the early warning system, begun by the Obama administration and handed off to the Trump administration, has yet to go into operation. Current and former officials, who said they could not publicly discuss the program because it is heavily classified, said there was still hope of launching the satellites, but they offered no timeline. The secret ballistic missile bases were identified in a detailed study published Monday by the Beyond Parallel program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a major think tank in Washington. The program, which focuses on the prospects of North-South integration, is led by Victor Cha, a prominent North Korea expert whom the Trump administration considered appointing as the ambassador to South Korea last year. His name was pulled back when he objected to the White House strategy for dealing with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. A State Department spokesman responded to the findings with a written statement suggesting that the government believed the sites must be dismantled: “President Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments, including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs, a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people.” A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment. The revelation of the bases comes as Mr. Trump’s signature piece of diplomacy, based on his meeting exactly five months ago with Mr. Kim, appears in peril. Publicly, Mr. Trump remains relentlessly optimistic, to the point that he said at a campaign rally that he and Mr. Kim, one of the world’s most brutal dictators, “fell in love.” But last week, talks with the North hit another snag, as it declared that it would not send its chief negotiator to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York to plan the next summit meeting. Since the initial meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, on June 12 in Singapore, the North has yet to take the first step toward denuclearization: providing the United States with a list of its nuclear sites, weapons, production facilities and missile bases. North Korean officials have told Mr. Pompeo that would amount to giving him a “target list.” American officials have responded that they already have a detailed target list — one that goes back decades — but want to use the North’s accounting to determine whether it is revealing all the known facilities and moving honestly toward denuclearization. The new satellite imagery suggests the opposite. “It’s not like these bases have been frozen,” Mr. Cha, the leader of the team that studied the images, said in an interview. “Work is continuing. What everybody is worried about is that Trump is going to accept a bad deal — they give us a single test site and dismantle a few other things, and in return they get a peace agreement” that formally ends the Korean War. Mr. Trump, he said, “would then declare victory, say he got more than any other American president ever got, and the threat would still be there.” The North Korea experts who have examined the images believe that the North’s motivations are fairly easy to interpret. “It looks like they’re trying to maximize their capabilities,” Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., a co-author of the report and a veteran analyst of satellite images of North Korea, said in an interview. “Any missile at these bases can take a nuclear warhead.” “The level of effort that North Korea has invested in building these bases and dispersing them is impressive,” he added. “It’s very logical from a survival point of view.” Weapons experts, as well as Mr. Pompeo, say that North Korea, despite engaging in denuclearization talks, continues to produce the fissile material that fuels nuclear arms. The North is believed to have about 40 to 60 nuclear warheads. The new report profiles a missile base known as Sakkanmol, a little more than 50 miles north of the Demilitarized Zone. It is one of the closest to South Korea. Seoul, the capital, is about 80 miles away, as are American troops. The report contains a dozen or so satellite images of Sakkanmol — each heavily annotated to show the base checkpoint, headquarters buildings, barracks, security areas, maintenance depots and the entrances to the warrens of underground tunnels that hide mobile missiles and their transporter trucks. The base runs through a narrow mountain valley over an area of three square miles. Each tunnel entrance, the report says, is protected by a neighboring berm of rock and dirt about 60 feet high and two outward-opening doors about 20 feet wide. They are meant to protect the tunnel entrances from artillery fire and aerial attack. The report says the Sakkanmol base conceals seven lengthy tunnels that can accommodate up to 18 transporters that move the missiles. Each is typically fitted with one warhead. If tensions rose, the report says, the missiles would be transported from the base to prearranged launching sites — often no more than a wide spot in a road. The mobile launchers can move quickly — they can be ready to fire in under an hour — which is why the United States has been trying to get the small satellites into the sky for early warning. The satellites have a special kind of sensor using “synthetic aperture radar” that cuts through clouds. The current, multibillion-dollar constellation of large satellites that keep an eye on North Korea is often out of position, and officials say the country’s ballistic missile sites are under surveillance less than 30 percent of the time. (The exact figure is classified.) A map of North Korea in the report shows three belts of missile bases that run from short-range tactical emplacements, to sites with midrange missiles that could strike most of South Korea, Japan and American bases in the Pacific, to strategic ones for missiles that threaten to reach American shores. The strategic bases appear to be home to the intercontinental ballistic missiles that North Korea test-fired in 2017, alarming the world. The North’s tests, while demonstrating significant progress, did not prove that it had solved all the technical problems inherent in launching a nuclear warhead that could reach the continental United States. That is why Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo have argued that the halt to missile testing is a major accomplishment: It prevents Mr. Kim from demonstrating that he can take those last steps. The report, which was also written with Lisa Collins, a research fellow at the center, supplemented the satellite imagery with interviews of North Korean defectors and government officials around the world. The North’s missile bases, with few exceptions, are “in mountainous terrain, often spread out within narrow dead-end valleys,” Mr. Bermudez said. He added, “These bases simply do not look like missile operating bases as seen in the United States, Russia, China or Europe.” Major nuclear powers tend to house their land-based missiles in underground silos, which can be vulnerable to pre-emptive attack. The North’s heavy reliance on missiles that can be repositioned with the changing circumstances of war is part of an effort to avoid that mistake, while giving the country a stronger hand in the game of nuclear diplomacy and brinkmanship. “The bases are clearly active,” Mr. Cha said. “It’s not like these things have been frozen and are decaying.”    Advertisement
---split---13.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/essentialwashington/#nt=secondarynavbar---split---Follow our coverage of the midterm elections here. Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington. Our coverage of California politics is here. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for the free politics newsletter For the first time in U.S. history, a controversial voting system known as “ranked choice” is being used to decide a federal election. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a legal challenge to President Trump's order denying asylum to migrants if they cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. The lawsuit was filed Friday in federal court in San Francisco and argues the new rules are against the law. Attorney Lee Gelernt said the regulations will put families in danger. The suit seeks to declare the regulations invalid and wants a judge to stop the rules from going into effect while the litigation is pending. President Trump is brushing off former First Lady Michelle Obama's declaration that she can't forgive him for campaign rhetoric that potentially put her family at risk. Trump instead pointed to former President Obama, telling reporters outside the White House on Friday, "She talked about safety. What he did to our military made this country very unsafe for you and you and you." Trump didn't explain what he meant. In the former first lady’s upcoming memoir, she says Trump's rhetoric barely concealed "bigotry and xenophobia" that was "dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks." President Trump is moving to distance himself from Matthew Whitaker as he faces criticism over his choice for acting attorney general. Trump told reporters Friday that "I don't know Matt Whitaker" and said he didn't speak with Whitaker about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Whitaker has made public comments critical of Mueller's investigation, and critics have called on Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the inquiry. Under former Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, the investigation was overseen by Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein. The Supreme Court says 85-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is home after being released from the hospital. She had been admitted for treatment and observation after fracturing three ribs in a fall. The court said Ginsburg was released Friday. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg says she is “doing well” and working from home. The court had previously said the justice fell in her office at the court on Wednesday evening and went to George Washington University Hospital in Washington early Thursday after experiencing discomfort overnight. Democratic gun-control activist Lucy McBath has defeated Republican Rep. Karen Handel of Georgia in a suburban congressional district long considered safe for the GOP. Handel had to seek reelection after winning her seat last year in a close special election race against Democrat Jon Ossoff. McBath became an advocate for stricter gun laws after her son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot at a Florida gas station in 2012 by a man angry over loud music the teenager and his friends were playing in a car. The Supreme Court says 85-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fractured three ribs in a fall in her office at the court and is in the hospital. The court says the justice went to George Washington University Hospital in Washington early Thursday after experiencing discomfort overnight. The court says the fall occurred Wednesday evening. Ginsburg was admitted to the hospital for treatment and observation after tests showed she fractured three ribs. The White House on Wednesday suspended the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Trump had a heated confrontation during a news conference. They began sparring after Acosta asked Trump about the caravan of migrants heading from Latin America to the southern U.S. border. When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, "That's enough!" and a female White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement accusing Acosta of "placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern," calling it "absolutely unacceptable." President Trump sparred with reporters at his post-election news conference, ordering several to sit down and telling another he's a "rude, terrible" person. He told another reporter he's "not a fan of yours, either." The president's mood turned sour Wednesday after reporters pressed him on why he referred to a migrant caravan making its way to the U.S. on foot through Mexico as an "invasion." Trump ramped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric against the caravan in the final days of the midterm elections.

---split---14.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/dem-investigative-dreams-meet-cold-hard-congressional-reality-n934136---split---WASHINGTON — When Democrats take control of the House next year, they will find themselves with new powers to investigate and embarrass the Trump administration. But their ability to use those powers may be more limited than many progressive voters may imagine. The liberal wish-list has been circulating for months, and Democratic base voters are hungry for results. Some Democrats say their top priority is obtaining President Donald Trump's tax returns, which he has repeatedly refused to release since 2016 because he's said they're under audit by the IRS. Many have their eyes set on unanswered questions surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, looking to employ subpoena authority to bring in current and former Trump advisers and secure key documents. Over the past few days alone, House Democrats have spoken of probing the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the president's possible role in hush money payments to alleged former paramours Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. And some voters — though few of the lawmakers who represent them — have expressed a desire for the House to deploy the thermonuclear presidential oversight option: impeachment. But long before Election Day, Democratic leaders were looking to temper the most ambitious expectations of the their caucus and their voters. With continued Republican control of the Senate, and a White House staunchly resistant to Democratic requests, the new House majority's road to stiffer oversight is likely to be littered with legal obstacles and hit dead ends — not to mention, some tricky political terrain. The holy grail for the president's Democratic pursuers: the tax returns he first promised to release as a Republican primary candidate before appearing to effectively abandon the pledge as president. Now some congressional panels with the authority to obtain those documents — such as the House Ways and Means Committee, which has the ability to request a person's tax returns under the tax code — will be led by members with the desire to put those abilities to use. The incoming Democratic chair of that panel could submit a written request to the IRS to provide the information. If the Treasury Department were to deny it, House Democrats would have to decide whether to pursue the tax returns through a legal route. If they were ultimately obtained, the chair would have to designate the panel's members as "agents" to read the returns. They would then have to vote to make the documents public and report them to the full House. If the Treasury Department completely blocked the release of the records, "that would be illegal," said David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and expert on Trump and tax law. "The reason that would be illegal is that the statute says that they 'shall' produce the returns. It's not 'may' or 'can' or something else. It is a mandatory act," he said. "Unless they get the most extraordinary partisan judge, then what will happen at the end of the day is very clear: They'll have to turn them over." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the San Francisco Chronicle in early October that demanding the president's tax returns "is one of the first things we'd do — that's the easiest thing in the world. That’s nothing." Last week, Pelosi said that she'd leave it up to the committees themselves to decide. Trump, however, has already signaled that he's not interested in playing ball. If he's investigated, he said at a press conference Wednesday, hours after Democrats claimed their House majority, then Democrats could find themselves getting investigated right back, by Senate Republicans. What's more, he added: policy deals could be off the table. "If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt, and I would blame them, because they now are going to be coming up with policy," he said. Democrats will also have the subpoena power in their arsenal — and, based on their efforts in this congressional term, they're itching to use it. During Trump's presidency so far, congressional Republicans have blocked more than 52 subpoena requests by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, including requests for documents related to everything from alleged housing abuses by the company run by presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner's family to the Justice Department's refusal to defend Obamacare in court. But just because they can now issue subpoenas doesn't mean they necessarily will issue as many as some voters may expect — or that they can count on getting the information they're looking for anytime soon. "Subpoena power is interesting," Pelosi said at a recent CNN event. "To use it, or not to use it? It's a great arrow to have in your quiver in terms of negotiating on other subjects. But getting back to what we will do, what we will do is exercise oversight, which is the responsibility of the Congress of the United States, exercise oversight over the agencies of government, which this administration has completely walked away from." Laurence Tribe, constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, cautioned this week that the subpoena power wasn't a magical one. "Hate to say it, but counting on a Democratic House's subpoenas to unlock all the secrets of this corrupt administration could prove naïve," he tweeted. "A Trumpified judiciary, expanded further with the Senate's acquiescence, might let the Trumpsters stonewall. So democracy remains endangered." After Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they issued subpoenas to the Obama administration on Operation Fast and Furious in which for two years, a branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed illegal gun sales in order to track sellers and purchasers. "The White House tried to ignore our subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. We took them to court and won," said Kurt Bardella, who served as deputy communications director and senior adviser to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., when he led the Oversight Committee. But the road to a final victory was a long time coming. The House started investigating the operation as soon as Republicans assumed the majority in 2011, ahead of President Barack Obama's re-election bid — but despite apparent judicial wins, were still battling the Justice Department over documents long after Obama had left office. The DOJ seemed to finally reach a settlement in 2018 — only to see that potential agreement thrown into question last month. And ironically, the Republican fight for Obama-era documents may have left Trump with fewer legal options in his own fight to keep documents from opposition investigators. If he opts to try, beyond legal issues, there can be political risks to stonewalling subpoenas. "(Trump) will look like he is trying to hide something that he shouldn't be. He will be entering into unprecedented separation of powers territory," added Bardella. "We use to say at Oversight, it's not the crime, it's the cover-up that gets you. By refusing to comply with the legislative branch's constitutionally protected oversight authority, Trump could do himself even more harm than the actual investigations would produce." That is, if he were inclined to second-guess a politically risky maneuver. Some Democratic members of Congress have floated the idea of impeaching Trump. But most haven't — including the party's leaders. In an NBC News Exit Poll, a majority of Tuesday voters — 54 percent — said that they don't think Trump should be impeached, while 41 percent said that they think he should. Pelosi herself suggested in an interview with PBS NewsHour that aired on election night that impeachment won't be her focus — for now. "It depends on what happens in the Mueller investigation," she said. “But (impeachment) is not unifying. And I get criticized in my own party for not being more supportive, but I'm not. If that happens, that would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be so conclusive." By introducing a seemingly impossible standard — bipartisan impeachment buy-in in a bitterly divided Washington — it might appear Pelosi was effectively ruling out the idea. She's been at pains to stress: she hasn't. "Recognize one point," Pelosi told The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere Friday after the election. "What Mueller might not think is indictable could be impeachable." In the wake of the election this week, many Democrats said that any discussion of the "I-word" is premature. "I haven't seen any evidence yet that would raise that, so it seems like you're skipping a few steps there," Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., said on CNN. "There's a special counsel who's looking at the whole problem. We need to give him the time and space to do his job, and at any time that he finishes and presents us with his conclusions, we'll make a decision at that point." Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., told MSNBC that she’s not interested in impeaching the president. "You know, I don't think that’s the way forward." "My sense was that health care was on the ballot and not impeachment. We should lead with the reasons the voters gave us the majority," Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, told NBC News on Thursday. "But we shouldn't look the other way. If there's a line of evidence to pursue, we should pursue it and do it responsibly and put together an impenetrable case that could receive bipartisan support." And as Hill Democrats are quick to point out, the odds of a Republican Senate voting overwhelmingly to remove a Republican president impeached by a Democratic House currently lie somewhere between slim and none. Meanwhile, as the Senate's GOP leader pointed out last week, his party paid a steep political price two decades ago for ignoring the partisan headwinds surrounding their decision to impeach a president. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned House Democrats Wednesday that any Trump investigations under their new majority over the next two years "might not be a smart strategy." "The whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting. I remember when we tried it in the late '90s," he told reporters. "We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down."

---split---18.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/donald-trumps-trans-atlantic-tweetstorm-air-force-one---split---President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump step off Air Force One on Oct. 30 in Pittsburgh. On Friday, the president fired off a number of tweets from the plane while traveling with his wife to Paris. (Shealah Craighead/White House via Flickr) President Donald Trump assured reporters as he left the White House Friday morning for Paris he was “thinking about the world.” Only, he wasn’t. The president and first lady Melania Trump boarded Marine One just before 9:30 a.m. and lifted off to link up with Air Force One a few minutes later. By 10 a.m., the executive jet was wheels up for a diplomatic trip to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. Before the roughly six-hour flight to Paris, any global focus of the diplomat in chief appeared to have been discarded on the South Lawn, where he took a list of questions from reporters on his way out. [Three Things to Watch When Trump, Putin Land in Paris] “I haven’t ruled out anything. I haven’t even thought about it,” he said when asked if he intends to sit down with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “I'm thinking about the world. Right now, I'm thinking about the world. I’m not thinking about sit-downs or not sit-downs. There was no collusion. It’s a whole hoax.” “This was a thing set up by the Democrats, just like they set up other things. When you look at what’s going on Florida, when you look at what’s going on in lots of different locations,” the president continued, apparently referring to the contested Sunshine State Senate race where Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson trails GOP Gov. Rick Scott with a recount looming. Watch: Trump Says He Doesn’t Know Matt Whitaker Before Air Force One had made much progress crossing the Atlantic, Trump’s worldly thoughts had given way to an hourslong trans-Atlantic Twitter rant about exclusively domestic topics, including his political foes. Other world leaders he will see in Paris, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, were not mentioned. He started with the too-close-to-call Georgia governor’s race, where GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp is leading Democrat Stacey Abrams by under 2 points. Kemp has declared victory, though The Associated Press has not yet called the race. The president at 10:55 a.m. wrote that Kemp “won,” declaring, “It is time to move on!” Abrams’ campaign, however, has other plans. .@BrianKempGA ran a great race in Georgia – he won. It is time to move on!  Three minutes later, the tweeter in chief expressed doubts about the vote counts in both Southern states. “You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday” he wrote, predicting Democrats would blame both situations on Russian interference and “demand an immediate apology from President Putin!” About an hour later, he was back at it, warning Democrats in Florida that he would be sending “much better lawyers” to oversee the recount. He accused them of “FRAUD!” and blasted what he called “their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias.” You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!   As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don’t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!  Notably, Fox News ran several segments discussing both contested races around the time of Trump’s tweets. Journalists who travel with the president on Air Force One have regularly noted that its television monitors, including one in Trump’s private office, are tuned to that network. And Trump often comments on Fox News shows that he watches regularly. At his final midterms rally in Missouri late Monday night, Trump did not hide his affection for Fox News and its on-air personalities. He called both Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro onstage to make remarks. “Do we love Sean, by the way? … There is nobody like this man,” Trump told his supporters about the longtime host. “Although he’s tough, he’s tough. But, boy, I’ll tell you what, when he’s on your side, there’s nobody you want better.” Of Pirro, he said: “Jeanine has been a great, great friend to all of us. You know that.” As Air Force One got closer to Europe, the passenger in chief would return to the Florida race, which he likely feels invested in after several trips to stump for and praise Scott. But he took a break to attack outgoing GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, accusing the Arizona Republican of putting his own possible presidential ambitions ahead of actually protecting the Mueller investigation. He even hit him with one of his signature derisive nicknames: “Flake(y).” Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the “crime” of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!  The GOP president, whose base is mostly white and conservative and who is hammered regularly by critics for spouting racial “dog whistles,” mused just after 12:30 p.m. Eastern time about vote-counting issues in Florida’s Broward County. Never reluctant to espouse conspiracy theories, Trump wrote, “How come they never find Republican votes?” — referring to what he called the “Broward Effect.” Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they “found” many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. “The Broward Effect.” How come they never find Republican votes?  To find one answer, Trump could have had his staff seek out U.S. Census Bureau and Florida Department of State data about Broward’s demographics. For instance, the bureau found the county’s population is 64 percent white — but African-Americans and Latinos combine for 60 percent of residents. Both those groups largely vote Democratic. And the state office’s website says Broward has 249,822 registered Republicans and 586,833 registered Democrats. [The ‘Open-Book’ President Lays Out His ‘War-Like Posture’ Plan] By 1:20 p.m., Trump was comparing Florida’s governor race — where Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum initially conceded to former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis before the margin became small enough to trigger a recount — to his 2016 presidential win in the state. He accused, without providing evidence, Broward officials of being “ready to do a ‘number’ on him only to be foiled when he clinched that state before they — allegedly — could. Broward County officials are sharply rejecting any notion of fraud or other shenanigans. Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him “back into play.” Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he’s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!   In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a “number,” couldn’t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!  About 20 minutes later, Trump thanked a former campaign-trail foe, Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, for “helping to expose the potential corruption” and “Election Theft.” He ended that one with a warning to the state’s Democratic officials: “The WORLD is now watching closely!” Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. The WORLD is now watching closely!  It took nearly four hours, but his focus — at least for the time it took to fire off one tweet — was back on the world. Barbara Perry of the University of Virginia’s Miller Center recently said that Trump’s use of his preferred social media platform — despite what one might think of the content of his posts — are as effective as radio and television were for some American political giants. “Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and FDR were all presidents who were masters of the media of their day,” she said. “But Trump is the master with his Twitter and the bullying style and just precipitating crises du jour it seems like every day. … He sets the narrative, the agenda every single day.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---21.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-claims-no-mueller-probe-chats-acting-ag-whitaker---split---President Donald Trump says he has never discussed the Russia investigation with Acting Attorny General Matthew Whitaker. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) President Donald Trump on Friday claimed he has never discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russia’s 2016 election meddling and possible coordination with his campaign with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. “I didn’t speak to Matt Whitaker” about the ongoing Justice Department probe before naming him to the post, Trump said. It remains unclear whether the president knew about Whitaker’s past critical comments about the probe before he fired Jeff Sessions as the country’s top attorney and law enforcement official and replaced him, for now, with Sessions’ chief of staff. Democratic lawmakers are warning that Trump’s removal of Sessions is a move against Mueller, and they say that would trigger a constitutional crisis. Trump Says He Doesn't Know Matt Whitaker Should Trump consider the acting AG as his nominee to replace Sessions permanently, Whitaker’s Mueller probe views could hinder a potential nomination, since a few moderate Republican senators support allowing the special counsel to finish his work. “It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump’s finances or his family’s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,” Whitaker wrote in a 2017 CNN op-ed. “I don’t know Whitaker,” Trump claimed on the White House’s South Lawn as he left for a weekend visit to Paris for World War I Armistice Day commemoration festivities. But the Justice Department chief of staff had filled in for Sessions at high-level meetings, so Trump does have some familiarity with him. He did say Whitaker, who served as a U.S. attorney during the George W. Bush administration, is “highly thought of.” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has clashed with Trump, had been overseeing Mueller’s work because Sessions recused himself. Rosenstein, who recently mended fences with the president, was passed over for the acting AG position and has given up day-to-day management of the special counsel probe. Several senior White House aides said Trump wants him to focus on the deputy’s typical role overseeing the department’s daily operations. Trump appeared confused about Justice Department guidelines for establishing a special counsel, saying Mueller was not confirmed by the Senate because he had too many “conflicts.” He was confirmed by the body when he served as FBI director, however. “This only comes up because anyone who works for me, they do a number on them,” Trump said of the media and his critics. “You didn’t have any problems with Matt Whitaker when he worked for Jeff Sessions.” Trump said he “could have brought in somebody from the outside” to be acting AG, “but I didn’t want to do that.” Several times, he called Whitaker “a very strong personality — I think that’s what they need.” The president downplayed the significance of Whitaker’s past remarks about the Mueller probe, saying many individuals who are qualified for such roles opine in the media. If that is a disqualifying thing, “you’d have nobody left to choose.” Democratic lawmakers and some legal experts have called on Whitaker, based on the CNN op-ed and other media comments about the probe, to recuse himself like Sessions did. So far, the acting AG has shown no intention of doing so. The president confirmed that outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, mentioned as a potential AG nominee, was at the White House on Thursday. “But I didn’t speak to him,” Trump said. Meanwhile, as Florida’s contested Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott heads into a legal battle, Trump said there “could be” a federal role in a recount there. After Scott on Thursday night accused Democrats of fraud and trying to steal the election, the GOP president said, “We won easily.” Trump accused Broward County officials with “finding votes out of nowhere,” urging Floridians and Americans to “look at it very, very cautiously.” The president also railed against CNN’s Jim Acosta two days after his White House press pass was confiscated following a verbal altercation with Trump during a news conference. And he called American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan “a loser” and “nasty” after she tried to ask a question that day without being called on. “You’ve got to treat the White House and the office of the presidency with respect.” Amid warnings from free press advocates to limit the banning of reporters to Acosta, Trump said this of how long the CNN reporter would be banned and about confiscating other journalists’ White House press passes: “I haven’t made that decision. But it could be others also.” Trump fielded a few other questions before departing. Despite saying he would name a nominee to replace Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations before he left for Paris, Trump said he will pick a nominee “in the next couple of weeks.” Asked about his vow to sign an executive order that would attempt to end birthright citizenship, he said it got delayed by other things but he still intends to do so. If and when that happens, an immediate legal challenge is expected.

---split---32.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/us/politics/ivanka-trump-africa-trip.html---split---Supported by By Maggie Haberman and Katie Rogers WASHINGTON — When Melania Trump’s chief of staff announced at a staff meeting months ago that the first lady would be traveling to Africa for her first solo journey abroad, aides to Ivanka Trump, her stepdaughter, sent back a message: She was planning her own trip to Africa but just hadn’t announced it yet. Mrs. Trump spent five days last month in Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt, a trip that generated mostly positive coverage, topped off with a glossy network special. And soon the president’s eldest daughter and senior adviser will follow suit, traveling to Africa with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the president’s most loyal defenders. Stepmother and stepdaughter have given different reasons for their interest in the continent, which Mr. Trump, who famously used an expletive to describe African countries, has yet to visit. Melania Trump used her trip to highlight poverty and her “Be Best” initiative, while Ivanka Trump’s trip, tentatively scheduled for January, will showcase her role as an informal White House liaison with members of Congress and her interest in economic empowerment. But the competing visits also suggest the delicate balance the White House staff faces in managing the activities of both the first lady and the senior adviser to the president who has embraced the title of first daughter. By all accounts, the two women have a complicated dynamic, and they coexist with little overlap in their roles. But they have not hosted a joint initiative carried out solely between their staffs since Mrs. Trump moved full time to the White House last year after spending the first months of her husband’s administration with her son in New York. They have rarely appeared together. And they clearly see their roles differently. Melania Trump, 48, prefers to stay deeply private. Ivanka Trump, 37, has sought from the earliest days of the Trump administration to define her role as an adviser and policy maker, staking out a claim to an office in the West Wing, where the president and his staff are, after early reports of a Trump family office potentially being set up in the East Wing, the traditional domain of the first lady. And while expanding her own presence in the White House, Ms. Trump has at times, intentionally or not, defined her stepmother’s role in more limited terms. Friends say she has noticeably bristled when asked questions that she saw as traditionally in line with a first lady’s responsibilities — among friends, she has dismissed queries about whether she would be involved in White House preservation efforts, and has made it clear that she was in the White House to work on meaty policy issues, a move some allies say was out of deference to Melania Trump. Daughter and wife both have influence with the president but they exercise it differently. Earlier this year, the first lady, who has made it a point to say she is willing to disagree with her husband, spoke publicly about her discomfort with the administration’s policy of separating children from their parents after illegal border crossings — and made several trips to the area. Ivanka Trump also weighed in on the issue, but that only became known when Mr. Trump told a group of congressional Republicans that his daughter had been urging him to change the policy. Historians have struggled to place the relationship between the two women in context. Katherine Jellison, a professor at Ohio University who studies first ladies, said there was little historical precedent for an adult first daughter and first lady to overlap to this degree. The closest parallel, she said, would be between Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt. “Both had a great deal of influence on F.D.R.,” Ms. Jellison said. “In the case of Melania and Ivanka Trump, on the other hand, sometimes one of them is ‘out front,’ and sometimes it’s the other one who is,” she added. As her role has evolved, Ivanka Trump has let family friends know in the clearest terms that she is in the White House to help her father by using her charm and contacts to cut through Washington’s bureaucracy, particularly with Congress. Sometimes she has emphasized her official role on the White House staff during West Wing controversies, other times that of being the president’s daughter. Like her father, Ms. Trump is acutely aware of her news coverage: A rotating cast of White House aides have often tried to get her credit in the news media for issues she has worked on. Her meetings are often summarized by the White House press office and emailed to reporters, a move that is not routinely extended to other senior advisers to Mr. Trump. Ms. Trump has also campaigned with her father, turning up to speak at a rally the night before the midterm elections in Fort Wayne, Ind., and she has sometimes served as a surrogate. The first lady, for her part, has made clear she dislikes politics, and was largely absent from the campaign trail during the midterms. Ivanka Trump’s interest in politics had led her to forge alliances with moderate Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, as well as with newly minted Trump confidants like Mr. Graham. “If Mrs. Trump is going to focus on other things,” said Anita McBride, the former chief of staff to the first lady Laura Bush, “this is a place where Ivanka Trump can be helpful. Frankly, the president’s going to need her to do that more now than he probably ever did.” Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, did not directly address the relationship between first lady and first daughter. “The office of the first lady is focused on her initiatives and works independently,” Ms. Grisham said in a statement, “but we often collaborate on a variety of projects with the West Wing and have a very positive working relationship.” A White House official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity insisted that there was no tension between the two: “The first lady and Ivanka have a great relationship. As strong independent women, each has their own unique portfolio but they always support each another personally and professionally.” And a person close to Ivanka Trump insisted she was trying to avoid stepping on her stepmother’s toes when she described certain duties as being in the East Wing’s purview. Yet the sensitivities over Mrs. Trump’s Africa trip suggested that the aides are acutely conscious of possible problems. The first lady’s office had asked West Wing officials to give her some space while she was in Africa so she could showcase the work she was doing, according to two people briefed on the discussion. There were widely distributed photographs of Mrs. Trump at several of the stops, including Accra, Ghana, where she was pictured cradling a small child. But two days later, Ivanka Trump posted on her Instagram feed a video filmed by the White House team that had a final image of her with a black child during a tour of storm-struck North Carolina. Someone in the West Wing noticed it, and flagged it for the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who has privately described the Trump children as “playing government” and who was supposed to help manage the relationship between the two women’s offices, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Mr. Kelly discussed the video with Ms. Trump’s staff, according to two people familiar with the talks. A White House official disputed that Mr. Kelly had such a discussion. As for Ivanka Trump’s pending trip to Africa, White House aides said that Mr. Graham first invited her several months ago, but she had rescheduled it to accommodate the first lady’s and one taken by the secretary of state. People familiar with the trip said that Bill Shine, the White House communications director, has been helping shape coverage of the visit. Like the first lady’s, it may also include a network special.     Advertisement
---split---33.0---split---http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  Global Attitudes & Trends Most still want U.S. as top global power, but see China on the rise By Richard Wike, Bruce Stokes, Jacob Poushter, Laura Silver, Janell Fetterolf and Kat Devlin America’s global image plummeted following the election of President Donald Trump, amid widespread opposition to his administration’s policies and a widely shared lack of confidence in his leadership. Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election approaches, a new 25-nation Pew Research Center survey finds that Trump’s international image remains poor, while ratings for the United States are much lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency. The poll also finds that international publics express significant concerns about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it used to. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well, including the fact that, while the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago. Even though America’s image has declined since Trump’s election, on balance the U.S. still receives positive marks – across the 25 nations polled, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% offer an unfavorable rating. However, a median of only 27% say they have confidence in President Trump to do the right thing in world affairs; 70% lack confidence in him. Frustrations with the U.S. in the Trump era are particularly common among some of America’s closest allies and partners. In Germany, where just 10% have confidence in Trump, three-in-four people say the U.S. is doing less these days to address global problems, and the share of the public who believe the U.S. respects personal freedoms is down 35 percentage points since 2008. In France, only 9% have confidence in Trump, while 81% think the U.S. doesn’t consider the interests of countries like France when making foreign policy decisions. Critical views are also widespread among America’s closest neighbors. Only 25% of Canadians rate Trump positively, more than six-in-ten (63%) say the U.S. is doing less than in the past to address global problems, and 82% think the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making policy. Meanwhile, Trump’s lowest ratings on the survey are found in Mexico, where just 6% express confidence in his leadership. One exception to this pattern is Israel. After a year in which the Trump administration generated international controversy by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, his positive rating jumped to 69%, up from 56% in 2017. Around the world, publics are divided about the direction of American power: Across the 25 nations surveyed, a median of 31% say the U.S. plays a more important role in the world today than it did ten years ago; 25% say it plays a less important role; and 35% believe the U.S. is as important as it was a decade ago. In contrast, views about Chinese power are clear: A median of 70% say China’s role on the world stage has grown over the past 10 years. Still, by a slim margin, more people name the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power (a median of 39% say the U.S., 34% say China). And despite the unease many feel about the U.S. at the moment, the idea of a U.S.-led world order is still attractive to most. When asked which would be better for the world, having China or the U.S. as the top global power, people in nearly every country tend to select the U.S., and this is particularly common among some of China’s Asia-Pacific neighbors, such as Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Australia. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to Aug. 12, 2018. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 use additional data from a Pew Research Center survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted from May 14 to June 15, 2018. Although perceptions of the U.S. are on balance positive, they vary considerably among the nations surveyed. Ten of the 25 countries in this year’s survey are European Union member states, and across these EU nations a median of just 43% offer a favorable opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, majorities in four of the five Asia-Pacific nations polled give the U.S. a positive rating, including 83% in the Philippines, one of the highest ratings in the survey. The U.S. also gets high marks in South Korea, where 80% have a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in President Trump has increased over the past year from 17% to 44%. As has largely been the case since Pew Research Center’s first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, attitudes toward the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa are largely positive, with Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans expressing mostly favorable opinions in this year’s poll. The three Latin American nations polled offer differing views about the U.S., with Brazilians voicing mostly favorable reviews, while Argentines and Mexicans are mostly negative. And the two Middle Eastern nations in the study – Israel and Tunisia – offer strikingly different assessments. The country giving the U.S. its lowest rating in the survey, and the place where the biggest drop in U.S. favorability has taken place over the past year, is Russia. Just 26% of Russians have a favorable opinion of the U.S., compared with 41% in 2017. A 55% majority of Russians say relations have gotten worse in the past year, and the share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53% to 19%. The survey examined attitudes toward five world leaders, and overall Donald Trump receives the most negative ratings among the five. A median of 70% across the 25 nations polled lack confidence in the American leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping also receive mostly negative reviews. In contrast, opinions about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are generally positive. Both leaders are mostly popular in the EU, although there are regional divides within Europe, with Merkel and Macron receiving favorable ratings in the Northern European nations surveyed and less stellar reviews in Eastern and Southern Europe. European attitudes toward Trump are strikingly negative, especially when compared with the ratings his predecessor received while in office. Looking at four European nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently since 2003 reveals a clear pattern regarding perceptions of American presidents. George W. Bush, whose foreign policies were broadly unpopular in Europe, got low ratings during his presidency, while the opposite was true for Barack Obama, who enjoyed strong approval in these four nations during his time in office. Following the 2016 election, confidence in the president plunged, with Trump’s ratings resembling what Bush received near the end of his second term (although Trump’s numbers are up slightly in the United Kingdom this year). In several European nations, Trump receives higher ratings from supporters of right-wing populist parties. For example, among people in the UK who have a favorable view of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), 53% express confidence in Trump, compared with only 21% among those with an unfavorable view of UKIP. Similar divides exist among supporters and detractors of right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. However, it is worth noting that, other than in the UK, there is no European country in which more than half of right-wing populist party supporters say they have confidence in Trump. A common criticism about American foreign policy over the past decade and a half has been that the U.S. only looks after its own interests in world affairs, ignoring the interests of other nations. As Pew Research Center surveys showed, this belief was especially prevalent during George W. Bush’s presidency, when many around the world thought the U.S. was pursuing unilateralist, and unpopular, policies. Strong opposition to the Iraq War and other elements of Bush’s foreign policy led to rising complaints about the U.S. acting alone and ignoring the interests and concerns of other nations. Opinions shifted following Barack Obama’s election, with more people saying the U.S. considers their country’s interest, although even during the Obama years the prevailing global sentiment was that the U.S. doesn’t necessarily consider other countries. Now, the Trump presidency has brought an increase in the number of people in many nations saying the U.S. essentially doesn’t listen to countries like theirs when making foreign policy. This pattern is especially pronounced among some of America’s top allies and partners. For instance, while the share of the French public who believe the U.S. considers their national interest has not been very high at any point over the past decade and a half, it reached a low point near the end of Bush’s second term (11% in 2007), rose somewhat during Obama’s presidency (35% in 2013) and has declined once more under Trump. Today, just 18% in France say the U.S. considers the interests of countries like theirs when making policy. America’s reputation as a defender of individual liberty has generally been strong in Pew Research Center surveys since we first started asking about it in 2008. The prevailing view among the publics surveyed has typically been that the U.S. government respects the personal liberties of its people, and that is true again in this year’s poll. However, this opinion has become less common over time, and the decline has been particularly sharp among key U.S. partners in Europe, North America and Asia. The decline began during the Obama administration following revelations about the National Security Agency’s electronic eavesdropping on communications around the world, and it has continued during the first two years of the Trump presidency. The drop is especially prominent in Western Europe, where the share of the public saying Washington respects personal freedom has declined sharply since 2013. The same pattern is found among several other U.S. allies as well, including Canada, where the percentage saying the U.S. respects individual freedom has dropped from 75% to 38% since 2013, and Australia, where it has gone from 72% to 45%. Respondents to the survey were read a list of seven major nations, and for each one, were asked whether they think it is playing a more important, less important, or as important of a role in the world compared with 10 years ago. Among the seven countries tested, China stands apart: A median of 70% across the nations polled say Beijing plays a more important role today than a decade ago. Half or more in 23 of 25 countries express this view. Many also say this about Russia. A median of 41% believe Moscow’s role on the world stage has grown over the past decade, and majorities hold this view in Greece, Israel, Tunisia and Russia itself. Overall, people are split on whether Germany’s role is greater than it was 10 years ago or about the same, but many in Europe see Germany’s role as more influential. On the other hand, Europeans are particularly likely to think the UK is less important now. There is no real consensus in views of America’s prominence in world affairs. A median of 35% believe it is as important as it was 10 years ago, while 31% say it is more important and 25% say less. Japan is the only country with a majority saying that Washington plays a less important role. Meanwhile, Israelis, Nigerians and Kenyans are particularly likely to think the U.S. is more important than it used to be. In addition to being asked about whether major powers are rising, falling or staying about the same, respondents were asked the following question about whether they would prefer the U.S. or China to be the top global power: “Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world: the U.S. is the world’s leading power or China is the world’s leading power?” Results show that the U.S. is overwhelmingly the top choice. The U.S. is named more often than China in every country surveyed except three: Argentina, Tunisia and Russia, although in many nations significant numbers volunteer that it would be good for the world if both or neither were the leading power. Some of America’s allies in Asia and elsewhere are particularly likely to prefer a future in which the U.S. is the top global power. Two-thirds or more hold this opinion in Japan, the Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK.  Findings from Germany, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Israel illustrate key patterns and major differences in how foreign publics view the U.S. in 2018. Germany stands out as a country where America’s image is considerably more negative today than during the Barack Obama era. Whereas Obama was extremely popular in Germany (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA scandal), only around one-in-ten Germans have voiced confidence in Trump in each of the past two years, ratings similar to those registered for George W. Bush at the end of his second term. Germany stands out on other measures as well. It is the country with the highest percentage (80%) saying relations with the U.S. have deteriorated over the past year, and it is tied with Sweden for the largest share of the public (75%) saying the U.S. is doing less to confront global problems. Germany is also where the biggest declines have taken place in recent years regarding the belief that the U.S. respects personal freedom and that Washington listens to other countries in international affairs. Mexico is where Trump gets his lowest ratings on the survey: Just 6% in the United States’ southern neighbor have confidence in him. Last year, more than nine-in-ten Mexicans opposed Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year, 66% in Mexico say relations have gotten worse over the past 12 months. Just 39% of Canadians express a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2018, the lowest percentage since Pew Research Center began polling in Canada in 2002. Only 25% have confidence in Trump, although he gets more positive ratings among those who feel closest to the Conservative Party (44%) than among those who identify with the New Democratic Party (17%) or the ruling Liberal Party (10%). Fully 82% say the U.S. ignores Canada’s interests when making foreign policy. Japanese trust in the U.S. president has also suffered under Donald Trump, but America’s overall image has not. In 2018, just three-in-ten Japanese say they have confidence in Trump’s handling of world affairs, a slight improvement over their view in 2017, but significantly lower than their views of the U.S. president throughout the Obama administration. Opinion of Trump is comparable to sentiment about George W. Bush during his time in office. Fully 67% of Japanese, however, have a favorable view of the U.S., up 10 percentage points from last year. Despite the high ratings for the U.S., there are concerns in Japan about the trajectory of American power – it is the only country where a majority (55%) believes the U.S. is less powerful than 10 years ago. Confidence in President Trump has increased significantly in Israel since 2017. Trump also receives substantially higher ratings than Obama got near the end of his second term, although they are very similar to the high ratings for Obama in 2014, before tensions rose between his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. As has been the case in recent years, around eight-in-ten Israelis express a favorable opinion about the U.S. At 52%, Israelis are more likely than any other public surveyed to say the U.S. is doing more to address global problems than a few years ago. Israel also tops the list in terms of the share of the public (79%) saying that relations with the U.S. have improved in the past year. The rest of the report delves into these and other findings in more detail. Chapter 1 explores overall attitudes toward the U.S., America’s approach to foreign policy, whether the U.S. government respects individual liberty, and relations between survey countries and the U.S. Chapter 2 examines ratings for President Trump and other world leaders. Chapter 3 looks at opinions regarding whether specific major nations are playing a more or less important role in world affairs than in the past. Chapter 4 explores views about the balance of power between the U.S. and China, while Chapter 5 examines China’s global image.  Use the tool below to explore how individual countries view the U.S. and its president, and how these views have changed over time. Keep in mind that surveys are not conducted in every country for every year. But the patterns over time should be clear, since this interactive includes all available data for the 25 countries on these two questions.

In fact, the home is in Lakeside, Calif. In the original broadcast of this game, we said, "It's a genuine Veg-O-Matic from Ron Popeil, donated by his daughter after his death." Ron Popeil is not dead. The Veg-O-Matic is from inventor Samuel Popeil – Samuel's daughter Lisa donated the Veg-O-Matic after her father's death. Samuel Popeil's son, Ron Popeil, who founded Ronco Inventions and popularly marketed the device, is still alive.

His story asserted that Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to be the next CIA director, played a role in the treatment of al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah during interrogations at a "black site" in Thailand and that she had "mocked" Zubaydah. On March 15, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology. Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment. During this report, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded. She did run that site for a time after the Sept. 11 attacks, but as ProPublica has now acknowledged in a retraction of its reporting, she was not there when Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Two House Democrats subsequently alleged that Zinke used federal dollars to promote Saccone's candidacy; they called for an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which handles ethics cases.

In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.
