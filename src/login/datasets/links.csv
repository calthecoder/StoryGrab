Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a not-so-subtle swipe at Howard Schultz after the ex-Starbucks CEO said he's mulling an independent presidential bid, issuing a statement Monday saying there is “no way an independent can win.” Democratic Senator Kamala Harris' 'bloviating' does not comport with how Americans are feeling, says RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany.
