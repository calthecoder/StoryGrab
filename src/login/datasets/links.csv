---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/georgia-voting-machine-issues-heighten-scrutiny-brian-kemp/---split---If former state representative Stacey Abrams wins the race for governor of Georgia, she would be the US’s first black woman governor. She’s running in a tightly contested race against sitting secretary of state Brian Kemp, who in his official capacity as overseer of Georgia’s voter rolls has fought hard the past few months to remove people from the active voter lists who might be inclined to vote for Abrams. He’s been accused of targeting black voters specifically, purging them from voter rolls. Black people make up 30.2 percent of Georgia’s population, according to the US Census. Many have said Kemp should have stepped down as secretary of state, citing a conflict of interest between his role as the guardian of the vote and as a candidate on the ballot. New questions around Kemp’s oversight of the election flared Tuesday amid problems with voting in some parts of the state. Late Tuesday, a group of Georgian voters filed a lawsuit requesting an injunction to prevent Kemp from overseeing the vote count, writing that they have "reasonable belief that Kemp will not be a fair judge of the outcome of the elections and will exercise his official duties in a biased manner that denies them the right to cast an effective vote." The plaintiffs request someone new be appointed to certify the outcome of the vote.1 Even before the lawsuit, and in addition to worries about bias, Kemp's dual role as candidate and election official was a cause for concern. “We have a secretary of state who is running for governor who hasn’t been there for four months to run things,” says Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a nonpartisan grassroots organization. Henderson is working with 150 people across Georgia Tuesday. “He's left it up the elections supervisor Chris Harvey, and they have a very small team of folks, it’s only eight people.” Wait times to vote in some areas Tuesday were averaging three hours, a representative for Verified Voting, a nonpartisan organization devoted to voting security, told WIRED. This was owing both to problems at polling places and higher than expected turnout, according to Henderson. At one polling place in Snellville, in Gwinnett County, north of Atlanta, people were unable to vote for hours because there were no power cords for the machines when the polls opened, according to NBC News. Snellville’s population includes a higher percentage of blacks, 36 percent versus 29 percent than the county overall. “What we are seeing would back up the theory that voter intimidation and disenfranchisement is occurring in low income minority communities across the state,” says Henderson. “We've had the most reports of problems from areas that are densely populated with minorities.” Her team has gotten reports from numerous counties that they’ve run out of ballots, or don’t have enough provisional ballots. She says counties have been “consistently underfunded” and offered little communication. County election officials are relying on news reports to understand how many ballots to prepare, and what is going on with lines and machine malfunctions, she says. The lack of preparation and accurate information at the polls is leading to what Henderson calls voter intimidation from poll workers who wrongly turn people away. “We've had reports of voters being completely turned away without even being given a provisional ballot,” Henderson says. “Sixty students at Albany State University this morning were turned away completely and we can’t figure out why. We have an attorney on the ground who is trying to figure out how to get the students back to the polls.” More than 53,000 voters in Georgia were purged from the voter rolls owing to a strict “signature matching” rule that requires voters’ registration signature to exactly match their DMV signature. These people have moved to a “pending registration list.” These pending registrants are supposed to be allowed to vote. Kemp has said that if people present ID, they will be allowed to vote. Trouble is, according to Henderson, poll workers don’t necessarily know or understand this. The pending list is separate from the electronic registration list that poll workers are trained to use. Poll workers need to know to check that list, and they need to know that if a name appears on the list that person is allowed to vote. In some cases, she says, poll workers don’t know about the pending list, and voters don’t know to ask poll workers to check it. Georgia is also one of only five states in the nation that doesn’t provide paper ballot backups for its electronic touchscreen machines, according to Verified Voting, so when things go wrong—as they are today—it’s impossible to conduct a full audit. Some machines that generate needed “smart cards” for voting were not working properly in Georgia Tuesday. Trouble with misinformed poll workers, lack of ballots and missing power cords aren’t the only problems plaguing Georgia’s election. Georgia voters have been inundated with misleading robocalls from Kemp falsely claiming that Abrams wants to let undocumented immigrants vote. His supporters are also falsely suggesting that armed Black Panthers are intimidating white voters at the polls. Over the weekend, Kemp accused the Democratic Party of attempting to hack the state’s voter-registration system, without citing evidence. On Monday, Kemp, who is white, engaged in racial fear-mongering, tweeting that “The Black Panther Party is backing my opponent. RT if you think Abrams is TOO EXTREME for Georgia!” The tweet linked to a Breitbart article, which took an image, posted to Facebook by a group identifying itself as The New Black Panther Party, of a small “armed rally against voter disenfranchisement” held on November 3. The Breitbart article compares that rally, which appeared to have no more than five Black Panthers in attendance based on a review of 22 photos the group put on Facebook, to the 1,000-person-plus rally Trump held for Kemp the next night. Kemp’s supporters are using the same images to claim that Black Panthers are intimidating voters at the polls. One post shared in a Facebook group called Trump Train, which has more than 54,000 members, urged people to call police if they saw Black Panthers at the polls: “Black Panthers, a radicalized-racist militant group, are armed with assult weapons roaming the streets and neighborhoods as well as the voting polls in Georgia to intimidate and 'persuade' Voters to vote for the far-left democrat candidate, Stacey Abrams for Governor.” The New Black Panthers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There have been some reports of racially motivated voter intimidation outside polling places on Tuesday. Henderson says she and her team have gotten a few reports of people with megaphones shouting anti-black racial slurs outside certain polling places, though she declined to name the counties. Police, she say, have had to get involved in some instances. The secretary of state’s office has issued no official warnings about voter intimidation or problems at the polls and did not respond to a request for comment.

New poll shows people view the economy as good or excellent under President Trump. On 'Your World,' Tim Hockey says retail clients are buying into the dips of the market. Many years ago, Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving – was considered the official start of the holiday shopping season. Now, the first day of November is the true start of the holiday shopping season. America's economy is booming because President Trump has reversed failed Obama policies. The Dow suffered its worst monthly percentage drop since 2016, the S&P 500 had its worst month since 2011 and the Nasdaq saw its biggest percentage decline since 2008. Federal prosecutors say Chinese intelligence officers and hackers working for them have been charged with commercial espionage that included trying to steal information on commercial jet engines. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader. The U.S. economy grew at 3.5 percent between July and September, a faster pace than expected pace; the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 added to their October losses on Friday.

In some ways, the elections are a referendum on where Americans stand with regard to the rule of law, sovereignty and respect. An immigration board has rejected an appeal from a Spanish-language news outlet reporter who was arrested during a demonstration in Tennessee. Today is the day, as you well know, of the midterm elections and the noise levels are becoming almost unbearable.

A Texas man is accused of firing a gun at illegal immigrants who he says trespassed on his property last week, The Monitor reported. In an apparent bid to bypass the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and seek an immediate resolution to its effort to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Trump administration on Monday made the unusual decision to ask the Supreme Court to take over three pending lawsuits opposing the president's plan that are making their way through the lower courts.

Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced the end of the U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, as the administration restored a network of sanctions on the regime. Rich Edson explains on 'Special Report.' The Trump administration said it has taken its final steps to remove the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. As the full slate of US-imposed sanctions on Iran kicks back into effect on Monday – as a consequence of the Trump administration pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in May – civil unrest is expected to only deepen across the economically embattled nation. But from the vantage point of several Iranian women long opposed to the reigning religious regime, such unrest and protest is the only way to bring about change; even if it means life on the run as a labeled “terrorist.” Iran remained defiant Monday as the re-imposition of sanctions took hold in the Islamic Republic. While global migration levels are currently at an unprecedented high – characterized by graphic images of refugees on the run in the Middle East, caravans traversing Central America and flimsy boats from Africa capsizing in the Mediterranean Sea – far less confronting is the silent toll of those who never make it a border, those who die or disappear on often-dangerous expeditions.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/amy-mcgraths-millions-werent-enough-unseat-andy-barr---split---Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr won re-election Tuesday night. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Kentucky Republican Andy Barr has survived a competitive challenge from Marine veteran Amy McGrath, who raised record sums of money as a House candidate and whose viral videos captured national attention. With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Barr led McGrath 51 percent to 48 percent when The Associated Press called the 6th District race. McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot made a splash last year with an introductory video about the letters she wrote to members of Congress asking them to change the law so that women could fly in combat. Despite not being the favorite of national Democrats, she won the May Democratic primary, defeating Jim Gray, the Lexington mayor and the 2016 Senate nominee. She went on to raise nearly $8 million by the end of the pre-general reporting period on Oct. 17. But that wasn’t enough to hold off Barr, a three-term incumbent running in a district that President Donald Trump won by 15 points in 2016. Barr used all the money McGrath raised to argue that she was a liberal outsider who only recently moved into the Lexington-based district. McGrath responded to those attacks by playing up her military service. Republicans also seized on audio leaked from a Massachusetts fundraiser, in which McGrath bragged about being progressive. “I am further left, I am more progressive, than anyone in the state of Kentucky,” she was heard saying in the audio. Barr’s ads repeatedly played up his ties to the district. One of his final spots alluded to the migrant caravan traveling through Central America — a favorite recent topic for Trump — to attack McGrath on immigration, accusing her of supporting “open borders.” Watch: Toss-Up Kentucky 6th Debate in 4 Minutes Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Barbara Comstock lost her bid for a third term in the 10th District. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) The defeat of Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock is a bad sign for other Republicans trying to hang on in well-educated, suburban districts where President Donald Trump is unpopular. Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton unseated the two-term Republican congresswoman Tuesday night. With 83 percent of precincts reporting, Wexton led Comstock 54 percent to 45 percent when The Associated Press called the race. Comstock has survived tough races before. She over-performed the president in 2016, when Hillary Clinton carried the 10th District by 10 points. She’d worked to distance herself from Trump and her party, voting against the Republican health care bill last year. But that didn’t stop Democrats from tying her to the president on health care. She did vote for the GOP tax overhaul, which was another source of Democratic attacks. Comstock was No. 4 on Roll Call’s latest ranking of the 10 most vulnerable incumbents. Also on the list were several other Republicans representing similarly suburban districts, where well-educated and affluent voters may be looking for a check on the president. Those Republicans include Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder and Minnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-mike-braun-defeats-indiana-sen-joe-donnelly-fox-news-projects---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Indiana Senate candidate Mike Braun talks President Trump's influence on midterm election, key issues to voters in the Hoosier state. Republican Mike Braun will defeat incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly in the race for U.S. Senate in Indiana, Fox News projects. Braun set himself apart during the Senate race. He wore more relaxed outfits during primary debates and constantly touted his "outsider" status. “President Trump, he was a disrupter, outsider and businessman, and look what’s occurred,” Braun previously told Fox News. “I’ve lived it. I’ve signed thousands of paychecks just like the president did [as a businessman]. He was an inspiration for me to run for senator, and I hope for others as well. There needs to be more of us to step outside the comfort zone.” Braun labels himself a "conservative businessman" on his campaign website, adding President Trump will need "reinforcements" if he's aiming to truly "drain the swamp" in Washington, D.C. However, as some of his primary opponents pointed out, he voted with Democrats for more than a decade in state elections — though his campaign spokesman has claimed he only voted blue to disrupt the outcomes of those races. "Washington is chock full of politicians who talk a slick game, but comes up empty when it comes to getting real results. These politicians have done nothing to increase the prosperity and safety of our families and instead rigged the system to benefit the politically connected and themselves," Braun wrote on his website. He vows to protect the Second Amendment, which he says he supports 100 percent, noting that he's an avid hunter and member of the NRA. The Republican also called Obamacare an "unmitigated disaster" for the Hoosier State and demanded that it be repealed and replaced completely. This is a developing story.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/russia-china-iran-aim-influence-elections-officials-warn---split---Intelligence and homeland security officials are concerned about election meddling — and not just by Russian President Vladimir Putin. China and Iran are also threats. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images) The Justice Department on Friday charged a Russian woman with election interference just as top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies warned that Russia, China, and Iran are running influence campaigns seeking to sway American voters in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential campaigns. “We are concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies,” said the statement issued jointly by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. “These activities also may seek to influence voter perceptions and decision making in the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections.” The campaigns include “using social media to amplify divisive issues, sponsoring specific content in English-language media like RT and Sputnik, seeding disinformation through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates and disseminating foreign propaganda,” the statement said. Election infrastructure itself, including voting machines, election tallying computers, and voter databases, were unlikely to be directly affected, the agencies said. “Currently, we do not have any evidence of a compromise or disruption of infrastructure that would enable adversaries to prevent voting, change vote counts or disrupt our ability to tally votes in the midterm elections,” the statement said. Minutes after issuing the warning, the Justice Department said it was charging a Russian woman with conspiracy to interfere in the 2018 election. Elena Khusyaynova, a 44-year old Russian, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The woman, from St. Petersburg, Russia, had served as the chief accountant of “Project Lakhta,” a foreign influence operation funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and two companies he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering, the Justice Department said. Prigozhin is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has charged individuals working for entities funded by the same company as being behind Russian interference in the 2016 election. The alleged conspiracy sought to conduct what it called internally “information warfare against the United States,” the Justice Department said. “This effort was not only designed to spread distrust toward candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system in general, but also to defraud the United States by impeding the lawful functions of government agencies in administering relevant federal requirements.” The Russian-backed operation used social media and other online platforms to amplify Americans’ differences on immigration, gun control and the Second Amendment, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women’s March, and the NFL national anthem debate, the Justice Department said. “Members of the conspiracy took advantage of specific events in the United States to anchor their themes, including the shootings of church members in Charleston, South Carolina, and concert attendees in Las Vegas; the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally and associated violence; police shootings of African-American men; as well as the personnel and policy decisions of the current U.S. presidential administration,” the statement said. The Justice Department said it had received “exceptional cooperation” from Facebook, Twitter and other companies in marshaling the evidence. The arrest and the intelligence community warnings come just a little more than two weeks before a pivotal midterm election that could alter which party controls Congress, and potentially affect President Donald Trump’s ability to carry out his agenda. The Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have in recent months warned of an increased risk of cyberattack. In July, Coats said that the “warning lights are blinking red again,” similar to the kind of warning that U.S. intelligence agencies had seen in the months before the 9/11 attack. Coats said that while U.S. agencies weren’t seeing the kind of intrusion into election systems they had seen before the 2016 elections, “we fully realize we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself.” Nielsen echoed Coats’s warning in early September, adding that “our digital lives are in danger like never before.” While most of the focus on foreign campaigns disrupting U.S. election has been focused on Russia, in recent weeks, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have stepped up attacks on China, saying that Beijing too is running sophisticated campaigns to sway American voters. “Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies,” Pence said in a speech in early October. “As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.” Watch: House GOP Candidates Are Shying Away From Trump As Midterm Nears Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/closer-times-democratic-women-ballot-year/story?id=58544008---split---The “Pink Wave” in the 2018 midterm election is tinted blue. Across the country, 278 women won major party nominations this year in the U.S. House, Senate and gubernatorial races, shattering previous records and setting the stage for a potential dramatic shift in the gender balance of national politics. Take for example the House congressional races. There are currently only 84 women in the U.S. House of Representatives (out of 435 total members total), but this year, including the 84 already in Congress, an astonishing 239 women are on the ballot for these seats.   In short, the House could look very different next year, especially on the Democratic side. Of the 239 women nominated in Houses races, 187 are Democrats, and 52 are Republicans. In the Senate primaries this year, Democratic voters nominated 15 women in states across the country, whereas Republicans nominated 8 women in senate races. The breakdown in gubernatorial races is similar.    Historically, women have tilted Democratic in their voting patterns, and the Trump administration seems to have only deepened those voter preferences. According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, women who are registered to vote support Democratic candidates by a margin of 59 to 37 percent, while men split about evenly, 46 to 48 percent. Women also hold more negative views of the president. For example, 61 percent of women say they disapprove of his work in office, compared to 45 percent of men. President Trump’s election was clearly a tipping point for Democratic women across the country to become more engaged in electoral politics. In conversations with over a dozen first-time female Democratic candidates, ABC News heard similar stories about women feeling compelled to protest, organize and run for office in direct response to Hillary Clinton’s loss, the president’s treatment of women, and Republican policies on health care, government spending and family issues. The groundswell of Democratic women entering politics this year come from diverse backgrounds and careers and bring with them wide-ranging expertise as doctors, former national security intelligence officers, veterans, teachers, and small business owners.   Liuba Grechen Shirley is a nonprofit leader and mother of two, who is running for office for the first time in a congressional, traditionally red district in Long Island, New York. In an interview with ABC News last week, Grechen Shirley talked about the 2016 election as a “really difficult time.” She called her local Democratic Party office in Suffolk County, New York after President Trump was elected looking for a community and next steps. “I wanted to know what the plan was. Nobody got back to me. And then I called the League of Women Voters and the woman on the phone said, “I sense the desperation in your voice, and I think this is your leadership moment.”   Gretchen Shirley said her frustration grew and in the early part of 2017, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She organized a Facebook group, which quickly grew to over 3,000 people across her district. She sent out daily action alerts urging those in the group to call their congressman and write letters. When the incumbent congressman, Rep. Peter King, R-NY, supported the president’s “Muslim ban,” that drew hard and fast lines barring people from predominantly Muslim countries from coming to the U.S., she called for a last minute protest and 400 people showed up.          King later voted for the Republican health care bill, and refused to come to a town hall that Gretchen Shirley organized. “I couldn't not do it. And there were a lot of reasons that I shouldn't do it, but in the end, I just had to," Shirley told ABC News when talking about the beginning of her congressional run. "I couldn't sit back and watch what was happening anymore." “Yes, it is the 'Year of the Woman,' but it is also the year of average everyday Americans who have just had enough. Most people don’t think about running for office. It’s usually for the elite, the people who are independently wealthy … But this is the kind of year where all kinds of people are just saying, ‘enough is enough.’ We're going to fight back,” she said.   Muthoni Wambu Kraal, vice president of national outreach and training at EMILY’s List, told ABC News that Democratic women are feeling an “urgency” to create change in communities across the country. Republicans have pointed out that they do have a number of strong female candidates this year, including several in more moderate and swing districts that Hillary Clinton won, such as Lea Marquez Peterson in the Tucson, Arizona area, Maria Elvira Salazar in Miami, Florida and Young Kim in Orange County, California. Still, Matt Gorman, the Communications Director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, conceded that the party’s efforts to recruit women to run is an “ongoing project.” “One of the things we learned when we started to focus on recruiting more women in 2012 and 2014 is that the recruiting process is not a two-year period. It can take two, four or six years to get some of these women in,” Gorman said. “Men are still much more likely to jump in, even on short notice.” Gorman pushed back against the idea that the president had made it harder for the GOP to recruit women. Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik from New York was appointed as recruiting chair for the party this cycle, to emphasize and encourage more female Republican candidates.       Matt Schlapp, a long-time Republican strategist agreed that recruiting a diverse set of candidates continued to be a challenge for the party. When asked about the gender disparity between Democratic and Republican candidates during an episode of ABC News’ Powerhouse Politics podcast, Schlapp said that he thought it was an issue, and that the Republicans should keep focusing on it. “I think the big thing I've learned in politics over the years is that, you know, you have to have a welcome mat. You have to be encouraging people,” he said. “On both sides we have a system that might still be dominated by men, and I think we ought to wherever possible do everything we can to make sure we have diverse candidates that look like America. I want to be a part of a nationwide party not a regional party,” he added.  
---split---3.0---split---http://insider.foxnews.com---split---A number of polling locations on Long Island, New York, declined to offer voters "I Voted" stickers during Tuesday's midterms due to budget constraints. 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis blasted President Donald Trump for his jabs at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, adding that it reflects the "kind of racism this guy seems to stand for." Laura Ingraham said Tuesday on The Five that midterm voters opposed to President Trump are resisting his tone and personality. Neil Cavuto pressed AFL-CIO labor union leader Richard Trumka on whether he supports the changes President Trump has made in regard to trade and the economy, and asked who his members are supporting in Tuesday's election.

More info: Privacy Policy Midterm elections in the US will be held on Tuesday, November 6. Sputnik spoke about it to Wendy Rogers, Republican candidate for Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the US House. Sputnik: What is your take on the elections outcome? Wendy Rogers: I think Republicans keep the Senate and control of the House will be close. Seats like mine will determine the outcome. Should we win, which I think we have a great chance of it, we pick up a seat that was supposed to be Democrat. Sputnik: This year's elections are expected to hit a 50 year record turnout rate for midterm elections, why is that? Wendy Rogers: There is a lot on the line. Much like the Presidential election of 2016. You can have a pro-America pro-jobs Republican agenda, or an open borders high tax Democrat agenda. It doesn't get any clearer than that.   Wendy Rogers: Because if President Trump is allowed to keep going with his pro-jobs agenda, every country will do well. I haven't seen any rockets flying over Japan lately. ISIS isn't killing innocent people lately. These are good things for the world. Sputnik: What consequences can these results have on US relations with countries like China and Russia? Wendy Rogers: We shall see. The more help we can get President Trump, the better. Sputnik: What impact can the results have on the anti-Russia hysteria that has dominated the Democratic party's agenda in the elections? What impact did it have on the election results? Wendy Rogers: I can tell you, Russia isn't interfering in Arizona's 1st district. I haven't seen any Russians. READ MORE: Midterms: Most Violent Rhetoric Comes From Democrats — Ex-CIA Officer Sputnik: What changes can we expect to see in Donald Trump's domestic and foreign policies if any? Wendy Rogers: If Republicans keep the House of Representatives, look to see an even stronger United States economy and a stronger military. Sputnik: According to reports the Democratic candidates have hauled unprecedented funds for the midterm elections: If Democrats win- was the funding the main reason behind the victory or where there other factors that impacted the results? If yes then what were they? Wendy Rogers: They definitely have a fundraising advantage, mainly from left-wing billionaires like George Soros, Tom Steyer, and Michael Bloomberg. In the end of the day it will be about voters and the future of America. Voters are smart, they don't always believe what they see on TV. Sputnik: If Democrats lose: despite these funds the Democratic party still suffered a loss, in your view what were the main reasons for that? Wendy Rogers: The American people will have told the politicians they want more of what we have had in the last 2 years. Secure border, less regulation, less taxes, more jobs, and more common sense.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/west-virginia-senate-manchin-morrisey-trump---split---Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., holds Ava Lott, the 2018 Ripley 4th of July Wee Miss, before a parade. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call) Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has won re-election in West Virginia in the heart of Trump country, dispatching Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morissey. With 69 percent of precincts reporting, Manchin led Morrisey 50 percent to 46 percent when The Associated Press called the race. President Donald Trump carried the Mountain State by 42 points in 2016, and a Manchin victory here helps his party narrow its Senate losses in a year when Democrats in Trump states are on defense. One of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, Manchin held the edge in this race since the summer. Some GOP polling continued to show Morrisey competitive, but by late fall, Republicans had largely conceded this seat was out of reach, with Senate Leadership Fund going dark here in the final week of the race. Manchin played up his willingness to work with the president and buck his own party. He was the only Democrat in the Senate to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, and he ran ads touting his support for a border wall. He made health care and his support for protections for people with pre-existing health conditions a central part of his campaign. [Braun Defeats Donnelly in Indiana] Morrisey provided a convenient foil on that issue: as state attorney general, he had signed on to a Texas lawsuit that is challenging the 2010 health care law. (Manchin filmed an ad of him shooting a copy of the lawsuit, which was reminiscent of a 2010 spot in which he shot the cap-and-trade bill.) Morrisey ran as anti-Washington outsider, touting his lawsuits against former President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations. He also tried to tie Manchin to Hillary Clinton, whom the incumbent had supported in 2016 but backed away from this year. But Morrisey’s punches against the former two-term governor were largely mitigated by his own vulnerabilities. A former Capitol Hill staffer, he spent much of his career in the nation’s capital. His and his wife’s previous lobbying work gave Democrats plenty of ammunition, especially when it came to pharmaceutical companies and the opioid crisis. [5 Things That Defined the Fight for the Senate] Manchin played up his West Virginia roots, while Democrats reminded voters that Morrisey was not a Mountain State native. He first ran for Congress in New Jersey, and later moved into the eastern panhandle in 2006. National Democrats invested early in this race, playing a major role in the three-way GOP primary. They spent nearly $2 million against GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins, whom they believed would give Manchin the toughest challenge. National Republicans, meanwhile, had to spend here against former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship to make sure he wasn’t the nominee.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/election-2018-races-to-watch/---split---To say that there’s a lot riding on the midterm elections would be an understatement. For Democrats, it’s a chance to take over the House of Representatives and serve as a check on President Trump’s administration and a (likely) Republican-led Senate. For Republicans, it’s an opportunity to press forward on reforms to healthcare and tax policy that evaded them in the first two years of the Trump presidency. This election also comes at a critical time for the tech industry, when members of both parties are beginning to challenge the dominance of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. No longer the golden children of a new economy, these juggernauts have faced pointed questions from Congress and state governments on everything from their data collection practices to their business models to how they moderate and police speech. At the same time, important questions about issues like net neutrality and data privacy hang in limbo. Whether the House goes blue or stays red could shape any upcoming privacy legislation, and a Democratic House could move forward on restoring net neutrality, something the Senate has already approved. When voters head to the polls on November 6, they may not be as focused on technology as they are on, say, healthcare or gun control. But the results may well impact Big Tech in a big way, which, in turn, impacts all of us. Here’s who and what to watch for this election night: Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee's Senate Race Republican Marsha Blackburn, a US representative since 2003, and Democrat Phil Bredesen, the former governor of the state, are running to replace senator Bob Corker, who is retiring this year. Though Bredesen led the polls for much of 2018, Blackburn has taken the lead in recent months. Blackburn has a polarizing record on tech. She has been called "Big Telecom's best friend in Congress," thanks to her repeated efforts to ease regulation on telecom companies. She fought against the Federal Communication Commission's attempts to pave the way for municipal broadband programs in rural parts of the country under the Obama administration. As chair of the House Communication and Technology Subcommittee, she supported the current FCC's decision to overturn net neutrality protections. Her record on privacy is also mixed. She introduced the House bill last year to overturn Obama-era protections that required broadband providers to get permission before selling peoples' internet browsing history. But once that repeal was successful, she introduced the so-called BROWSER Act, which would restore those protections, the only difference being that the Federal Trade Commission would oversee enforcement instead of the FCC. That bill hasn't progressed in the House. If all of that didn't already make her a controversial figure in tech circles, there's her recent comments about bias in Silicon Valley. She accused Twitter of conservative censorship, after the company took down an ad of hers that charged Planned Parenthood with selling "baby body parts." She alleged liberal bias at Google, too, following a Breitbart report that said one Google staffer called her a "terrorist" and a "violent thug" in internal emails. In June, she issued a warning shot against tech companies in an op-ed for Fox News. "Big Tech should take time to remember that although this light touch regulatory environment allowed them to flourish, they do not have a blank check," she wrote. Josh Hawley in Missouri's Senate Race Missouri's Republican attorney general Josh Hawley is taking on Democrat Claire McCaskill for her Senate seat. It's a seat Democrats desperately want to hold onto, but as it stands, Hawley is a few points ahead. That could spell bad news for Google, Facebook, and other tech giants. As attorney general, Hawley was responsible for launching an antitrust investigation into Google's business practices. The investigation sought answers as to how the search giant collects user data and whether it leverages its market position to push its own products. Hawley also launched an investigation into Facebook's data-sharing practices, after tens of millions of Americans' Facebook data was misappropriated by the political firm Cambridge Analytica, and another into Equifax after its historic data breach last year. And just this fall, Missouri got a $2.2 million slice of a nationwide settlement with Uber over its data breach, which was being investigated by Hawley's office. He's campaigned on a promise of being tough on tech. If Hawley heads to Washington, he could join with some Democratic colleagues as an antitrust and privacy watchdog. Bill Nelson in Florida's Senate Race Bill Nelson defending his seat against Republican governor Rick Scott in a tight race. As the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee, Nelson has helped oversee recent congressional hearings on, among other things, protecting consumer privacy. If he loses next week, the title of ranking member could fall to someone like Amy Klobuchar or Richard Blumenthal, both of whom have been much more vocal about tech policy. Klobuchar introduced a data privacy bill that would increase transparency in data collection and tracking. She also introduced the Honest Ads Act, which proposed new transparency requirements on digital political ads. Blumenthal, meanwhile, co-sponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, which was signed into law earlier this year, despite widespread backlash from the tech industry. And in a recent Commerce Committee hearing, he voiced support for California's recently passed data privacy law, which tech giants have been working hard to gut. Either one of these senators in a leadership role on the committee would signal a bold privacy stance for Democrats—even bolder if Democrats pull off the unlikely feat of winning back the Senate. Ted Cruz in Texas's Senate Race On election night, all eyes will be on Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat who has waged an unexpectedly successful fight against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. If O'Rourke wins in a bright red state like Texas, where he is still about six points behind, it will be a big win for Democrats. Tech giants might also breathe a sigh of relief. Cruz was never tight with big tech, but lately, their relationship has been particularly strained. In a recent debate against O'Rourke, Cruz toyed with the idea of repealing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from being held accountable for what their users say on their platforms. Cruz isn't the only member of Congress who has floated this idea; so have members of the House. (Experts say these proposals are based on a flawed interpretation of Section 230.) Meanwhile, during a recent congressional hearing, Cruz also pointedly questioned Google's chief privacy officer on the company's interest in building a censored search engine for China, as well as its decision to pull out of a Department of Defense machine learning contract. O'Rourke, on the other hand, comes from a tech background. Before entering politics, he started his own software and web development firm. He has advocated for stronger antitrust regulations as part of his economic platform, but his campaign has also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals and groups associated with Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. In fact, he's raised more from Alphabet than any other candidate this cycle. Just how O'Rourke would handle tech's tremendous power is still unclear. But one thing's for sure: His campaign sure loves Facebook ads: it has spent more than $5 million on them since May. Will Hurd in Texas's 23rd Congressional District Race Representative Will Hurd joined Congress in 2015 after a career at the Central Intelligence Agency and as an adviser to a cybersecurity firm. That makes Hurd one of the House's most tech-savvy members, and in his short time on Capitol Hill, he's put that background to use. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Information Technology, Hurd has convened hearings on issues like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. He's also introduced bills that would elevate the role of the nation's chief information officer and modernize government technology. Last year, President Trump signed the Modernizing Government Technology Act into law. Now, Hurd is seeking reelection against a tough challenge from Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, an Iraq War veteran. Keith Ellison in Minnesota's Attorney General Race Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison is making a bid for Minnesota's attorney general seat. His campaign has been dogged by allegations of domestic violence, which Ellison has denied, but which may have caused Ellison to lose ground in the polls. His opponent, Doug Wardlow, looks poised to win. But if Ellison does become attorney general, the tech industry could be looking at even more state-driven antitrust activity. As a member of Congress, Ellison is part of the newly formed Antitrust Caucus and introduced a House bill that would require the FTC and Department of Justice to conduct annual studies on company mergers. He has reserved particularly harsh criticism for Amazon, saying in a podcast last year that "Amazon has gotten where it is because it has undertaken business practices… that previously used to be illegal." Ellison is just one of many Democrats vying for an attorney general seat: There are 30 up for grabs this year; 18 are held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats. While the House and Senate get the lion's share of attention, these races are worth watching, too. If Democrats pick up more seats, tech monopolies could find themselves with a far less friendly landscape of state regulators next year. Josh Harder in California's 10th Congressional District In his bid to represent California's 10th congressional district, Democrat Josh Harder has raised money from some of Silicon Valley's most prominent investors: Sam Altman, John Doerr, Ron Conway, and Rob Stavis, to name a few. That stands to reason, since Harder used to be one of them. The 32-year-old political neophyte is a former vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners, a Menlo Park venture capital firm with investments in tech giants like Pinterest, LinkedIn, Skype, and Yelp. Harder's opponent, Republican incumbent Jeff Denham, has capitalized on the techlash in political ads, framing Harder as "a shady San Francisco venture capitalist." Right now, the race is considered a toss-up. If Harder wins, he might help Democrats win back the House. He might also help represent the tech industry's interests in Washington. The Proposition C Ballot Initiative in San Francisco Any policy proposal that pits tech's billionaires against one another is certainly worth watching. A ballot initiative in San Francisco called Proposition C is one. Earlier this month, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey squared off on Twitter over the proposition, which would levy a 0.175 percent to 0.69 percent tax on companies with over $50 million in gross annual receipts to raise money to address the homelessness crisis in San Francisco. All in, the tax would raise $300 million, which would go toward refurbishing and constructing housing units, as well as mental health services, among other things. Benioff has thrown his full support behind the initiative, while Dorsey says that he stands with local officials, including San Francisco's mayor, who oppose it. For Benioff, the equation is simple: San Francisco's tech barons, including himself, have amassed unprecedented wealth while the city continues to struggle with homelessness. "We cannot separate ourselves from others," he recently told WIRED. "We have to get back to the feeling that we’re one, and that we are responsible for the city that we are living in and growing our businesses in.” And yet, Mayor London Breed says that Proposition C could only exacerbate the problem. She argues that the proposal lacks accountability, that it fails to audit the money the city is already spending on homelessness, and that it could make San Francisco's crisis worse if the city begins to foot the bill for homeless citizens in neighboring counties. She has also argued that the proposal would hurt the local economy, causing up to a $240 million loss from the city’s GDP every year for the next twenty years. Critics have accused Breed of being bought by the wealthy techies who financed her mayoral campaign, including Dorsey's Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Dorsey, meanwhile, has other motives beyond standing by the mayor. The Twitter CEO is also head of the payments company, Square. In a recent tweetstorm, Dorsey argued that payment processors like Square and Stripe, which also opposes Proposition C, would be taxed at a higher rate than companies like Salesforce. That's because they'd be taxed on total revenue, some of which they share with credit card companies, rather than adjusted revenue—the amount Square gets to keep. Voices on both sides of the debate say that helping San Francisco's homeless is their first priority. Now, it's up to voters to decide who wins. The California Governor’s race Speaking of San Francisco, the former mayor of the city, Gavin Newsom, will likely become the next governor of California this election night. The Democrat and current lieutenant governor maintains a solid lead against his opponent John Cox. Newsom has also indicated that he's against Proposition C, saying that the homelessness problem is a regional issue, not just a city-wide one, and must be addressed at the state level. If Proposition C does pass, neither the governor nor the state legislature will be able to do anything about it; changing the law would require another ballot referendum. Still, as governor, Newsom would set the agenda for the state's economy—an economy that's larger than most countries, and one that hinges on Big Tech.

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-final-midterm-pitch-two-words-health-care---split---House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the first order of business for a Democrat-controlled House would be a bipartisan good-government bill aimed at rooting out the influence of dark money and special interest groups from Washington. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s final pitch to voters on Tuesday as they hit the polls centered on one issue: health care. “This election is about health care,” the California Democrat said at a news conference alongside Democratic House Campaign Committee chairman Ben Ray Luján. It was a pitch two years in the making. The day after President Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016, Pelosi said, Democrats “didn’t agonize, we organized. We went to work and said, ‘How do we protect the Affordable Care Act?’” In 2017, Democrats voted “100 percent” against the House GOP’s repeal of the 2010 health care law, Pelosi said. The GOP passed its replacement bill anyway. It was stopped in the Senate by one vote. But House Democrats decided early on in the 2018 cycle to center their messaging on protecting a law whose prospective repeal drove millions of Republicans to the polls in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 for a GOP House majority. “We made our own environment to make sure people knew the difference between Democrats and Republicans” on health care, Pelosi said. Luján and Pelosi expressed confidence that Democrats would pick up enough seats in the House — they need 23 — to win back a majority they have not held since the 2010 GOP wave. “The rain is not scaring anyone away,” Luján said, citing reports of long lines in battleground districts across the river in Virginia and elsewhere. Pelosi would not entertain the possibility of Democrats failing to gain a majority when pressed by a reporter whether Democrats had considered all contingencies. On the Republican side, their final pitch has been fractured at the top, with President Donald Trump harping on illegal immigration and the potential national security threats stemming from a pair of caravans of Central American immigrants still weeks away from reaching the southern border. Speaker Paul D. Ryan had urged the president to remain focused on the nation’s strong economy. GDP growth is steady and unemployment is at an historic low. But Trump used a six-day, eight-state, 11-rally barnstorming tour to close out the midterms campaign season, fanning partisan flames over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process. And he lamented the negative political consequences for Republicans right before the midterms of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting where a gunman slaughtered 11 Jews and a Florida man’s arrest for sending unexploded pipe bombs to at least 10 of the president’s Democratic rivals. Pelosi indicated Tuesday, as she has in the months leading up to the election, that the first order of business for a Democrat-controlled House would be a bipartisan good-government bill aimed at rooting out the influence of dark money and special interest groups from Washington politics. “When people believe that there will be integrity of government, that you reduce the role of special interests and money,” Pelosi said, “they believe then that we can make a difference, that we can pass gun safety because we’re not dominated by NRA money, that we can pass environmental protections because we’re not dominated by industry money in that regard.” Luján and Pelosi urged voters in districts with checkered pasts regarding alleged voter suppression to not stay home or or ditch the line when it becomes too long. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division has deployed personnel to monitor polling places in 35 counties across 19 states, including key jurisdictions in Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania where voter turnout could well decide which party obtains a majority in the Senate. “Do not let their scare tactics frighten you away from the polls,” Pelosi said of Democratic opponents, though she did not cite any specific examples or reports of such tactics being used on Tuesday. Luján said he is “confident” in the integrity of the midterm elections Tuesday. “We have robust legal strategy to make sure that we’re protecting” voting rights in every district, Luján said.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-dont-care-house-democrats-release-tax-returns---split---The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington. President Donald Trump says he wouldn’t care if House Democrats release his tax returns. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) President Trump claimed Monday he is not concerned about House Democrats obtaining and releasing his tax returns if they win the House majority in Tuesday’s midterm elections. “I don’t care,” he told reporters as he arrived in Indiana for a campaign rally. “They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want,” the president said, according to a pool report. [Live Blog: Updates from Trump’s Final Day on Campaign Trail] He has refused to release his tax records as other politicians and presidents have, with White House aides contending he is still in the midst of what would be a lengthy IRS audit — which itself does not bar anyone from releasing tax details. Control of the House comes with subpoena power and the ability to use it to get his returns and potentially make them public. Some Democrats and Trump critics have long suggested the records would show the president is not worth as much as he claims. In May 2016, he contended a net worth “in excess” of $10 billion. Meantime, he also was asked how he will respond if Democrats win the House. “We’ll just have to work a little bit differently,” he told reporters without elaborating on those different tactics. While he has signed an anti-opioids bill and annual spending measures, he has yet to help broker a single piece of bipartisan legislation; for instance, he helped nix a compromise Senate immigration bill and several White House directed infrastructure weeks have produced no broad legislation.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/2018-house-election-results-n931416---split---Democrats have a 65 percent chance of reclaiming the House majority, NBC News estimated Tuesday night. The party could win as many as 31 seats — well over the 23 needed for the majority — for a total of 224, according to the estimate. The call came with Democrats positioned to claim victory in a handful of bellwether congressional races, as polls began closing in some parts of the eastern U.S. In Virginia, NBC News projected that incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock would lose her House seat in the state's 10th Congressional District to Democrat Jennifer Wexton. The race, in a suburban northern Virginia district Hillary Clinton won by 10 percentage points in 2016, had been regarded by many observers as critical to Republican hopes of maintaining control of the lower chamber. In Florida, Democrat Donna Shalala, former Health and Human Services secretary under President Bill Clinton, was projected to win Florida's 27th Congressional District. The Miami seat had been held by retiring GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who had represented the area since 1989. And in Colorado, Democrat Jason Crow defeated Denver-area GOP incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman. But Republicans appeared to hold on in some closely-fought contests, such as Virginia's 5th Congressional District: the seat, which had been held by GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, was projected to go to Republican Denver Riggleman over Democrat Leslie Cockburn. And in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Rep. Andy Barr was projected to hold off a stiff challenge by Democrat Amy McGrath. Across the country, voter turnout records seemed poised to fall, as the fight over control of Congress reached the final round of what was widely viewed as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his first two years in office. According to NBC News exit polls, two out of every three voters Tuesday said Trump was a factor in their House vote, with 26 percent saying they cast their vote to express support for the president and 38 percent saying their vote was intended to oppose the president. As the night began, Republicans held a 235-193 advantage in the lower chamber, with seven vacant seats. Democrats had hoped to experience a wave election similar to the 2006 midterms when they captured 31 GOP-held seats amid voter discontent with President George W. Bush and the Iraq war. Republicans had been hopeful the booming economy this year could benefit their party. Except for two recent midterm elections — in 1998, amid President Bill Clinton's impeachment saga, and in 2002, the year after the Sept. 11 attacks — midterm elections have generally been unfavorable to the party in control of the White House. Since President Harry S. Truman's tenure, the incumbent president's party has averaged a loss of more than 28 House seats in his first midterm election. Trump, who had no public events Tuesday, said earlier in the week that Democrats could win the House. "It will be ridiculous, frankly," he said at a campaign rally in Huntington, West Virginia. "It'll be bad for our country. The Democrats — and it could happen. Could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. But it could happen." Analysts have predicted that Democrats had a much better chance at winning the House than the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a narrow 51-49 majority. It was a difficult path for Democrats to reclaim the upper chamber, with far more Democratic than Republican seats up for re-election, and 10 of their incumbents running in states won by Trump in 2016. Asked by reporters early Tuesday if she were 100 percent confident Democrats would re-take the House, Pelosi answered in the affirmative: "Yes, I am," she said. Political observers had eyed 15 Republican-held House seats that are most likely to flip to Democrats in states such as Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa and California, among others. Several of those seats are held by GOP lawmakers who decided to retire, including Reps. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., and Ryan Costello, R-Pa. There are also 23 races that are mostly considered toss-ups in states like Virginia, Illinois, Michigan and Texas, such as the races between incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Democrat Colin Allred; incumbent Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., and Democrat Anthony Brindisi; and incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and Democrat Harley Rouda.

(Photo: Butch Dill/AP) The final days of the 1980 presidential campaign were framed around a simple question: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” The answer was a resounding “no.” President Donald Trump could ask a similar question today, and the answer would be a deafening “yes.” The American economy is booming after only two years under our administration. This happened because of the president’s leadership and support from Republicans in Congress. Tuesday, we’re counting on the American people to re-elect Republicans to deliver even more results. Since Election Day 2016, businesses have created nearly 4.5 million jobs, including nearly 450,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate hasn’t been lower in 49 years, and we’ve reached record lows for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Wages and benefits are rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade, and middle-class incomes have never been higher. After a 10-year lapse, America is the world’s most competitive economy once again. This recovery is the result of sound policy and strong Republican leadership in the White House and Congress. OUR VIEW: Elect a Congress that will do its constitutional duty Together, we’ve rolled back red tape at a record pace, we’ve unleashed American energy, and we’ve forged new trade deals that are free, fair and reciprocal and put American jobs and farmers first, including a new deal among the United States, Mexico and Canada. We’ve been enforcing our laws and securing our borders, and we’ve already started to build the wall on our southern border. More: Is Trump's border wall being built? Here are the facts And Congress and the president enacted historic tax cuts giving an average family of four $2,000 of their hard-earned money back every year. While Republicans have delivered results, Democrats have chosen a one-word agenda: Resist. That party wants to roll back the progress we’ve made over the past two years. As the Democrats proved the last time they ran Congress, their agenda meant fewer jobs, lower wages, slower growth and less opportunity for hardworking Americans. But now the Democrats’ policies are even more liberal — and dangerous — than ever before. They want massive tax hikes, weaker borders and a complete government takeover of health care that would hurt our families and seniors. The country can’t afford for Democrats to seize control of Washington. This boom began at the ballot box in November 2016, but our progress could end at the ballot box in November 2018. After two years of accomplishment, the choice in this election is between results or resistance. President Trump and I urge the American people to re-elect Republican majorities to Congress to deliver more results. Imagine where we’ll be two years from now.

---split---4.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-general-anticipates-5200-troops-deploy-border/story?id=58858411---split---The head of U.S. Northern Command expects that additional active duty troops will supplement the 5,239 already slated to deploy in support of the Trump administration's efforts to stop a migrant caravan making its way through Mexico. At the same time, Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy again denied sending thousands of troops to the border was part of a political stunt ahead of next week's midterm elections. Shaughnessy told reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday that additional forces could be required depending on future requests from Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). "There will be additional force over and above 5,239," said O'Shaughnessy. "The magnitude of that difference I don't have an answer for now because we don't know what that answer is."   A U.S. official told ABC News that 2,000 active duty troops have already been placed on "prepared to deploy" orders in anticipation of those requests. When asked if the U.S. military was being used as part of a political stunt, O'Shaughnessy noted that the U.S. military routinely partners with the Department of Homeland Security on a host of operations. However, previous administrations, including Trump's, have utilized National Guard troops, not active duty forces for border security. "I firmly believe that border security is national security and with that in mind that we are in support of Secretary Nielsen and her efforts to secure the border," the general said. According to O'Shaughnessy, approximately 1,000 troops have already been positioned at bases in Texas joining an additional 870 stationed at U.S. Army North in San Antonio.   More forces will continue to deploy to Texas, Arizona, and California by the end of the week and New Mexico is expected to receive forces as well in the future. He could not say when those forces would make their way to the border saying that would be done in coordination with CBP in the future. Among the units deploying to border states this week are two aviation units from the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg, which could be used to transport CBP agents to more remote areas along the border. Those units will head to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas and Davis-Montham Air Force Base in Arizona by Friday, according to Defense Department planning documents obtained by ABC News. The aviation units are among ten listed in the planning documents which are slated to be in place by Nov. 2 and conclude their mission on Dec. 15. They represent a fraction of the approximately 5,200 troops approved for the border security mission stood up in response to the migrant caravan -- still more than one thousand miles from the U.S. border. It's unclear if the caravan, which is reportedly moving about 25 miles each day, could arrive at the border in that time. Lackland AFB and Davis Monthan AFB, along with Camp Pendleton in California will serve as staging areas so the active duty troops can receive training on the rules of engagement and CBP procedures when they are eventually deployed along the border. O'Shaughnessy did not have a timetable for when the active duty forces would be sent to areas directly along the border.    Planning documents show that several military police companies will head to Lackland and Camp Pendleton in California, while two medical companies will deploy to Lackland and Davis-Montham. Additionally, a headquarters unit from the Marine's Corps Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) out of Pendleton will travel further south to San Diego. Imagery released by the Defense Department online suggests that other units already participating in the mission, dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot, include the 89th Military Police Brigade's Task Force Griffin out of Fort Hood and the 19th Engineering Battalion out of Fort Knox.  Federal law stipulates that active duty forces cannot act in a law enforcement capacity, and, therefore, will be limited to acting in support of CBP. Units are expected to provide CBP with planning assistance, engineering support, and fixed and rotary wing aviation, as well as provide personal protective equipment for CBP personnel.   The 5,239 troops approved for the mission -- more than double the number of U.S. service members deployed to Syria -- will join approximately 2,100 National Guard troops deployed to the borders of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas on a similar security mission since last April. Previous presidents have ordered the military to support anti-drug smuggling operations and active-duty troops still do so.  Trump has publicly declared that the migrant caravan, which he says contains Middle Easterners and terrorists, will be a central issue for the 2018 midterms just days away. The caravan, once 7,000-strong, has dwindled to about 3,500 men, women, and, children largely escaping poverty and violence in Central America.   O'Shaughnessy said that the U.S. is "working closely to understand the nature and makeup of this caravan." He would not say if terrorists were among the migrants, but told reporters that the caravan has differentiated itself from previous groups because of its level of organization. The general also expressed concern that elements of the caravan had used violence when crossing into Mexico from Guatemala. Despite suggestions by Trump to Fox News on Monday that tents along the border could be used to house migrants who have applied for asylum, O'Shaughnessy told reporters that the tents, along with building facilities, would only be erected to house CBP personnel.
---split---4.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-wins-governor.html---split---Supported by By Jesse McKinley and Shane Goldmacher Andrew M. Cuomo was resoundingly elected to a third term as governor of New York on Tuesday, riding Democratic enthusiasm in a deep blue state to beat back his Republican challenger and capture a victory for the party’s old guard. In defeating Marcus J. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, Mr. Cuomo, 60, mirrored his success in the September primary, in which he defeated Cynthia Nixon, the actress and education advocate. The race was called by The Associated Press shortly after polls had closed at 9 p.m. The general election campaign was far less fraught than the primary for Mr. Cuomo, who lampooned Mr. Molinaro, 43, as a “Trump mini-me” and described him as part of an “extreme conservative” movement that posed dire fiscal and social threats to New York. In winning a third term, Mr. Cuomo matched the feat of his father, Mario M. Cuomo, who served three terms from 1983 through 1994. The governor also burnished an electoral résumé that could be used to further his ample political ambition: Like his father, Mr. Cuomo has been mentioned as a possible presidential contender, though he has denied such ambitions. Still, the convincing win on Tuesday will most likely continue to fuel such speculation. Victory did not come cheaply. Mr. Cuomo spent more than $32.5 million since January to secure his third term, vastly more than all his opponents combined. He used the money to promote a record that has included legalizing same-sex marriage, increasing the minimum wage and establishing a paid family leave program. Those successes were more than enough to overcome two major corruption trials tied to his administration this year, as well as a crescendo of complaints about New York City’s deteriorating subways, which he oversees through his appointees on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. [Here are 10 of our best reads from our New York campaign coverage.] The Albany that Mr. Cuomo will return to will be different than the one he has led for nearly eight years. With the victories of a clutch of young, progressive Democrats to the State Legislature, the agenda in Albany may soon include a number of left-leaning initiatives, such as single-payer health care and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Republicans, meanwhile, seemed likely to continue an inglorious streak, having not won a statewide race since Gov. George E. Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002. The odds in New York are almost always against Republicans, as Democrats have more than a two-to-one advantage in voter registration. Mr. Molinaro seemingly had tried to woo some moderates by running a campaign that largely avoided social issues, though his past votes as a state assemblyman against same-sex marriage had been a potent source of attack for the Cuomo camp. Mr. Molinaro, who was elected mayor of Tivoli, N.Y., at 19, had also been unable to completely shed the association with President Trump, who is very unpopular in his home state; although he did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, he said he could embrace some of his policies if they were helpful to New York. Mr. Molinaro was also outgunned financially by Mr. Cuomo, an avid and successful fund-raiser who entered the closing days of the campaign with $6.7 million on hand, while Mr. Molinaro had only about $311,000, a pittance considering the costs of ads in New York City. (Mr. Cuomo had spent more than $20 million to handily defeat Ms. Nixon in the primary.) Mr. Cuomo maximized the power of incumbency, rolling out a steady series of events and official announcements, as well as being a regular presence on news programs in the wake of last month’s bomb attempts on public figures and media outlets. The governor made effective use of the state’s labor unions, which lent their support and resources to help quash Ms. Nixon and Mr. Molinaro. And Mr. Cuomo gave little oxygen to Mr. Molinaro, accepting only one invitation to debate, resulting in a single fractious hourlong encounter between the two major-party candidates. (Three minor party candidates had also challenged Mr. Cuomo: Stephanie Miner, the former mayor of Syracuse; Howie Hawkins, the Green Party candidate; and Larry Sharpe, a libertarian.) Mr. Cuomo has said little about what he specifically wants to do during a third term, though major infrastructure projects have been a passion of his, including a new Hudson River crossing that he named for his father. Mr. Molinaro and other Republicans had hoped that Mr. Cuomo would be vulnerable despite his obvious advantages. In particular, they hoped that the convictions of a close friend and former top aide, Joseph Percoco, and Mr. Cuomo’s economic guru, Alain E. Kaloyeros, on federal corruption charges earlier this year would give pause to voters far too accustomed to scandals in Albany. Mr. Cuomo’s name was repeatedly mentioned during both trials, though the governor was never accused of any wrongdoing, and had gone so far as to suggest that the lack of any charges was a positive sign of his own ethical behavior. A combative and unapologetic political tactician, Mr. Cuomo — a centrist by nature — has tacked left during Mr. Trump’s time in the White House, repeatedly attacking the president’s efforts on immigration and other issues, including his tax plan, which the governor has called an “economic missile” aimed at New York. After years of working closely with Republicans in Albany, the governor also brokered a treaty between two warring factions of Democrats in the State Senate.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/political-kaleidoscope-one-day-out-there-s-midterm-path-both-n931261---split---NEW YORK — As Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it, maybe the best way to view our final national NBC News/WSJ poll of the 2018 election cycle is as a kaleidoscope. “It is a political kaleidoscope,” said Hart, whose firm conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. “You turn the poll one way, and it looks [good for Democrats].” But if you turn it another way, he adds, “you can see how the GOP squeaks through.” Consider: So one set of numbers suggest that Democrats are in store for a big night; the other set of numbers indicate that it could be a better-than-expected performance for Republicans. All things considered — when you look at Democratic advantages with independents, with women and more enthusiastic Latino and millennial voters — you probably have to give Democrats the advantage heading into tomorrow night’s election, says McInturff, the GOP pollster. “It has closed. It is a more competitive race,” he said. “But for Republicans, it feels slightly short of where you’d want to be for a national election.” We’ll find out tomorrow night. Speaking of turning the political kaleidoscope, our final NBC/Marist polls of Florida and Missouri paint a rosier Senate outlook for Democrats than the conventional wisdom and map suggests. One of us on the slight lead for Dems in Florida: “At the top of the ticket, Democrat Andrew Gillum is up among likely voters against Republican Ron DeSantis, 50 percent to 46 percent, within the poll’s margin of error. That’s a similar margin to the five-point lead NBC News and Marist found in September, when Gillum led 48 percent to 43 percent... The margin is identical for Democrats in the closely watched Senate contest between incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson and outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Scott. Nelson leads Scott 50 percent to 46 percent among likely voters. Among the larger pool of all registered voters, Nelson leads 50 percent to 45 percent.” And another of us on the margin-of-error contest in Missouri: “McCaskill, the state’s incumbent senator, gets support from 50 percent of likely voters in a head-to-head matchup, while Hawley, the state’s attorney general, gets 47 percent. Just 3 percent of likely voters say they’re undecided. In September’s NBC/Marist poll of the state, McCaskill and Hawley were tied at 47 percent each. When the ballot expands to include the Libertarian and Green Party candidates, McCaskill’s lead remains at 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent. The results are all within the poll’s margin of error of plus-minus 5.2 percentage points. Other recent polls of Missouri show the race tied.” So our two NBC polls paint two slightly different pictures here at the end — the national NBC/WSJ shows a closer horserace than a month ago (though the difference is within the margin of error), and the state NBC/Marist polls of Florida and Missouri have Democrats ahead (though within the margin of error) So how do you explain the contradiction — outside of the margin of error? Well, the polls are different, with different likely-voter models. The national NBC/WSJ poll is taken from a voter-file list, and likely voters are determined by past participation and/or current interest. The Marist polls, meanwhile, are taken from random-digit-dialing, and likely voters are determined by a probability model By and large, the NBC/WSJ poll is a more cautious poll, while Marist might be capturing more new voters. Which better shows the current direction and momentum? We don’t know, but we’re glad we have these (different) products, because there’s no perfect way to do this, especially in an environment where turnout will be unprecedented. Rick Scott popularity dips: Our NBC/Marist poll of Florida also finds this: “Gillum’s favorability stands at 48 percent favorable/40 percent unfavorable among likely voters. For his GOP rival, DeSantis, 43 percent of likely voters have a favorable impression of him, while 45 percent disagree.” “Nelson, who has served in the Senate since 2000, gets a favorable rating from 45 percent of likely voters, with 42 percent giving him a thumbs down. That’s compared with rival Scott’s 42 percent favorable/50 percent unfavorability. That net negative rating of -8 percent for Scott is a drop from a net positive rating of +1 percent in September.” It’s worth asking: If the dip in Scott’s popularity is real, is it because he’s embraced being with Trump in the final days? Remember, he had been keeping his distance for most of this 2018 season… If Scott loses, we will look back on the last 10 days and ask: Why did he forego all the effort to distance himself from Trump and party to campaign with Trump twice in the last 10 days? Despite a rough overall political environment for the GOP, we still have detected quiet confidence from Republican strategists and pollsters. And if you experienced 2016, it’s hard not be confident that 2018 could be 2016 all over again — or close to it. But also don’t forget what happened in Virginia and Alabama in 2017, or the special elections of 2017-2018. President Trump holds rallies today in Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45 pm ET, in Fort Wayne, Ind., at 6:05 pm ET, and in Cape Girardeau, Mo. at 10:00 pm ET “Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, said Sunday that he was investigating the state Democratic Party for an attempted hack of the voter registration system — a claim met with a swift response from Democrats charging him with a shameless "political stunt" two days before Election Day,” per NBC News. “Kemp, who is in a neck-and-neck race with Stacey Abrams, alleged that the state Democratic Party made a ‘failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system’ and announced that his office was opening an investigation into the party. Kemp said his office alerted the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but he offered no evidence to back up his allegation.” It’s one of the inherent conflicts of interest when a sitting secretary of state — heading up elections in a state — runs for higher office in that same state… Chuck Todd is moderator of "Meet The Press" and NBC News' political director.

(Photo: RICK D'ELIA, EPA-EFE) WASHINGTON – Marsha Blackburn, a GOP U.S. representative, defeated Tennessee’s former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in her bid to become the state’s first woman senator. NBC, Fox News and CNN called the race in her favor. She will replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker. And she isn't the only woman making her mark in early election returns. Already, Guam elected its first woman governor, as former lawmaker Lou Leon Guerrero, a Democrat, claimed the position for her party for the first time since 2003. And Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat who ran unopposed, became the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts. Women could make significant electoral gains in this “Year of the Woman” election, driven largely by the massive “resistance” movement to President Donald Trump that began after the 2016 election. In CNN exit polls, almost 80% of voters said it was very or somewhat important to see more women elected. That was a higher priority for women than for men, but not by much, CNN said. Women have smashed records this election cycle in terms of the number who filed to run, the number of women who became their party's nominees for House, Senate and gubernatorial races, and even the number of women running against women in general election races. It’s possible that women could lose seats in the Senate and they may not break the record for the number of women governors. But for the first time in history, Americans could elect more than 100 women to the House, said David Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “That would not be occurring without Donald Trump in the White House,” Wasserman said. “It is a direct reaction to his election.” The majority of those women who ran for House seats – 185 – were Democrats, while 52 were Republicans. About one-third were women of color. Many women would break barriers by winning their races. Among them: Debra Haaland, a Democratic candidate for Congress, listens to a supporter speak at her Albuquerque, New Mexico, headquarters June 4, 2018. (Photo: Russell Contreras, AP) “When you think about what is a representative democracy, making sure that the perspectives and experiences of the entire population are mirrored in those legislative institutions, whether it’s at the state level or the federal level, is important,” said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP). “Those experiences shape the policy priorities of those elected officials.” Currently, 84 women serve as voting House members, including 61 Democrats and 23 Republicans. That has been the record since 2013, according to the Rutgers center. Twenty-three women serve in the Senate, including six Republicans and 17 Democrats. Six women – two Democrats and four Republicans – are governors. During the 1992 “Year of the Woman,” voters elected more new women – 24 – to Congress than in any previous decade, and that record has remained, according to Rutgers. That election followed Professor Anita Hill’s testimony on sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas during his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Democratic Congressional candidate Sharice Davids talks to a volunteer at her campaign office Oct. 1, 2018, in Overland Park, Kansas. (Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP) This year, women have beaten records for winning primaries, from state legislatures to governorships to Congress, according to the CAWP. Their historic involvement follows the massive Women’s March to resist Trump’s presidency and the #MeToo movements’ protest against sexual misconduct in the workplace. Some candidates have shared their own #MeToo movement stories in their campaigns. Others included their children in campaign ads, and in a couple of cases, even breastfed them. Another candidate, Liuba Grechen Shirley, a Long Island Democrat, won approval from the Federal Election Commission to use campaign funds for campaign-related child care expenses. “To me, women win because she ran, whether she actually wins or not,” Walsh said.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2018-senate-election-results-n932546---split---Democrats suffered a blow in their efforts to regain the Senate majority as NBC News projected that Republican challenger Mike Braun will defeat incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. The race has been considered a toss-up because Donnelly was seeking re-election in a state President Donald Trump had won in a landslide in 2016. Trump endorsed Braun and campaigned for him, most recently on Monday. Donnelly's seat was considered a must-hold in order for Democrats to possibly find themselves in the majority next year. As was the story for much of the 2018 cycle, the Senate map presents Democrats with narrow opportunities to regain the majority. Ten Democrats, including Donnelly, were up for re-election in states Trump won, whereas just one Republican was up for re-election in a state that 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won. In Tennessee, a race that at one point looked to be neck-and-neck, NBC News projected that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen. NBC News also projected that Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia would win his re-election battle. Republicans began the day with a 51-49 advantage in Congress' upper chamber as the two parties battle for control of the Senate. In another crucial race, a Democrat finds himself in trouble. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida trails Republican Gov. Rick Scott by a slim margin with more than 95% of the vote in. The race is still too close for NBC News to project. Nelson's seat was also considered to be a must-win for Democrats to take the majority. Polling showed a close race between the two candidates in the run-up to Election Day. Though the map presented Democrats with some obstacles, incumbent Democrats from Rust Belt states Trump won built up substantial polling leads over their GOP opponents. Additionally, Democratic challengers are locked in competitive races out West in Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Earlier in the evening, NBC News projected that Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sherrod Brown of Ohio were re-elected. Based on polling of the races, neither senators' re-election effort was ever in much doubt. Republicans, on the other hand, are geared for possible pickups in states like North Dakota and Missouri. Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL
---split---4.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/no-corporate-pac-pledge-caught-fire---split---Democrat Andy Kim rejected corporate PAC money early on in his campaign. (Simone Pathé/CQ Roll Call) Andy Kim never expected to run for the House. Certainly not against the 19th wealthiest member of Congress. When he was first considering a bid for New Jersey’s 3rd District, the former national security official didn’t like the questions corporate political action committees wanted candidates to answer. Already troubled by money in politics, Kim decided to reject corporate PAC money. It doesn’t sound so revolutionary now, with nearly three-quarters of House Democratic recruits in the year’s most competitive races making the same commitment and still raising buckets of money. But at the time, it was a risky move, and one that concerned people advising Kim. The idea of rejecting corporate PAC money isn’t new — former President Barack Obama did it in 2008, as do a handful of incumbents. What’s unusual this year has been how many House candidates who aren’t self-funders have made the same commitment in competitive races — and just how fast it caught on. Critics offer a simple explanation: It’s easy for challengers to pass up corporate PAC money since they don’t receive much anyway. But with Democrats favored to win the House majority, this informal pledge may soon be something incumbents have to grapple with, too. How We Got Here: The Biggest Surprises in a Campaign Season for the Ages In 2016, just 6 percent of candidates on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue list for top recruits rejected corporate PAC money. This year, 72 percent of Red to Blue candidates — from all ideological factions — have made the same commitment. So what changed? For starters, Democrats started to close the gap between policy and politics when it came to campaign finance. While Democrats believed money in politics should be limited and more transparent, “they still didn’t believe that voters cared at all about this message,” said Tiffany Muller, executive director of End Citizens United, a liberal PAC that supports a campaign finance overhaul. ECU did its own focus groups and polling in early 2017 and discovered voters did care about money in politics. President Donald Trump’s election and his “drain the swamp” mantra tapped into that sentiment. “We weren’t connecting with them in that gut-level way,” said Muller, who would know a thing or two about moving voters. The former deputy political director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was the first openly gay public official in Kansas, where she helped defeat an amendment to the state’s constitution prohibiting gay marriage. ECU found voters didn’t just think money in politics was a problem; they thought it was affecting their day-to-day lives. In other words, it wasn’t just a policy issue, it could be a winning political issue too. The special elections in the first half of 2017 tested that theory. Montana Democrat Rob Quist rejected corporate PAC money and made it a central part of his campaign, which attracted small-dollar fundraising and energized the grassroots in a state Trump won by 20 points. Quist lost that race, but the single-digit margin helped convince Democrats that candidates might not need PAC checks to be competitive fundraisers. ECU started applying that lesson to the midterms that fall, when it rolled out additional House endorsements. Besides Kim, it backed Jason Crow in Colorado, Dean Phillips in Minnesota and Anthony Brindisi in New York, all of whom pledged not to accept corporate PAC money. The group had already endorsed Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has rejected all PAC money but shattered Senate fundraising records anyway. In the first quarter of 2018, some high-profile Democratic senators and 2020 hopefuls rejected corporate PAC money, too, giving the platform more legitimacy. A major boost came when Democrat Conor Lamb won a special election in a Western Pennsylvania district that Trump carried by 20 points. ECU was the first group to endorse Lamb, who also became the first candidate to put his pledge in mailers and in television ads. In ECU surveys after the election, the most common reason voters supported Lamb was his support for Medicare and Social Security, followed by his stance on corporate money. “That was the moment where we were like, ‘Oh yeah, this is a real thing,’” Muller said. Lamb and other candidates have framed their pledge as broader than a campaign finance issue. “Very few people will say to me when I knock on their door that campaign finance reform is their No. 1 issue,” Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin said on a press call with other ECU candidates last month. Voters tell her that politicians care more about the health insurance companies than they do their constituents. But it wasn’t until late spring and summer that this movement caught on in Washington, D.C., and in the press, Muller said, by which time 60 or 70 challengers had already come out against corporate PAC money. These candidates did get pushback from members of Congress — and some still encounter lobbyists who pressure them to go back on their pledges. “I got a lot of angry phone calls from senior Democrats,” Slotkin said. Democratic elected officials told New Jersey’s Tom Malinowski his stance would make the campaign harder. Similarly, Kim was told to consider all the resources he’d be giving up if he won and ran as an incumbent. South Carolina’s Joe Cunningham doesn’t take any PAC money. (He’s had to return checks to ECU.) His own consultants thought he was crazy and starred in a TV ad for him saying as much. But even with so many candidates now rejecting PAC money of some kind, there’s still skepticism amongst some D.C. lobbyists and fundraisers, whose business model depends on incumbents taking the money. Colorado’s Crow has had at least two recent interactions with lobbyists who asked him if he intended to go back on his pledge once he got elected. “It just stuck out to me as frankly everything that’s wrong with our politics right now,” he said. Some candidates, like Malinowski and Crow, confess that they could have raised more money had they accepted corporate PAC money. But others, like Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger, see it as a net benefit. “The amount of people who have donated to my campaign who have never donated in the past has more than made up for money from corporate PACs,” she said on the ECU press call. Democrats certainly haven’t struggled to raise money this year. But it remains to be seen whether that’s sustainable in 2020. “This could really be a problem not this cycle, but next cycle when Democrats have a huge map to defend and a lot of candidates in competitive seats who are leaving a million dollars on the table,” said one Democratic lobbyist, who argued that rejecting corporate PAC cash, which is fully disclosed, shouldn’t necessarily be a priority for overhauling campaign finance. The pledge these candidates have taken is already affecting how campaigns are funded. New York Democrat Max Rose isn’t accepting donations from lobbyists, and both he and Muller predicted that will be the next pledge to spread. Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus’ Democracy Reform Task Force, thinks a longer-term solution is necessary, such as a system to match small donations with public funds, to keep candidates competitive. More than 100 Democratic candidates signed on to a letter last month “to put Congress on notice” and demand that leaders address the issue. But any campaign finance overhaul is unlikely to become law with Republicans expected to hold on to the Senate and with Trump still in the White House. Even if a proposal stalls in a divided Congress, candidates who have rejected corporate PAC money say they will keep their promises. “There’s two options here. One is Max continues to maintain his federal lobbyist and corporate PAC pledge and contribute as a member of Congress,” Rose said. “Or two, Max Rose is no longer a member of Congress.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Mudslinging in New Jersey Senate race getting worse. Fox News’s David Lee Miller has the latest. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is projected to win re-election in New Jersey, defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. Although some Republicans had viewed Menendez as vulnerable due to a 2017 federal corruption trial, the 12-year Senate veteran never trailed Hugin in pre-election polling. Menendez fended off his wealthy Republican challenger and a barrage of ads about his tossed-out corruption charges to win re-election. FULL MIDTERMS RESULTS Menendez, 64, secured a third term Tuesday after a grueling campaign against Republican Bob Hugin. Polls showed Hugin, 64, and Menendez much closer than expected in overwhelmingly Democratic New Jersey. Hugin tapped his deep pockets for at least $27.5 million and spent on TV ads attacking Menendez over the 2017 trial on charges that he helped a friend with Medicare billing in exchange for lavish gifts. Bob Hugin, the Republican challenger for Bob Menendez's seat in the U.S. Senate, speaks during a debate with the Democratic candidate, Sen. Bob Menendez, in Newark, N.J. in October (AP) The charges were dropped this year after a mistrial. MIDTERMS LIVE BLOG The race was particularly significant because Democrats are defending 26 seats, including 10 incumbents running in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016. Voters in the Garden State settled a closely watched Senate contest between the Democratic incumbent and the Republican Hugin, who previously served as CEO of the drug maker Celgene. They also voted for representatives in New Jersey's dozen House races. Menendez secured his third term among six other candidates who were also on the ballot. Voters also weighed in on a $500 million education bond issue. President Donald Trump endorsed Hugin in blue New Jersey's Senate contest, leading Menendez to tweet out his gratitude. The president said Tuesday that Hugin would be a "Great Senator." Hugin has kept his distance from Trump, who's unpopular in New Jersey. He even said during the campaign that he's not a "Trump Republican." Menendez campaigned in part on Trump's unpopularity and said Hugin would be a "rubber stamp" for the president. In response to the president's tweet, Menendez tweeted, "Thank you." The Associated Press contributed to this story.

Results from the NBC News Exit Poll show that these voters broke heavily for the Democrats in the race for Congress, with 72 percent of these voters casting a ballot for the Democratic House candidate in their districts while just 26 percent supported the Republican. Those who voted for third-party candidates in 2016 also swung to the Democrats in 2018, though by a smaller margin, 57 percent to 40 percent. Not surprisingly, those who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 overwhelmingly supported Democratic House candidates; Trump voters were similarly loyal to Republican candidates. NBC News estimates that Democrats have a 65 percent chance of taking control of the House. Across the country voters are reporting broken machines, long lines, and other problems with casting their ballot, forcing some polling locations to extend their hours. One in 4 Latino voters said today was their first time voting in a midterm election, according to exit polls.  Florida's Amendment 4 passed on Tuesday night, giving an estimated 1.5 million Floridians their voting rights back. The Constitutional amendment — which needed at least 60 percent of the vote to pass — will automatically restore voting rights to ex-felons who have completed their sentences. Those convicted of murder or sex crimes are not eligible for rights restoration under the bill. Florida is one of four states that bans felons from voting permanently — unless they can get clemency from the state — and the law disproportionately affects minorities, who are convicted at higher rates. The amendment is part of a national trend that seeks to restore voting rights to ex-felons. The incumbent Democratic senator's race against Republican Josh Hawley is too close to call, NBC News projects. Republican Marsha Blackburn has defeated Democrat Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race, NBC News projects. With 42 percent of the vote in the state tallied, Blackburn, a Republican congresswoman representing a largely rural district, had 62.1 percent, while Bredesen, a former governor, had 36.7 percent. Bredesen and Blackburn were vying to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker and were close in recent polls. Blackburn, throughout her campaign, had relied heavily on tying herself closely to President Donald Trump, who visited the state three times this fall to campaign for her. Voters are closely divided on the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election. According to NBC News Exit Poll results, 42 percent of voters nationwide approve Mueller's handling of the investigation, while 45 percent disapprove. There's a partisan divide — about six in 10 Democrats approve of Mueller's handling of the probe, compared to just two in 10 Republicans. Independents are divided, with 43 percent approving and 42 percent disapproving. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has won re-election, beating his Republican challenger, State Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, NBC News projects. Manchin has a strong personal brand in the state and had been running ads touting his independence and underscoring his support for gun rights and veterans. Still, West Virginia is one of the most pro-Trump states in the country. Manchin voted for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but only after it was apparent that he’d be confirmed. The Democrats have a 65 percent chance of taking control of the House, according to an NBC News estimate. NBC estimates the Democrats will win 224 seats, plus or minus 16 seats. A party needs to control 218 seats in the House for a majority. Republican Rep. Andy Barr has won re-election in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, beating Democratic challenger Amy McGrath, according to NBC News. McGrath, a former Marine pilot who was the first woman to fly in an F-18 combat mission, was seeking to defeat the GOP incumbent in the highly competitive race in the Lexington-area district. That district picked Donald Trump by 16 points in 2016. NBC News considers this race one of the bellwethers that will determine House control. NBC "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd says that the Republican win in Virginia's 5th Congressional District is good news for the GOP, as a loss there would have meant a "tsunami." "That was our tsunami-watch race in Virginia. It's an open seat, a Republican district. Leslie Cockburn there is a longtime, progressive journalist," Todd said in reference to the Democratic candidate. "Had that flipped, you would be looking at something we've never seen before on the Democratic side. That is a sigh of relief for Republicans." When it comes to control of the House, "this could be a knife fight tonight," Todd said.

For Republicans, “This could be a knife fight, tonight. We’ll see.” pic.twitter.com/nKWtHpGCTj GOP challenger Mike Braun has defeated incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in the Indiana Senate race, NBC News projects. With 56 percent of the vote in the Hoosier State tallied, Braun was beating Donnelly 54.9 percent to 41.0 percent. Polls in recent days had shown a dead heat between Donnelly and Braun, a former businessman and member of the Indiana State House. Braun's win for the GOP gives the party a wider cushion as it seeks to maintain its control of the Senate. One out of every six voters nationwide casting ballots in 2018 said that they were voting in a midterm election for the first time, according to results from today’s NBC News Exit Poll. Among this group of voters new to midterm elections, Democrats and independents far outnumbered Republicans, who made up just a quarter of those who said they’d never voted in a midterm election before. This is in part because Democrats tend to be younger and thus more likely to be new voters, while independents tend to be less frequent voters and thus less likely to have voted previously in a midterm election.

This year’s allegations come by way of the Georgia governor's race, in a closely watched contest between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. Posts on Twitter and Facebook — some with thousands of engagements — have alleged Abrams-supporting, armed Black Panthers have been walking through polling places in Georgia and threatening voters. There is no evidence for such a claim, but the misinformation stems from a report published in Breitbart over the weekend that went viral, attracting 95,000 engagements, according to social analytics tool BuzzSumo. Kemp linked to Breitbart's article in a tweet from his official account on Sunday. That report took photos from the Georgia New Black Panther Party’s Facebook page that showed a few of the armed men posing with Stacey Abrams’ signs on the streets of Atlanta. The fear-baiting is reminiscent of Election Day 2008 in which two members of the New Black Panther Party, one carrying a nightstick, were recorded standing outside a Philadelphia polling place. That video became the subject of over nearly 100 Fox News segments and two Department of Justice investigations. Facebook has also squashed rumors on its platform that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents would be patrolling polling places, checking IDs and making arrests of undocumented immigrants attempting to vote. ICE dispelled such rumors last month, tweeting that the agency “does not patrol or conduct enforcement operations at polling locations. Any flyers or advertisements claiming otherwise are false,” ICE wrote on Twitter. ProPublica described the ICE rumors as another recurring piece of disinformation that “cropped up intermittently over the past two years." A Facebook spokesman told NBC News that its War Room had been monitoring posts, with assistance from the Department of Homeland Security and state elections directors. As part of that effort, Facebook had taken down multiple posts that falsely claimed ICE was patrolling polling places. They also took down “several” posts aimed at voter suppression including ones that urged voters to head to polls on nonelection days.  Billionaire hotelier J.B.

Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced the end of the U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, as the administration restored a network of sanctions on the regime. Rich Edson explains on 'Special Report.' As the full slate of US-imposed sanctions on Iran kicks back into effect on Monday – as a consequence of the Trump administration pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in May – civil unrest is expected to only deepen across the economically embattled nation. But from the vantage point of several Iranian women long opposed to the reigning religious regime, such unrest and protest is the only way to bring about change; even if it means life on the run as a labeled “terrorist.” Trump administration targets banking and shipping sectors; Rich Edson reports from the State Department. President Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday that members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen's civil war "didn't know how to use" an American-made bomb when they blew up a school bus this past August, killing dozens of children. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended the White House’s move last week to reimpose sanctions against Iran amid criticism from some conservatives that the action does not go far enough to cripple the country’s economy. The Trump administration announces the remaining sanctions that were lifted as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal will be re-imposed on Monday; insight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A U.S. service member has been killed and another wounded in an apparent insider attack in Kabul Saturday. Secretary of State Pompeo says the administration is targeting the core of the regime's economy as it essentially ends participation in the Iran nuclear deal. Rich Edson explains for 'Special Report.' Brazilian right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said Thursday that he will move Brazil’s embassy is Israel to Jerusalem -- following a similar move by President Donald Trump last year.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/midterm-elections-2018-misinformation-voting-hoaxes/---split---Election Day is a perfect environment for misinformation to spread, whether it’s through coordinated campaigns or honest error—or a mix of both. The stakes are high, there’s a lot of breaking news, and the US voting system isn’t always the most intuitive. Social media didn’t create misinformation, but as Emily Dreyfuss wrote last week, it can certainly add fuel to the fire. And the 2018 midterms have been, as the kids say, lit. WIRED will update this page throughout Election Day to track the biggest stories, the most common hoaxes, and the likeliest sources of confusion as they emerge online. If you’re looking for ways to follow the election results tonight, Pia Ceres has you covered here. And most important of all, go vote! Late Monday night, Facebook announced it had identified dozens of accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “may be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior” after US law enforcement alerted the company to some online activity they believe might be linked to foreign entities. So far, the company says it has blocked around 30 Facebook accounts, whose associated pages were mostly in French and Russian, and 85 Instagram accounts, which were mostly in English and covered a mix of celebrities and politics. The company says it will investigate further. “Typically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in a post announcing the action. “But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the US, we wanted to let people know about the action we’ve taken and the facts as we know them today.” The news comes a little over a week after Facebook took down another coordinated network; that one, which the company said originated in Iran, appeared to follow the playbook Russian trolls perfected during the 2016 election: posing as US citizens to drive engagement around divisive social issues and national events. As of Tuesday morning, the company had not identified any foreign entities connected to the blocked accounts. There’s no outright deception here, but plenty of room for misunderstanding. On Monday, the CBP announced that it would engage in a “mobile field force demonstration,” showing off its crowd control expertise—in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in El Paso, on Election Day. After civil rights groups expressed concerns that the exercise could double as voter intimidation, the Texas Civil Rights Project confirmed that CBP called it off an hour before the scheduled start time. So if you see reports about the CBP potentially intimidating voters in Texas senate candidate Beto O'Rourke's backyard, know that they’re outdated—but only as of very recently. The race for governor of Georgia, between sitting Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp and Democratic former state representative Stacey Abrams, has become one of the dirtiest contests in the nation. Kemp, who as secretary of state oversees Georgia's voter rolls, has been accused of systematically disenfranchising people, particularly African Americans. Over the weekend, he accused the Democratic Party of hacking without citing evidence. And on Monday, Kemp, who is white, engaged in racial fear-mongering, tweeting that “The Black Panther Party is backing my opponent. RT if you think Abrams is TOO EXTREME for Georgia!” Abrams is African American, as is 30.2 percent of the state, according to the US Census. https://twitter.com/BrianKempGA/status/1059581337554898944 The tweet linked to a Breitbart article, which took an image, posted to Facebook by a group identifying itself as The New Black Panther Party, of a small “armed rally against voter disenfranchisement” held on November 3. The article compares that rally, which appeared to have no more than five Black Panthers in attendance based on a review of 22 photos the group put on Facebook, to the thousand-person-plus rally Trump held for Kemp that same night. Kemp’s supporters are using the same images to claim that Black Panthers are intimidating voters at the polls. One post shared in a Facebook group called Trump Train, which has more than 54,000 members, urged people to call police if they saw Black Panthers at the polls: “Black Panthers, a radicalized-racist militant group, are armed with assult weapons roaming the streets and neighborhoods as well as the voting polls in Georgia to intimidate and 'persuade' Voters to vote for the far-left democrat candidate, Stacey Abrams for Governor.” The New Black Panthers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But it is clear that these images have been taken by Kemp’s supporters out of context—they do not show armed individuals at the polls in Georgia, but rather a small gathering that happened on Saturday on a street corner in Atlanta. Various alarmed citizens are claiming that George Soros owns Smartmatic voting machines, and will use them to tip the election to the favor of Democrats in 16 states. “ALERT: On Election Day if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand request a paper ballot. SOROS owns SmartMatic brand,” a typical entreaty starts. It’s a rumor that has circulated since at least 2012, found oxygen in conservative media in 2016, and is untrue. As Snopes points out, the chairman of UK-based Smartmatic does sit on the board of Soros’s Open Society Foundation, but the connections end there. And even if you still thought Soros was using that loose affiliation to somehow alter votes, the fact is that zero US precincts are using Smartmatic voting machines this year. They didn’t in 2016, either. So if your voting machine is a Smartmatic brand, don’t request a paper ballot. Buy a plane ticket back home to the US, and go to your actual polling place. On Monday, MSNBC erroneously ran a graphic showing results for the Florida gubernatorial race… a day before voting had even begun. The fake tally had Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum leading Republican Ron DeSantis by .6 percentage points, with 99 percent of the votes reported as counted. https://twitter.com/SethMc74/status/1059615391100649473 The network quickly owned up to its mistake. All In host Chris Hayes clarified shortly after that the seemingly prophetic graphic was caused by a system error, which “inadvertently populated some test numbers” on-screen. “Obviously, we do not yet have any vote totals here, the night before the election,” said Hayes. “That was a misfire. Don’t worry. I was pretty confused when I saw it up there, to see it myself.” Regardless, the image is currently circulating on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Voat, and other platforms as “evidence” the election is rigged. “Soros has rigged the election outcome in Florida and MSNBC already got the results,” reads one post on pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald with over 2,800 upvotes. Tweets from far-right commentators like Pamela Geller, Jack Posobiac and Jim Hoft have only further muddied the waters. The same falsehood pops up every election: that noncitizens are voting in vast numbers. This is not, and has never been true, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which looked into the issue after President Trump claimed millions of non-citizens cast illegal votes in the 2016 election and found less than 50 cases nationwide. But in 2018, it remains a popular far-right conspiracy theory, playing into fears of illegal immigration. (According to Google Trends, “immigration” has been the second-most searched for election topic this week.) The misinformation this year has come from elected officials and average Americans alike. President Trump tweeted that he’d told law enforcement to watch out for illegal voting, but ProPublica found that no law enforcement agency would confirm that they'd been contacted about it. Georgia Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp sent out a robocall saying his opponent Stacey Abrams wanted undocumented immigrants to vote. A meme circulating on Facebook urges Republican voters in mostly-Democratic California to “Vote Red in California—offset one vote by an illegal alien.” Well-known conservative writer Larry Schweikart falsely claimed that Democratic Senate Candidate Beto O’Rourke is paying “illegals” in Texas to vote for him against incumbent Ted Cruz. https://twitter.com/LarrySchweikart/status/1059848001579929600 Project Veritas' James O'Keefe published a video on Twitter Tuesday that claims to prove widespread illegal voting by non citizens, when what it actually shows is an ill-informed poll worker who appears to not know what DACA or Dreamers are. The poll worker informs the "undercover journalist" in the video that if a person is registered to vote, they can vote–despite the person taking the video telling them that the registered voter in question is a Dreamer. However, if a person is not a citizen, they can't register. The video was later tweeted by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, though he admitted he hadn't verified if it was accurate.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-signal-cabinet-staff-changes-midterms---split---President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he likes his cabinet “for the most part,” but changes might be coming after the midterms. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump signaled Monday he expects Cabinet and staff changes after Tuesday’s midterms, but stopped short of saying embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke might be ousted amid corruption charges. He also said he intends to name a nominee to replace Nikki Haley as UN ambassador by the end of the week. (He leaves Friday for a Armistice Day visit to Paris.) “Administrations make changes usually after midterms,” Trump told reporters traveling with him on a three-state tour to wrap his 2018 campaigning. “No timeline” He likes the members of his Cabinet, “for the most part,” he said, according to a pool report. Asked about Zinke, Trump resounded: “He’s done a good job” but added he plans to will “take a look” at the allegations of wrongdoing.

---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-border-patrol-conducts-crowd-control-training-exercise/story?id=58997450---split---Border patrol officials on Tuesday abruptly canceled a "crowd control exercise" it had planned for Election Day near a Hispanic neighborhood along the Texas-Mexico border a half a mile from a polling place. The event, which had been scheduled for noon Eastern time, drew sharp criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union and others that said the timing seemed to be aimed at trying to intimidate Hispanic voters. The Trump administration and border officials sharply rejected that allegation, saying the exercise was preparation for the potential influx of migrants who have been traveling north through Mexico. In a statement released to reporters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had canceled the event "out of an abundance of caution and due to inaccurate reporting that caused unneeded confusion in border communities." CBP said it would continue training exercises in coming days "as necessary to ensure border security and the safety of the American people." "The timing of this is suspicious," the ACLU in Texas tweeted. "The Trump administration, and by extension the (Texas Gov. Greg) Abbott administration, have done quite enough to intimidate voters without staging military rehearsals on Election Day."  The timing of this is suspicious. The Trump administration, and by extension the Abbott administration, have done quite enough to intimidate voters without staging military rehearsals on Election Day. https://t.co/8nWiPZxS7Y #ElPaso #ElectionDay  Tyler Q. Houlton, press secretary for the Homeland Security Department, issued a statement prior to the event's cancellation insisting that the exercise was appropriate and not tied to Election Day. "The suggestion that ongoing exercises at ports of entry in anticipation of a potential mass arrival of migrants are tied to voting by any group is flat-out wrong," he said in a statement. "DHS has worked tirelessly to ensure the security of our election systems and will always secure our borders regardless of what day it might be.”     Border patrol officials in Texas had invited media to witness the training exercise, which was scheduled to take place at a railroad crossing west of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry. The site of the training exercise would have been a half a mile away from the Armijo Recreation Center, a polling station in El Paso. The exercise was planned as President Donald Trump also deployed thousands of active-duty service members to the border in response to a caravan of migrants from Central America moving through Mexico. Caravan participants interviewed by ABC News have said they are fleeing poverty and crime and are seeking asylum in the United States; Trump has described the slow-moving group as "invaders" and a national security threat, urging them to return home or settle in Mexico. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat looking to unseat Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said he didn't understand why anyone would be angry with asylum seekers "doing what any human being would do." "No walls, no CBP exercises (are) going to keep us from honoring our laws, our commitments" to process asylum applications, O'Rourke told reporters late Monday. "Why this is happening now, why the president is stirring these issues up at this moment with 24 hours before we decide this election - I'll leave that to you to conclude."   When asked about training exercises on Election Day, a CBP spokesman in Texas had said border patrol officials were monitoring the caravan and making the "necessary preparations." "These include participating in operational readiness exercises and the mobilization of resources to ensure the facilitation of lawful trade and travel," he said. Immigration activists and the ACLU say the migrant caravan represents a humanitarian crisis, not a national security threat. "Instead of practicing to handle nonexistent crowds, the Border Patrol could practice something useful and timely: how to properly interview and process refugee asylum seekers,” the ACLU's executive director in Texas, Terri Burke, told The Washington Post.
---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2018-midterm-elections/story?id=58584336---split---Today is Election Day, and many Americans have already voted in what could be very eventful midterm elections. There are 20 states where voters were able to cast their ballots ahead of time, having their say on what may be a changing of the guard in many gubernatorial, Senate and House races. Here are answers to some of the most burning questions about the 2018 midterms:  On Election Day, there is a strict quarantine on any news coming from the early waves of exit-poll data until 5 p.m. ET. By about 5:45 p.m., some initial demographic information about voter turnout will be available on ABCNews.com. Winners will not be projected until polls are closed, so announcements come on a state-by-state basis as individual state polls close. Information will be constantly updated throughout the evening on ABCNews.com and on all ABC News programs.  All times are in ET. 7 p.m. -- Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia 7:30 p.m. -- North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia 8 p.m. -- Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Tennessee 8:30 p.m. -- Arkansas 9 p.m. -- Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming 10 p.m. -- Iowa, Montana, Nevada and Utah 11 p.m. -- California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon and Washington 1 a.m. -- Alaska  Going into the midterms, the Republicans have control of both houses of Congress. Democrats are hoping that through a few critical elections they're able to shift the balance of power in one or both houses.   In the House of Representatives, all 435 seats are up for election. In order to take control of the House, Democrats need a net gain of at least 23 seats. That said, there are several House seats currently held by Democrats that Republicans have been eyeing, including in Missouri, North Dakota and Florida. In the Senate, 35 seats are up for grabs. Democrats would need a net gain of two seats to take control. Several currently held by Republicans will see tight races, including in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Mississippi.    Midterm elections are to some extent always seen as a referendum on the current administration and party in power. This year is no different. Because Republicans control of both the executive branch, led by Donald Trump, and the legislative branch, holding both the Senate and the House, many voters see the midterms as a chance to either show their support for or disapproval of Trump and his administration’s agenda. That was the case during President Barack Obama's presidency when Republicans made massive gains in both the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. A similar trend was seen in the second midterm election during President George W. Bush’s administration, as Democrats picked up seats in 2006. This followed the trend's having been bucked in 2002 when Republicans actually gained seats.    The president has been hitting the campaign trail in support of Republicans in tight races, including Kentucky incumbent Rep. Andy Barr. Trump's also been to Mississippi on behalf of Cindy Hyde-Smith's Senate bid. The president made a "western swing" through Montana, Arizona and Nevada, on behalf of Republican candidates.   If the Republicans lose control of the House, it won't be Trump's fault, according to Trump. "No," the president told The Associated Press on Oct. 16, "I think I'm helping people. I think we’re going to do well. Look, it feels to me very much like '16. I was going out and making speeches, and I was getting tens of thousands of people."    Of the 100 seats in the Senate, 35 are contested. Some of the most-closely watched are instances where, if the Democrats take over seats currently held by Republicans, including Ted Cruz, that could flip the balance of power. Inversely, there are two Democratic senators, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill, facing Republican opponents who could tip the scales the other way. One of the tightest Senate races is in Arizona, as Republican Rep. Martha McSally and Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema are battling for the seat left open by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake's decision to not seek re-election.    Every House seat, which carries a two-year term, is open -- and many will prove to be nail-biters. One of the most closely watched is in Kentucky, with Republican Andy Barr and Democrat Amy McGrath are in a tight race. Barr is a former congressional staffer and a lawyer by trade, while McGrath is a former Marine Corps pilot who's never before run for office.   Another is in Pennsylvania, as Conor Lamb made national headlines when he kickstarted Democrats' blue-wave ambitions with an upset win in a special election in March. But come November, he's poised to face even stiffer competition from the incumbent Republican, Rep. Keith Rothfus.  There are 36 governors who are facing a big verdict on Election Day. The race in Florida has reached fever pitch, as Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis squares off with Democrat Andrew Gillum. The race may be etched in the national audience’s mind for disturbing reasons following racism accusations against DeSantis, which he's denied, following Gillum's primary victory.  It depends on your state. Voter registration deadlines range from 30 days before Election Day to the day of. Utah and Connecticut had one of the latest deadlines, as voters could register up to just a week before Election Day. That said, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming are places that cater to procrastinators, as those states allow people to register to vote and cast a ballot -- not an absentee ballot -- on Election Day. And of course, there's an exception to all of this, as North Dakota doesn't have voter registration requirements.    Again, it depends on where you live. As of Oct. 18, voting had already begun in 20 states.   In those situations, which vary by state, ballots often are sent to registered voters who can mail them back or hand deliver them to a polling location or board of elections. In some place, early voting has wrapped up. So you'll have to head to the polls in those states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and North Carolina.  A whole lot. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, this election cycle is expected to be the first time midterms have hit the $5 billion mark.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018-midterm-nail-biter-battle-for-control-of-congress-hinges-on-dozens-of-airtight-toss-ups---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Situation rooms flagging incidents, identifying trends and developing responses; Catherine Herridge reports on the security framework. America could be in for a long night of returns. Democrats for months have been favored by forecasters to win control of the House, where they need to net 23 seats to secure a majority. In the Senate, Republicans are cautiously optimistic they will hold onto – or even add seats to – their slim 51-49 majority. But in both chambers, the sheer number of airtight toss-up races means there are no guarantees about tonight’s outcome, even as generic congressional ballots show Democrats with the advantage over Republicans and the party of the president historically loses seats in their first midterm elections. “Like it or not, every president in a midterm election is on the ballot,” former George W. Bush aide Karl Rove said Tuesday on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” “This is a referendum on the party in power.” In the House, the Fox News Power Rankings reflect 29 “toss-up” races. The Cook Political Report, which predicted a gain of 30 to 40 Democratic seats in a majority-seizing night, also lists 30 House contests as “toss-ups.” Both parties have a chance, if only a slim one, for an upset in the respective chambers where they're playing as underdogs. “Republicans would likely need to win 23 of the 30 toss-up races to keep their [House] majority,” Cook Political Report editor David Wasserman said. “That's not impossible, but it's very difficult.” The airtight House contests are scattered across the country: Among them, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is challenging Republican Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District; Democrat Danny O'Connor and Republican Troy Balderson are rematching in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District; and Democrat Harley Rouda is challenging longtime Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in California’s 48th Congressional District. ELECTION DAY ARRIVES: WHAT’S AT STAKE IN MIDTERM BATTLES FOR CONGRESS, GOVERNORSHIPS In the Senate, where Democrats need to net two seats, there are five toss-ups, though the map is harder for them because of the large number of incumbent Democrats running for re-election in states won by Trump in 2016. But the closeness of the toss-up races -- Republican Sen. Dean Heller versus Democrat Jacky Rosen in Nevada; Democrat Kyrsten Sinema versus Republican Martha McSally in Arizona; Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill versus Republican Josh Hawley in Missouri; Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly versus Republican Mike Braun in Indiana; and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson versus Republican Rick Scott in Florida -- indicates that Democrats do have a small chance of taking the Senate. Democrats would need all five of those races to go their way presuming they hold the seats they're expected to, plus pick up a seat in a longshot like Texas or Tennessee or Mississippi to claim a majority. Either way, election watchers who want to see which party wins control of Congress probably won’t be going to bed early tonight. The first polls, on the East Coast, close at 7 p.m. ET. After polls on the West Coast close at 11 p.m. ET, the last will close in Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. Whether they flip the House or not, Democrats are still expected to gain seats in the chamber, given the favorable political environment for Democrats. Ahead of the vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi confidently predicted last week that Democrats would indeed win back the House. “Let me say this. Up until today, I would’ve said, ‘If the election were held today, we would win,’” Pelosi said on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” last week. “What now I’m saying is, ‘We will win.’” In the end, the elections will go one of three ways: Republicans hold both chambers, Democrats take the majority in both, or the parties split the House and Senate. Either of the latter two scenarios would be problematic for Trump, immediately putting a damper on his agenda. Should Democrats re-take the House, there are signs some in the conference may launch a push to impeach the president – though the leadership has not yet backed the effort. Pelosi has said impeachment is "not a priority," at least not until Special Counsel Robert Mueller announces the conclusions of his probe into the Trump administration's alleged dealings with Russia. Trump, though, almost assuredly will face an avalanche of investigations into his tax returns, his payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and his relationship with Russia if Democrats win back the House – which comes with the much-coveted power to subpoena and launch congressional investigations. A number of prominent anti-Trump Democrats also would be poised to assume control of key committees if Republicans lose control of the House. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., likely would be elevated to chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, where she currently serves as ranking member. Another top California Democratic representative, Adam Schiff, would likely rise to chair the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member. And Pelosi would look to regain the speakership. Trump himself has been campaigning non-stop in recent days, telling voters they must keep Democrats from taking back control of the House and Senate, or his agenda could be in jeopardy.

---split---6.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-birthright-threat-pelosi/story?id=58867579---split---President Donald Trump shocked the country on Tuesday when he said he'd try using an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismissed the claim as a baseless scare tactic. "Well, this is just more of the same of what he has been saying, taking babies out of the arms of their moms, putting them in cages, warning about a caravan that's over 1,000 miles away," Pelosi said on "The Late Show" Tuesday. "What he was saying today has no relationship to what his authority is. But that's, of course, not unusual." Pelosi, D-Calif., said it would be unconstitutional to rescind birthright citizenship through an executive order.   "I just can't even imagine what our founders would be thinking to see a president to take an oath of office to protect and defend the constitution of the United States, and then abuse that," Pelosi said. "This is what this is the election is about -- checks and balances. A check and balance on this president."   Trump said children born in the U.S. to non-citizens or undocumented immigrants shouldn't be granted citizenship, and he said he wants to change the law unilaterally.  On #LSSC tonight: Leader @NancyPelosi responds to Donald Trump's threat to end birthright citizenship: "this is just more of the same." pic.twitter.com/maNClK8kQU  "We're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States," Trump told Axios in an interview that aired Tuesday. "It's ridiculous. And it has to end. "It's in the process. It'll happen ... with an executive order."   Trump received a lot of pushback from lawmakers on both sides after making the comments, but Pelosi said it gave her party a big boost of optimism leading into next week’s midterms. When asked how she was "feeling about the next six days," Pelosi said: “Well, let me say this: Up until today, I would have said if the election were held today, we would win. Now I'm saying we will win." The White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News on Tuesday about Trump's proposed executive order.
---split---6.0---split---http://pewresearch.tumblr.com/---split---Liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media to mobilize others or find like-minded groups. Some 44% of liberal Democrats say they have used these sites in the past year to encourage others to take action on an issue that was important to them, while a similar share (43%) have taken part in a group that shares their interest in a cause. These shares fall to around a third or fewer among conservative or moderate Democrats and among conservative, moderate or liberal Republicans. Large majorities of registered voters backing Democrats (77%) and those supporting Republicans (82%) expect their party to hold a House majority after the elections. But Republicans are more bullish than Democrats about Senate control: 87% of Republican voters expect the GOP to hold a Senate majority; 62% of Democratic voters expect their party to have the majority. Two-thirds of Americans (67%) say everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote, but Republicans – especially conservative Republicans – are less likely to hold this view. Some 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, and this is particularly true in lower-income households. This aspect of the digital divide – often referred to as the “homework gap” – can be an academic burden for teens. Black teens, as well as those from lower-income households, are especially likely to face these school-related challenges as a result. Younger adults in the U.S. are better able than older adults to distinguish factual statements from opinion statements, according to a survey conducted earlier this year in which respondents were asked to categorize five factual statements and five opinion statements. Younger adults are not only better overall at correctly identifying factual and opinion news statements – they can do so regardless of the ideological appeal of the statements. A growing share of U.S. adults – including majorities in both parties – say drug addiction is a very big problem in the country today. Increasing shares of Americans also cite the affordability of college and sexism as very big problems. Partisans differ over the seriousness of many other problems, including the gap between the rich and poor and gun violence. There were nearly 5 million English language learners in U.S. public schools in fall 2015, representing 9.5% of enrollees. These students are a diverse group from many different states and native language backgrounds. A new interactive shows Spanish is by far the most common language they speak at home, but other languages are common, too. Spanish is the most common language spoken at home for ELL students, but not in all states. Roughly three-quarters of students with limited English proficiency in U.S. public schools (77%) said they spoke Spanish as their primary language at home in 2015. Although only 2% of ELL students nationwide speak Arabic at home, the share is greater in some states, such as Michigan, where 24% speak it. Brazilians will vote Sunday in a runoff presidential election. In a survey conducted this spring, 9% of Brazilians described the current economic situation in their country as good, even lower than the share (15%) who said this in 2017. A plurality of 43% said the financial situation of average Brazilians is worse than it was 20 years ago, and about half (53%) said children in Brazil will be financially worse off than their parents when they grow up. Voting is compulsory in Brazil: It is one of a handful of countries where at least nine-in-ten people say they have voted in the past. Photo: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images Half of U.S. Latinos say their situation in the country has worsened over the past year, up from 32% in the weeks after the 2016 election and the highest level since the Great Recession. More say they have serious concerns about their place in America today and a majority worry that they, a family member or close friend could be deported. Many blame the current administration for what they see as the worsening situation of Hispanics, the nation’s largest minority group. Two-thirds (67%) say the administration’s policies have been harmful to Hispanics – a much higher share than during the administration of either Democrat Barack Obama (15% in 2010) or Republican George W. Bush (41% in 2007). Overall, six-in-ten Hispanics (62%) say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today, up since 2017 and the highest level since the Great Recession a decade ago, when 70% of Hispanics said they were dissatisfied with the nation’s direction. And yet, attitudes among Latinos are not monolithic. Slightly less than a quarter of Latinos (23%) identify as Republican or describe themselves as leaning Republican. Among this group, six-in-ten (59%) approve of President Trump’s job performance, compared with just 8% of Latino Democrats who say the same.3 In addition, half as many Latino Republicans as Latino Democrats (28% vs. 57%) say the Hispanic population’s situation has grown worse over the past year. Notably, partisan differences do not extend to voting. In each partisan camp, about six-in-ten (59%) registered voters say they are more enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterms than in the last congressional elections. This year, more than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote, up from 25 million in 2014. The movement for a $15-an-hour minimum wage got a boost earlier this month when Amazon – which has drawn criticism for its pay practices and working conditions – announced it would raise its base pay for all U.S. workers to $15 an hour. The new minimum wage takes effect Nov. 1 and will affect some 250,000 full- and part-time employees, as well as the 100,000 or so seasonal workers Amazon expects to hire in the next few months, according to the company. (The raises will be offset, at least in part, by the phasing out of bonuses and stock awards for hourly workers.) How much of a real improvement those workers will see in their daily lives, however, depends very much on where they live. More than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote nationwide in 2018, making up 12.8% of all eligible voters – both new highs. The pool of eligible Hispanic voters has steadily grown in recent years. Between 2014 and 2018, an additional 4 million Hispanics became eligible voters (U.S. citizens ages 18 and older). Much of this growth has been driven by young U.S.-born Hispanics coming of age. Since 2014, around 3 million have turned 18. Other sources of growth include Hispanic immigrant naturalizations – among Mexicans alone, 423,000 became U.S. citizens from 2014 to 2017 – as well as residents of Puerto Rico moving to one of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, especially Florida. The Latino voter turnout rate in midterm elections has declined since 2006. In 2014, the turnout rate among Latino eligible voters dropped to a record low of 27.0%. (White and Asian eligible voters also had record-low turnout rates.) Despite this, a record 6.8 million Latinos voted. Young Latinos have contributed to this low voter turnout. In 2014, just 16.0% of eligible Latinos ages 18 to 35 voted, compared with 36.2% of Latinos 36 and older. At the same time, younger Latinos make up a large share of the Hispanic electorate. About 43.5% of all Hispanic eligible voters in 2018 are 18 to 35 years old, compared with 30.6% of all U.S. eligible voters. Hispanics also account for a significant share of young eligible voters nationwide. Hispanics make up about a fifth (18.1%) of all U.S. eligible voters ages 18 to 35, but just 10.4% of eligible voters ages 36 and older. America’s global image today is complicated. On balance, people around the world continue to give the United States favorable ratings and say it respects the individual liberties of its people. More countries also prefer the U.S. as the world’s leading power over China. At the same time, many express frustration about America’s role in the world and say they have little confidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing in world affairs, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 25 nations. Here are nine charts that show how people in these countries see the U.S. and its president: Western Europeans have strikingly negative views of Trump. In the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain – four nations the Center has consistently surveyed over the past 15 years – there is a clear pattern in public perceptions of U.S. presidents. People in these countries generally had little confidence in President George W. Bush to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Their confidence was much higher in Bush’s successor, President Barack Obama, but it plunged following Trump’s election in 2016. This year, confidence in Trump remains low in Germany, France and Spain – but it is up slightly in the UK. Of the 25 countries surveyed, a median of 70% lack confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Views of the U.S. are favorable on balance, but concerns are evident. Across the 25 countries surveyed, a median of 50% have a favorable opinion of the U.S., while 43% have an unfavorable view. Likewise, a median of 51% say the U.S. respects the personal freedoms of its people, compared with 37% who say it does not. However, there is international concern about America’s role in world affairs. Large majorities say the U.S. doesn’t take the interests of other countries into account when making foreign policy decisions.

Yet there continue to be several policy proposals that draw broad support from both parties. Overwhelming majorities of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Democrats and Democratic leaners (89% each) say mentally ill people should be barred from buying guns. Nearly as many in both parties (86% of Democrats, 83% of Republicans) favor barring gun purchases by people on federal watch lists. And sizable majorities also favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks (91% of Democrats, 79% of Republicans). Yet there is a 30-percentage-point difference between Democrats and Republicans in support for an assault weapons ban (81% of Democrats, 50% of Republicans) and even wider gaps on two other proposals: arming teachers and school officials in elementary and high schools and allowing people to carry concealed weapons in more places. Today, Canada became the second country to legalize recreational marijuana. In the United States, about six-in-ten Americans (62%) say the use of marijuana should be legalized, reflecting a steady increase over the past decade. Majorities of Millennials (74%), Gen Xers (63%) and Baby Boomers (54%) say the use of marijuana should be legal. Members of the Silent Generation continue to be the least supportive of legalization (39%). Nearly seven-in-ten Democrats (69%) say marijuana use should be legal. Republicans are divided, with 45% in favor of legalizing marijuana and 51% opposed.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Former FBI Director James Comey now faces a possible subpoena after rejecting a request by the House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door interview; Comey's lawyer says he wants to testify in public. Former FBI director James Comey wrote in an op-ed Tuesday he believes an anti-Trump “awakening” is underway in America, as social media posts showed the outspoken President Trump critic campaigning for Democrats on Election Day. “I feel the giant stirring,” Comey wrote in the New York Times. “The awakening is slow, but it is underway.” Comey added, “Torches and death in Charlottesville. Children in cages at the border. The lying, misogyny, racism and attacks on the rule of law from our president. These things poke the giant. It takes time, but the American people are stirring. They always do. And when they awaken, these fevers break very quickly." Comey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, published his anti-Trump book "A Higher Loyalty” earlier this year, slamming Trump as "untethered to truth" and "ego-driven." Trump returned fire by saying it “was my great honor to fire James Comey,” calling him a “weak and untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible director of the FBI." On Tuesday, Comey tweeted a photo of himself , saying, “Voted. Now going out to knock on doors to urge everyone to vote. Should be fun.” The regional field director at the Democratic Party of Virginia posted a photo of Comey preparing to canvass for Democrats. A spokesman for Democratic congressional candidate Jennifer Wexton, who is running to unseat Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, said Comey told him “it's his first time canvassing.” That spokesman, Aaron Fritschner, said Comey thanked other volunteers for what they are "doing today." Still, some Democrats made it clear they're still irked by Comey’s handling of the Clinton email probe during the 2016 campaign. “Someone is seeking atonement...” tweeted Ian Sams, a spokesman for Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and a former Hillary Clinton aide. JAMES COMEY URGES VOTERS TO CHOOSE DEMOCRATS, WARNS THAT 'HISTORY HAS ITS EYES ON US' Comey has a history of donating to Republicans in past elections – but has called on people to vote Democrat in recent months. Donor records show that he donated to two Democratic congressional candidates this year, including Wexton and Abigail Spanberger, who is challenging Republican Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia. “This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders’ design that ‘Ambition must … counteract ambition,’” Comey tweeted in July. “All who believe in this country’s values must vote for Democrats this fall. History has its eyes on us.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.
---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/indiana-senate-donnelly-braun-tossup---split---Mike Braun won a three-way primary in May by casting himself as a businessman outsider in the model of Trump (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Republican Mike Braun has defeated Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana, a blow to Democrats trying to maintain their hold on red states that backed President Donald Trump. With 58 percent of precincts reporting, Braun led Donnelly percent to 54 percent to 42 percent when The Associated Press called the race. Libertarian nominee Lucy Brenton trailed with 4 percent. The Senate contest in the Hoosier State expected to be close, and it’s the only race that remained a Toss-up heading into Election Day, according to ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Trump made Indiana one of his final campaign stops, with a rally in Fort Wayne on the eve of the election. In a state he carried by 19 points and where he remains popular, both candidates had to play up their willingness to work with the president. Donnelly, a moderate Democrat elected to the Senate in 2012, even ran ads saying he supported building Trump’s border wall. He voted against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh but tried to distance himself from the “radical left.” Braun won a three-way primary in May by casting himself as a businessman outsider in the model of Trump. He barely mentioned that he was a former state representative, while casting two rival congressmen as career politicians. Instead, he talked about his distribution business, with most of his general election ads showing him walking around a warehouse. Democrats tried to turn that same business background into a vulnerability on the campaign trail, with both sides trying to make this contest about outsourcing. Democrats pummeled Braun for his business record — while included importing auto parts from China — and for workplace violations. Republicans, meanwhile, attacked Donnelly for once owning a stake in his brother’s company, which used Mexican labor. [5 Things That Defined the Fight for the Senate] Donnelly had the upper-hand for much of the contest following the primary. Braun spent more than $6 million of his own money to win the nomination, but he ran a lackluster campaign over the summer. Republicans worried that he wasn’t putting more of his own funds into the race and that he wasn’t active enough on the trail, especially not in deeply conservative areas of the state where he needed to run up the score. But Braun began to pick up momentum in the fall, partly because Republicans were tuning in late, partly because he kicked more money into his campaign, and partly because of Kavanaugh. Donnelly was one of three Democrats to vote for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch last year, but his break with Trump on Kavanaugh may have turned off some GOP and independent voters who’d been willing to stick with him over Braun. Donnelly has been called “the accidental senator” for winning the 2012 race against state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, whose gaffe about rape two weeks before the election turned off suburban GOP voters. But Donnelly supporters had hoped his “Hoosier common sense” campaign, which gave moderate Republicans in the so-called doughnut counties permission to vote for a Democrat in 2012, would help propel the senator over the finish line this year.

Donald Trump’s international image remains poor, and ratings for the U.S. have declined since his election. Yet most people around the world still want the U.S., not China, as the world’s leading power. Average citizens around the world see a technological revolution coming in the workplace, and they are concerned. Many fear robots and computers will eliminate jobs and increase inequality. Overall, 38% of Americans have a favorable opinion of China, down slightly from 44% in 2017. Concerns about China include economic threats, cyberattacks, environmental damage and human rights. Regardless of populist sentiments, people in Western Europe tend to favor parties that reflect their own ideological orientation. With regard to policy, too, ideology continues to matter.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/georgia-will-tell-us-america-tonight---split---As goes Georgia, so goes the country. Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is essentially the face of the resistance, Murphy writes. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images file photo) OPINION — Of all of the races to watch Tuesday night, the Georgia governor’s race may be the most important, both for the history it could make (Democrat Stacey Abrams could become the first black female governor in American history) and for what the results in the quickly changing state could tell us about trends in the rest of the country. It’s not exactly Peoria, but Georgia is increasingly representative of the racial, gender, political and business dynamics driving the country itself. First and foremost, the results in Georgia will be a fast and clear grade of the Trump presidency — period. The Republican nominee, Secretary of State Brian Kemp, has fashioned himself as Donald Trump in a plaid shirt from the beginning of the cycle. Kemp’s first ad introducing himself to Georgia voters featured a gun, a chainsaw, an explosion and Kemp’s pickup — “just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take ’em home myself. Yep. I just said that!” President Trump took the unusual step of endorsing Kemp before the GOP primary and has, along with Vice President Mike Pence, traveled to Georgia to campaign for him multiple times. On Sunday, Trump flew Air Force One to a middle Georgia airfield and called him “a great leader.” By contrast, Stacey Abrams is essentially the face of the resistance. She has promised to work with any president to advance the state, but her candidacy hinges on young voters, African-American voters, women and new immigrants — basically every group that Trump has attacked and demonized throughout his presidency. While issues like health care, the economy, education and immigration are animating the candidates, nothing casts as long a shadow over the race as the president himself. Speaking of issues, a win by Kemp will tell Georgia’s traditionally Chamber of Commerce Republican Party to leave their suits and ties at home for the next election. If a rifle-wielding, monster-truck-driving candidate wins any governor’s mansion Tuesday, expect more gun show Republicans, and fewer horse show Republicans, trying to run for the rest of Trump’s term. Also Watch: ‘The Character of This Country Is on the Ballot,’ Obama Says A win by Abrams, on the other hand, would change the winning playbook for Democrats across the South and across the country. Unlike nearly every Democrat before her in Georgia, Abrams has run an unapologetically progressive campaign after many, many, many half-in, half-out Democrats have tried mightily to appeal to Georgia’s large Republican population, only to lose anyway. Instead of tacking to the middle, Abrams has pushed Medicaid expansion, public education, voting rights and criminal justice reform. She’s opened the door to confiscating guns as a part of an assault weapons ban and welcomed Oprah and Barack Obama to campaign for her just four years after chronically timid Democrats like Jason Carter failed to appear with then-President Obama during a pre-election trip to Atlanta. And if Abrams loses, Democrats will have officially tried everything to win and failed. It’s hard to see what else they can do at that point other than wait for the demographics of the state and the country to change and pray that new voters will turn toward them eventually. Election night in Georgia will also tell us about the power, or lack thereof, of several voting groups in statewide elections — none more so than suburban women. Long a lock among Republicans, now it’s the GOP that’s making those women feel less safe, not more safe, when they send their kids off to school every day. Lucy McBath, the Democrat running in Georgia’s 6th District against GOP Rep. Karen Handel, has run aggressively on gun safety after Democrats have soft-pedaled that issue for years. McBath calls herself a “mother on a mission” and can only win the district, which went for Rep. Tom Price by more than 20 points in 2016, with the help of white suburban women. This is an ideal test-case to see if that’s possible for a Democrat in the Trump era. Finally, no matter what happens, expect a hard look in the state and around the country next year at whether a sitting secretary of state should oversee his or her own election to higher office in the future. Kemp’s insistence that he can do his day job while also running for governor has had an undeniably toxic effect on the integrity of the vote in Georgia. A WSB-TV poll released over the weekend showed a huge — and very partisan — divide over the integrity of the vote in Georgia. After months of national headlines about possible voter suppression from a number of Kemp-approved measures, 44 percent of voters in the state (mostly Democrats) say they it’s “likely” or “very likely” that many votes will not be counted on Election Day. At the same time, about half (mostly Republicans) said it’s “likely” or “very likely” that votes will be illegally cast by people who are not eligible to vote. That kind of doubt about the safety and security of the vote is dangerous and unacceptable. It’s also seen throughout the state as preventable, had the person in charge of voter integrity not also been seen as inherently biased about the outcome of the vote itself. That could change after this election. Georgians on both sides have told me that they see this race as a choice between the past and the future. Democrats say they want to move past the time in Georgia that they remember for segregation, voter suppression and racial oppression. But Republicans here see Georgia’s past as imperfect, of course, but also as simpler, easier and just plain better than the future they’re worried about with the arrival of new faces, new ideas and new politics. The results of the governor’s race will tell us everything about what that future is going to look like — in the state of Georgia and around the country. Stay tuned.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/a-divided-congress-still-has-time-for-redemption---split---Neil Gorsuch's confirmation stands out as a big achievement for the GOP Congress. (CQ Roll Call File Photo) The demise of the Republican effort to repeal the 2010 health care law put an exclamation point on what has become obvious in Washington: The GOP, for all its enthusiasm following its election win last year, is too riven with dissension to meet ambitious goals it set out for itself. And President Donald Trump seems to have oversold his skills as a deal-maker. “On delivering on their campaign promises, it’s hard to pat them on the back and tell them they’ve done a good job,” said Sam Geduldig, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, now a partner at the CGCN Group lobbying firm. That said, the downfall of the Senate health care effort has obscured the achievements Congress has had. History shows that “it is a mistake to expect big-ticket legislative accomplishments during the early months of presidents newly elected to the office,” said David Mayhew, the Yale political scientist who is perhaps America’s foremost student of congressional productivity. The exceptions come in moments of crisis, such as early 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed landmark legislation to regulate the sale of stock in response to the Great Depression, or early 2009, when President Barack Obama got his stimulus bill to revive an ailing economy. Obama didn’t sign his health care law or his financial regulatory overhaul, Dodd-Frank, until his second year in office. President George W. Bush got a tax cut across the finish line in June of his first year but didn’t sign the biggest policy victory of his first Congress, the No Child Left Behind law, until January of the following year. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have set ambitious goals to overhaul the 2010 health care law and revamp the tax code. Prospects for both look bleak — GOP leaders announced last week they were throwing out their initial tax plan — but who knows? It’s easy to foresee the 115th Congress setting a record for futility. But there have been achievements. So far, the biggest GOP win was the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, gained by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority to confirm him — as well as hold the seat open more than year after Antonin Scalia’s death, depriving Obama of the chance at so much as a hearing for his nominee to succeed Scalia, Merrick G. Garland. The Senate has confirmed every Trump Cabinet appointee it considered. Trump’s only loss on that front, his first Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder, dropped out after acknowledging that he’d hired an unauthorized immigrant as a housekeeper. Trump trails his three most recent predecessors, Obama, Bush and Bill Clinton, in the pace of his nominations and confirmations. On the productive side of the ledger, this Congress did make innovative use of the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law allowing it to rescind recently finalized regulations. It had been used successfully once before, in 2001, when Bush signed a resolution revoking a rule by the Clinton Labor Department requiring employers to protect their workers from repetitive stress injuries: the ergonomics rule. This year, Congress rescinded 14 Obama-era regulations to keep pollution out of streams and guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, among other things. Such CRA resolutions make up nearly a third of its legislative output. It also sets a precedent future Congresses will surely mimic. In May, Congress finalized fiscal 2017 spending. It came seven months after the fiscal year began, but was done without shutdown brinkmanship. In June, Trump signed a law that marks a bipartisan win: a measure responding to the scandal at Veterans Affairs Department hospitals, where dying veterans were left waiting for appointments. The law makes it easier to fire VA employees for poor performance and for whistleblowers to come forward. Still, Congress hasn’t made much progress on basic obligations. Fiscal 2018 appropriations bills have only begun to move, with no indication Republican leaders can, as promised, restore an orderly budget process. The House passed a “minibus” spending bill Thursday covering four of the 12 annual appropriations bills for defense, military construction and veterans’ benefits, energy, and the legislative branch. It included $1.57 billion for barriers along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. There’s little likelihood it will be enacted in its current form. Because Democrats can block appropriations bills in the Senate, given the 60-vote threshold there, the two parties need to reach a deal to raise limits on defense and nondefense spending enacted in 2011. Democrats don’t plan to go along with the wall funding, or the defense spending increase in the House bill if there are not comparable nondefense increases. Congress must raise the debt limit, too, this fall — always a fraught vote. House Republicans hope to move a fiscal 2018 budget resolution when they return in September that would allow them to move forward with a tax overhaul using the fast-track budget reconciliation procedure. Reconciliation allows the Senate to pass measures that have budgetary effects such as taxes, spending and the deficit with only a simple majority. But disagreements among Republicans over the centerpiece of the House GOP leaders’ initial tax proposal, a border adjustment tax that would have hit imports, prompted leadership on Thursday to ask the tax-writing committees to start over. Meanwhile, Congress is making progress on other must-pass bills. The House has passed measures reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration’s system of user fees — which help fund the agency — and a defense authorization bill. They await Senate action. Both chambers are moving forward with legislation, due by Sept. 30, to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. Progress is slow because of Trump’s plan to privatize the air traffic control system. The House has incorporated the proposal into its bill, but the Senate has rejected it. Republicans are divided over the idea, with rural members most likely to oppose it for fear it could hurt small airports. And work has begun on reauthorization of the federal flood insurance program, also set to expire this year. Another issue is what to do about surveillance authority granted to the National Security Agency in 2008 to collect emails of foreign terrorist suspects. The NSA’s dragnet at one time captured messages written by Americans who were not suspects but merely mentioned people who were, prompting an outcry from civil libertarians. The agency earlier this year said it was now only collecting emails to or from suspects. Even so, the expiration of the authority at the end of this year will prompt a fight between security hawks who want to renew it, and civil liberties advocates who want to let it expire, or curtail it. Congress has made no progress on a resolution. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Drew DeSilver Many of the millions of Americans voting in Tuesday’s midterm elections will have to do so while working around the demands of their jobs – hitting their polling places before work, taking an extra-long lunch break or going afterward and hoping to make it before the polls close. As they stand in line, many of them may wonder why it is that the United States votes on a Tuesday, of all days. (To be fair, more than 38 million Americans already have voted early in person, by mail or by absentee ballot, according to a tally maintained by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald.) The first law designating Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November was passed back in 1845. At the time, every state except South Carolina was choosing its presidential electors by popular vote, and had considerable flexibility in deciding when to hold its elections. But as transportation and communications links between the states improved, concern grew that later-voting states could be influenced by the results in earlier-voting ones. (As the Congressional Globe wrote, paraphrasing one congressman’s remarks, “The object of this bill was to guard against frauds in the elections of President and Vice President, by declaring that they shall all be held on the same day.”) But why November, and why on a Tuesday? As a State Department explainer from 2008 put it, back then the U.S. was a predominantly agrarian society. November made sense because it was after farmers were done with their harvest, but before hard winter weather that could make it difficult for them to get to town to vote. And since traveling by horse over unimproved roads could take a while, lawmakers wanted to avoid making their constituents travel to or from the polls on a Sunday (widely considered a day of rest and worship, not politicking). In the 21st century, however, America’s election schedule makes it an outlier among advanced industrial democracies. A Pew Research Center analysis finds that 27 of the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development hold their national elections on the weekend, while two others (Israel and South Korea) hold elections on weekdays but make those days national holidays so economic hardship won’t be a barrier to electoral participation. There have been repeated proposals in the U.S. over the years to either move Election Day to the weekend or make it a federal holiday, on the grounds that doing so would boost turnout. A recent Pew Research Center poll found bipartisan majority support for the idea: 71% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 59% of Republicans and GOP leaners said they would support making Election Day a national holiday. But while proposals to do that have periodically been introduced in Congress, none have gotten very far. Election Day is, however, a paid holiday in 13 states, at least for state employees (though Kentucky state workers only get the day off in presidential-election years); in New Mexico, state workers are allowed two hours of paid administrative leave to vote. Many states require employers to give their workers time off to vote; in some states, such as New York and California, workers can’t be docked any pay for taking time off to vote. And many employers, from outdoor clothing company Patagonia to restaurant chain Cava, have taken it upon themselves to give their workers paid time off to vote this year. Topics: Voter Participation, Elections and Campaigns, 2018 Election By Besheer Mohamed Many more U.S. Muslims identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party than the GOP (66% vs. 13%), but the share who are Republican has held steady over the last 10 years, including after the election of President Donald Trump, according to a new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data collected between 2007 and 2017. In 2007, 11% of Muslims identified as Republican. The share changed very little in surveys conducted by the Center in 2011 (11%) and 2017 (13%). Sizable shares of both Republican and Democratic Muslims are critical of the way both parties treat U.S. Muslims. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans (57%) and about half of Democrats (47%) say neither party is friendly toward Muslims in America. This criticism may be one reason a relatively large share of Muslims neither identify with nor lean toward either party. Indeed, U.S. Muslims are twice as likely as the public overall to say they lean toward neither major political party (20% vs. 9%). Read More → Topics: Muslims and Islam, Religious Affiliation, Muslim Americans, U.S. Political Parties, Religion and U.S. Politics By Monica Anderson and Jingjing Jiang Many Americans have been politically active on social media, from encouraging others to take action to using issue-related hashtags. And liberal Democrats were more likely than other ideological and partisan groups to have engaged in these activities, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of survey data collected this summer. Liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media to mobilize others or find like-minded groups. Some 44% of liberal Democrats say they have used these sites in the past year to encourage others to take action on an issue that was important to them, while a similar share (43%) have taken part in a group that shares their interest in a cause, according to a survey of U.S. adults conducted May 29-June 11, 2018. These shares fall to around a third or fewer among conservative or moderate Democrats and among conservative, moderate or liberal Republicans. Read More → Topics: Social Media, Voter Participation, Internet Activities, 2018 Election, Political Issue Priorities By Hannah Hartig Voters are more enthusiastic about voting than in any midterm election in over 20 years of Pew Research Center polling. Still, millions of Americans will not exercise their right to vote on Tuesday. When people are asked about their overall impressions of voting, there is a broad consensus that voting is “important.” But smaller majorities say it is “convenient,” “straightforward” or “exciting,” according to a new Pew Research Center survey on elections in America. Young adults, in particular, are less likely than older people to say voting is convenient and exciting: 50% of adults younger than 30 say voting is convenient, while 49% say it is exciting. That compares with majorities in older age groups. Read More → Topics: Voter Participation, 2018 Election By Jacob Poushter and Moira Fagan Americans have more confidence in the leaders of France, Japan and Germany to do the right thing regarding world affairs than they have in U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted earlier this year. Majorities in the U.S. view French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel with confidence, while about half (48%) are confident that Trump will do the right thing internationally. Still, Americans are more likely than others around the world to have confidence in Trump: Across 25 other surveyed nations, a median of just 27% have confidence in the U.S. president. Of the seven leaders tested in the survey, Americans have the lowest levels of confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin, with about one-in-five (21%) saying he will do the right thing in world affairs. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi receive equivalent ratings: About four-in-ten (39%) in the U.S. have confidence in each. Read More → Topics: Non-U.S. Political Leaders, Foreign Affairs and Policy, Donald Trump By Ana Gonzalez-Barrera and Jens Manuel Krogstad More Hispanic registered voters say they have given “quite a lot” of thought to the upcoming midterm elections compared with four years ago and are more enthusiastic to vote this year than in previous congressional elections. But they lag behind the general public on some measures of voter engagement, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys. Overall, 52% of Latino registered voters say they have given the coming November election “quite a lot” of thought, a 16-percentage-point increase from what they said about the last midterm election in 2014. In addition, a majority (55%) of Latino registered voters in 2018 say they are more enthusiastic about voting compared with previous congressional elections, up from 37% in 2014. However, Hispanic voters are less likely than all U.S. voters to say they know about the congressional candidates in their district (47% vs. 59%, respectively). Also, one-third of Hispanic voters (33%) say “voting by people like me doesn’t really affect how government runs things,” while 25% of all U.S. voters say this. (Among those eligible to vote but not registered, 53% of Hispanics and 47% of the general public say the same.) More than 29 million Hispanics are eligible to vote, a new high, up 4 million from 2014. (Eligible voters are U.S. citizens ages 18 years and older.) However, Hispanic voter turnout has long trailed that of other groups. In 2014, an estimated 27% of Hispanic eligible voters cast a ballot, a record low and far below the turnout rate among black voters (41%) and white voters (46%). This year’s election comes at a time when most Latinos have grown dissatisfied with the nation’s direction and have more concerns about their place in American society. They also overwhelmingly disapprove of the president’s performance and see his administration’s policies as harmful to Latinos. Even so, not all Latinos feel the same way. Latino Republicans are generally more upbeat than Latino Democrats on these measures. Similar shares of both groups say they have given quite a lot of thought to the upcoming election and say they are more enthusiastic to vote than in previous congressional elections. Read More → Topics: Hispanic/Latino Vote, Voter Demographics, Voter Participation, 2018 Election By Elizabeth Grieco Newsroom employees are more likely to be white and male than U.S. workers overall. There are signs, though, of a turning tide: Younger newsroom employees show greater racial, ethnic and gender diversity than their older colleagues, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. More than three-quarters (77%) of newsroom employees – those who work as reporters, editors, photographers and videographers in the newspaper, broadcasting and internet publishing industries – are non-Hispanic whites, according to the analysis of 2012-2016 American Community Survey data. That is true of 65% of U.S. workers in all occupations and industries combined. Newsroom employees are also more likely than workers overall to be male. About six-in-ten newsroom employees (61%) are men, compared with 53% of all workers. When combining race/ethnicity and gender, almost half (48%) of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white men compared with about a third (34%) of workers overall. Read More → Topics: Newsroom Investment and Resources, Work and Employment, Race and Ethnicity, News Media Sectors By Jeffrey S. Passel, D’Vera Cohn and John Gramlich About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, the latest year for which information is available, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. This represents a 36% decrease from a peak of about 390,000 in 2007. The analysis follows President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration may seek to end “birthright citizenship.” Births to unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. generally rose throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s but have declined since the start of the Great Recession about a decade ago, according to estimates based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and its Current Population Survey. The number of babies born to unauthorized immigrant parents represented about 6% of the 4.0 million total births in the U.S. in 2016, compared with 9% of all births in 2007. Birthright citizenship derives from the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1868, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. The provision has long been interpreted to apply to U.S.-born children regardless of the immigration status of their parents. While the Center’s new analysis provides estimates about the number and share of U.S.-born babies with unauthorized immigrant parents, it’s important to note that the legal status of immigrant parents can change over time. For example, parents who have legal permission to be in the U.S. at the time of their child’s birth might later overstay their visas or otherwise become unauthorized. Similarly, parents who are unauthorized immigrants at the time of their child’s birth might later become lawful immigrants and then naturalized citizens. (This analysis also slightly revises earlier estimates published by Pew Research Center.) Read More → Topics: Unauthorized Immigration, Immigration Trends, Population Trends, Immigration By Abigail Geiger With this year’s midterm elections just a week away, here are some key findings from Pew Research Center surveys over the past several months about some of the dynamics and issues shaping the battle for Congress. Large shares of voters – in both parties – say which party controls Congress is a factor in their vote this year. About three-quarters of registered voters who support Democratic candidates (77%) and those who support Republican candidates (73%) say which party controls Congress will factor into their vote. And large majorities of those backing Democrats (77%) and those supporting Republicans (82%) expect their party to hold a House majority after the elections. But Republicans are more bullish than Democrats about Senate control: 87% of Republican voters expect the GOP to hold a Senate majority; 62% of Democratic voters expect their party to have the majority. Health care and the economy are among the top voting issues. About three-quarters of registered voters cite health care (75%) and the economy (74%) as very important issues to their vote this year, but there are partisan divisions. Nearly nine-in-ten Democratic candidate supporters (88%) say health care is very important, compared with six-in-ten Republican supporters. On the economy, 85% of Republican voters cite this as a very important issue for their vote, compared with 66% of Democratic voters. In the survey, conducted amid the Senate’s confirmation proceedings for Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, large shares of Democratic (81%) and Republican voters (72%) also said Supreme Court appointments would be a very important voting issue. Read More → Topics: Congress, Political Party Affiliation, Voter Participation, Donald Trump, Voter Preferences, 2018 Election, Political Issue Priorities By Drew DeSilver On Nov. 6, millions of Americans will hunker down in front of their TVs, boot up their computers or curl up with their mobile devices for a long evening of election-watching. Besides the results of hundreds of House, Senate and gubernatorial contests, these people will get plenty of analysis and commentary about what the voting patterns tell us about the state of the nation. For more than a quarter-century, no matter which channel you were watching, much of that punditry ultimately derived from the same source: a nationwide survey of voters as they left their local polling places. That exit poll will occur this year too, sponsored by four major news networks and conducted by Edison Research. (In recent years, the polling-place interviews have been supplemented with pre-election phone interviews in states where a sizable share of the vote is cast via early, absentee or mail voting.) But on election night 2018, there will be an additional source of data on who voted and why, developed by The Associated Press, Fox News and NORC at the University of Chicago and based on a very different methodology. That means that depending on where you go for election news, you may get a somewhat different portrait of this year’s electorate. Those competing election-night efforts won’t be the last word on explaining the midterms. The Current Population Survey (conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics) will look at Americans’ self-reported registration and voting activity, and post-election surveys from various research groups will delve more deeply into what voters’ thoughts and motives were as they made their choices. Though such reports tend to get more attention from political scientists and other researchers than the news media (perhaps because they come out months or even years after the election), they may provide a fuller, more accurate account of the who, how, what and why of the 2018 midterms.

(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images) For most of its history, Congress has been an important check on presidential power. President Franklin Roosevelt’s fellow Democrats, for instance, killed his plan to expand the Supreme Court to pack it with his own yes men. And a band of Republicans made clear to President Richard Nixon that he would be impeached for his Watergate transgressions if he did not resign. The current GOP-controlled House and Senate, however, have been little but obedient lap dogs to President Donald Trump. This would be troubling under any circumstances. But it is especially so now with a president who careens from gross incompetence to troubling executive overreach; who tolerates, even encourages, corrupt behavior; and who tries to govern through a toxic mix of self-adulation, divisive rhetoric, fearmongering, outright lies and juvenile name-calling. It is not healthy for the country, or the institution, when Congress abets Trump’s politicized attacks on his own Justice Department and on the free press. Nor is it healthy when Trump’s fellow Republicans remain mostly silent when he incites hate groups with incendiary language, or when he veers erratically from threatening nuclear war with North Korea to declaring himself “in love” with dictator Kim Jong Un. Now comes the first general election of the Trump era, which carries with it a crucial opportunity to restore the basic oversight functions of Congress. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: To deliver even more results, vote Republican The institution needs men and women of good faith who will stand against presidential overreach. It needs lawmakers who will unite, not divide; who do not regard compromise as a dirty word; and who will stand up for what is a co-equal branch of government with the presidency. The stakes in this year’s elections, which Trump himself describes as a referendum on his presidency, could not be higher. Yet typically, only about 40 percent of the eligible population participates in midterm elections, compared with an estimated 60 percent during presidential years. That number dropped to just 36.7 percent in in 2014, setting a record low for midterms going back to World War II. Those who don’t vote shouldn’t complain about the outcome. Tuesday’s results will determine the degree to which Trump’s baser instincts will be reined in and the degree to which the rule of law will once again be an important principle in our nation’s capital. In the weeks and months ahead, special counsel Robert Mueller is likely to provide more clarity on a number of issues, among them Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, Trump’s longstanding business ties with Russia, and whether his firing of James Comey, the FBI director who was overseeing the Russia inquiry, constituted obstruction of justice. The next Congress — indeed, this one — needs to make clear that it will not tolerate efforts to end or limit Mueller’s inquiry, either through some kind of chain-reaction firing at the Justice Department or by Trump’s ongoing drumbeat of public criticisms. The current House and Senate have failed miserably at their duty to conduct oversight hearings and to put guardrails around a reckless president whose own aides have questioned his fitness. It is time to elect a Congress that will do better. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

And that has allowed some to conceal their identities and motives. A link has been sent to your friend's email address. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs “Donde votar?” Google says that’s the top trending search the morning of election day in the U.S. Buzz60 Voters wait in-line for entering a polling station to cast their votes on Election Day, Nov. 6, 2018, in Franklin, Tenn. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO – Who was trying to influence your vote in the midterm elections? On Facebook, it was not always easy to find out. Political advertisers are required to fill in a field that says who paid for the message in your news feed, but that does not necessarily tell you who they or their backers are. Entities can write whatever they want in that field as long as it's not deceptive or misleading. A growing number of Facebook ads in the run-up to the election took advantage of that loophole to obscure or conceal the identity and political motives of who paid for them – and Facebook did not catch it. That allowed some Facebook pages to remain anonymous while stirring political discord. Take a Facebook page called Defending Donald, which spent $14,535 on 94 political ads, reaching hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. Some were pro-Trump ads such as this one that was displayed to Facebook users as many as 200,000 times: "The House and Senate have done a horrific job backing up the president on protecting pre-existing conditions." But the Facebook page itself sometimes sent mixed political signals. Read one post: "Trump: Laughingstock of UN." The disclaimer on the ads said they were paid for by the Facebook page, with no indication of who was behind the Facebook page or who was behind an affiliated website by the same name. Some Facebook users who felt tricked by ads into visiting the Facebook page vented their frustration in the comments. "This site, Defending Donald, is a scam people," wrote one. "It's a liberal site." The administrator of the Facebook page, which has 17,000 followers and was created in June, did not respond to a request for comment. Alerted by USA TODAY, Facebook said it has requested "appropriate verification," such as a Federal Election Commission number or employer identification number, from the purchaser of the Defending Donald political ads. "We've disapproved these 'paid for by' disclaimers and their ads until the person paying for them provides the appropriate verification," Facebook said in a statement. Facebook doesn’t try to verify who's behind every political ad, but political advertisers must accurately represent themselves, and most of them do, the company says. When Facebook identifies potentially deceptive or misleading disclaimers, it investigates and may remove them. Facebook says it's exploring "additional checks" to prevent abuse. After ads on the social network were used to spread disinformation and divisive Russian propaganda during and after the 2016 presidential election, Facebook tightened its policies around political ad buying. Any people or groups who want to buy political ads on Facebook are required to verify their identities and prove they have a mailing address in the U.S. The ads, whether they are targeted at political campaigns or discuss issues of national importance, are kept in a searchable database for seven years, offering a rare glimpse into how political campaigns target Facebook users. Families for Trump, with 11,000 followers, also created in June, is another Facebook page buying up political messaging to lure Facebook users, spending $10,516 on 57 ads. But the Facebook page doesn't always offer up the pro-Trump posts that those Facebook users expect. One post on Families for Trump claimed Republican tax cuts had failed to help families. Another post commented: "This seems to be a growing sentiment among many swing voters regarding healthcare" on an article written by a swing voter who leaned Republican but changed her mind over the treatment of preexisting conditions. "What exactly is this?" one bewildered Facebook user asked in the comments. Families for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook pages hawking ads that target Democrats or Republicans then bombard them with messaging from the other side of the aisle proliferated in the weeks before the midterm elections, according to Damon McCoy, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. "Groups create these disingenuous, grassroots-looking communities on Facebook, and you can't trace these damn things," he said. "There are so many of them, we can't even catalog them all. They are popping up left and right." A Facebook Elections sign. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP) The Daily Beast uncovered newly incorporated limited liability companies secretively backing a network of Facebook pages to carry out attacks on Republican policies, donors and candidates. The Atlantic tracked the network to a media industry veteran Dan Fletcher, who runs a company, MotiveAI. An anti-Ted Cruz page called Crush Cruz, which did not offer any information on who was behind the push to reach Texas voters, was uncovered by CNN Business. Twice the news outlet caught the page violating Facebook's rules. Facebook missed both violations. The New York Times exposed anonymous attack ads in a competitive race in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. Lack of regulation of political ads on digital platforms leaves it up to individual social media companies to decide how much or little political ad buyers are required to disclose. Facebook does not disclose the identity of political ad buyers. Under Federal Election Commission rules, political committees must disclose digital ad spending in public filings, but there are no set rules for disclosures on digital platforms such as Facebook.

Ads that reference or feature political candidates or current officials may require additional information to run on Facebook. Facebook says it also may request the Federal Election Commission or tax identification numbers if an ad is reported or identified as inaccurate or misleading. An election war room in the company's Menlo Park, California, headquarters monitors these kinds of issues to identify patterns so Facebook can crack down on offenders. Facebook says it is also working with election authorities to flag potentially problematic ads. But, it says, there is no comprehensive source where it can verify registered political groups at the national, state and local level. And, Facebook points out, its disclosure policy applies to ads about political issues, not just candidates, unlike Google which only tracks ads about federal candidates or officeholders. Issue ads on television also don’t require a disclaimer. Like Facebook, Twitter requires a disclaimer for ads about political candidates and issues. But Twitter verifies advertisers through their Employer Identification Numbers. McCoy, one of the researchers behind NYU's Online Political Ads Transparency Project, says Facebook's political ad system – and the archive that compiles political ads for seven years – has increased transparency and accountability. "It's an improvement. Before, we didn't see this mess," he said. "At least Facebook is making this mess transparent to us." Faith in Facebook's new political advertising system has been rocked in the weeks leading up to the midterms. Vice got approval to buy fake Facebook ads on behalf of Vice President Mike Pence, the Islamic State and 100 U.S. senators. Business Insider bought fake Facebook ads that it wrote were paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct political consulting firm that was banned by Facebook for exploiting the personal information of millions of Facebook users without their consent. ProPublica identified ad campaigns from industry lobbying groups that obscured who was behind them. The growing laundry list of problems has lawmakers calling on Facebook to tighten its protocols. "If Facebook is going to claim to verify who’s paying for political ads, they need to actually do the work," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. Facebook has also been criticized by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who co-sponsored the Honest Ads Act along with Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. That legislation, which is being backed by Facebook and Twitter, would increase disclosure requirements for online political ads.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, Fox News projects, dealing a major setback to President Trump’s legislative agenda and giving fresh hope to liberals who want to investigate and perhaps even impeach the president. Although the exact size of the Democratic majority is not yet clear, Democrats will soon have to decide whether to restore Nancy Pelosi to her old job as speaker of the House, which she held from 2007 to 2011. Meanwhile, the race for Senate remains tight and several key races are too close to call. But Fox News has made a number of calls so far. In Indiana, Republican businessman Mike Braun will defeat first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in one of the most closely fought races in the country, Fox News projects, in a major pickup for Republicans as they look to expand their narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate. Trump had aggressively campaigned for Braun in recent days, and Donnelly's vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation was one of the key factors in the race. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will win re-election by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin, Fox News also projects. In another key race, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker. While Blackburn spent all summer trailing Bredesen in the polls, she closed the gap and took the lead about a month ago, despite a last-minute endorsement by pop star Taylor Swift for Bredesen. Menendez, meanwhile, never trailed Hugin despite being seen as potentially vulnerable due to his 2017 federal corruption trial. The Fox News Decision Desk also projects that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will win re-election by defeating Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Kavanaugh. And the Fox News Decision Desk can now project that none of the four candidates in Mississippi's special Senate election will win tonight because none garnered 50 percent of the vote. The top two finishers – Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy -- will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27. A number of other key races remain too close to call. In Texas, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a very slight lead over Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke. The Fox News Decision Desk also cannot yet project a winner in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally is in a tight battle with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Democrats were able to regain the majority in the House by flipping key seats; they needed to take 23 for a majority. In Northern Virginia's 10th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is projected to lose to her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Comstock was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. And 77-year-old Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, has defeated Republican opponent Maria Elvira Salazar in Florida's 27th Congressional District, which has long been held by the GOP. But two major Democratic efforts to flip Republican-controlled seats have come up short. In Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath. The two had been competing in a neck-and-neck race, which Democrats saw as an opportunity to flip a seat in a GOP-leaning district. McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission, campaigned on a largely anti-Trump platform. And Republican Denver Riggleman has defeated Democrat Leslie Cockburn to keep a closely watched Virginia congressional seat in the hands of the GOP. Virginia's 5th Congressional District is home to incumbent GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, who announced that he would not seek re-election earlier this year amid mounting scandals. While the district supported President Trump in 2016 by double-digits, the contest had been tight between Cockburn, a former journalist who favors Medicare-for-all, and Riggleman, a staunch Republican. Still, although voters in more than half of the 50 states have now locked in their ballots, the results of some of the most closely watched and consequential Senate and House contests in the midterms are still undetermined as Democrats look for signs of the blue wave they have predicted in recent days. In North Dakota, Fox News is waiting for more data before projecting a winner in the race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer. As of poll closing, Cramer is in the lead. The Missouri contest between Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley, the state’s attorney general, is among those too close to project a winner, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. McCaskill said on Monday she doesn't "really care" if Democrats retake the Senate, in an apparent effort to appeal to moderate voters in a state Trump carried by double digits in 2016.

And Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, will easily win a third term by defeating Republican Lawrence Zupan. And Democratic Sen.Elizabeth Warren will win a second term in Massachusetts, although she is already considering a presidential run in 2020. Warren defeated Republican Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker. In another expected result, the Fox News Decision Desk can project that incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown will win a third term by defeating Republican Rep. Jim Renacci. FULL MIDTERM RESULTS / MIDTERM LIVE BLOG "Everything we have achieved is at stake," Trump, who announced that he will watch the election returns at the White House with family and friends, declared on Monday. Trump has openly characterized the first nationwide election since his rise to the presidency as a referendum on his tenure, which has seen significant economic growth and a rise in partisanship. WATCH: COMSTOCK SAYS THREAT TO IMPEACH KAVANAUGH IS 'RIDICULOUS' Democrat and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger also is challenging Tea Party-affiliated Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who has represented the state's 7th Congressional District since 2014, when he stunned the nation by unseating then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor. Trump also carried this district by 7 points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for almost 50 years. But changing demographics have put it in play, analysts say. On the gubernatorial side, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum could make history as Florida's first black governor if he defeats Republican Ron DeSantis to replace Scott, who is term-limited. Gillum supports Medicare-for-all and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, and he has the backing of liberal megadonors like billionaire Tom Steyer in his bid to shift the state dramatically to the left. His agenda contrasts sharply with DeSantis, a hard-line Republican who cut an advertisement in which he teaches his child to "build the wall" with toy blocks. The race is currently too close to call. And in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams could also make history as the country's first black female governor. She is facing off against Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose hard-line voter registration policies have drawn rebukes from civil-rights groups and a federal judge, and Libertarian Party nominee Ted Metz. Kemp announced that his office was investigating "possible cyber crimes" by the Georgia Democratic Party on Sunday, throwing a last-minute wildcard into the race. It is too early to call that race. Depending on Tuesday's vote totals, Georgia may not have a governor-elect for several more weeks. Under Georgia law, if no single gubernatorial candidate gains at least 50 percent of the vote, a Dec. 4 runoff will be scheduled.

---split---9.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meet-conor-lamb-democrat-nab-seat-trump-country/story?id=53685989---split---Conor Lamb, a 33-year-old Democrat Marine Corps captain has mounted a surprisingly competitive bid deep in Trump country as he seeks to win a House seat in the Pennsylvania 18th Congressional District's special election. If Lamb wins, he could become one of the most conservative Democrats in office. It is also a race that has nabbed national attention and is seen as a bellwether for the 2018 midterms, President Donald Trump's political influence and the Democratic party's ability to deliver a message that their candidates can be competitive anywhere in the country. In a district Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016 some polls show the race within 5 points. What he stands for The former assistant U.S. attorney has vocally expressed his personal views on abortion and gun control and supported President Trump’s recent steel and aluminum tariff legislation. He says he is a proud Catholic who opposes abortion but doesn’t believe his personal views should impact legislation. Lamb supports affordable health care and as a federal prosecutor worked closely with families whose loved ones were victims of the opioid crisis.   Lamb has also said he would work with the current administration to get the job done and that he won't support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to lead Democrats in that chamber if he is elected. On the campaign trail Lamb fundraising prowess has helped him maintain a competitive edge. He has raised nearly $3.3 million during the first two months of the year. By contrast, Lamb’s opponent, Rick Saccone has raised $917,892 during the same time period. Outside groups have invested $1.7 million so far into Lamb’s campaign - Saccone has raised nearly $10.3 million in super PACs and outside groups. A poll conducted by Monmouth University show the race as incredibly close.   Democrats are rooting for Lamb's bid to win the congressional seat and he has garnered support from political figures like former Vice President Joe Biden, who campaigned alongside Lamb at Robert Morris University in Moon, Pennsylvania last week. “The impact would be profound. I promise if you if he wins you’re going to see probably another half a dozen Republicans say they’re not running again,” Biden told the crowd of supporters. Still, he faces tough math to claim a win. An ABC analysis found that Lamb would need to outdo former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in votes in both red and blue areas from the 2016 primary. His opponent Rick Saccone, the 60-year-old four-term Pennsylvania state representative comes with decades of experience — a point he makes regularly. He served in the United States Air Force as a special agent and is a former diplomatic representative in North Korea during President George W. Bush's adminsitration. President Trump, who recently agreed to meet with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, rallied outside of Pittsburgh Saturday for Saccone.   Trump also had a few choice words about Lamb. “And Conor lamb, lamb the sham, lamb the sham, he's trying to act like a Republican so he gets — he won't give me one vote. I don't know him. Looks like a nice guy. I hear he's nice looking,” Trump said. Trump accused Lamb of trying to “act like a Republican.” The president even touted how if he met Lamb, Saccone might be angry. "I might like him. And then Rick is going to be very angry at me,” Trump said.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/5-reasons-democrats-poised-take-house---split---Harley Rouda, a Democrat running for California's 48th Congressional District, speaks during his campaign rally in Laguna Beach, Calif. in May (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) At the start of this election cycle, historical trends suggested Democrats were likely to make gains in the House. Two years later, they appear to be on the verge of taking over the chamber. A few surprising developments helped them get there. While President Donald Trump has attempted to deflect blame should Republicans lose House control Tuesday, he has certainly been a factor in this year’s contests. That’s typical for midterm elections — the president’s party has lost an average of 33 seats in 18 of the last 20 midterms. It’s difficult to distill the fight for the House to a handful of developments, with individual candidates and differing dynamics playing out in dozens of races across the country. But there have been a few overlapping themes that help explain what has given House Democrats the edge this election season. Watch: How We Got Here — The Biggest Surprises in a Campaign Season for the Ages Early on it was clear this election was going to be expensive. Democratic candidates were quick to raise eye-popping figures fueled by small-dollar donations, but that could have been written off as what some fundraisers refer to as “love money,” or funds from family members and friends that dry up after the first quarter. But Democratic donors kept giving, leading to a “green wave” that overwhelmed dozens of GOP incumbents, some of whom haven’t faced a competitive race in years. According to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, more than 110 Democratic challengers outraised their Republican opponents in the third fundraising quarter that ended Sept. 30. Corry Bliss, the executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, wrote in a memo to donors last week that “the overall financial situation [for Republicans] remains alarming.” Fifty-nine GOP-held seats made the DCCC’s initial target list, but that grew to 101 by February of this year. Not all of those races are competitive, but the battlefield kept expanding throughout the cycle. The 25 Republicans in districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 were natural targets, but Democrats also focused on districts that supported former President Barack Obama and flipped to Trump, as well as other traditionally Republican seats in the suburbs. A slew of Republican retirements also opened up competitive seats for Democrats, further expanding the map. Republicans have a few open-seat targets in Minnesota and Nevada, where incumbents opted to run for higher office. Democratic chances of picking up seats in Pennsylvania improved when the state Supreme Court imposed a new congressional map, making several districts more Democratic. Democrats also breathed a sigh of relief after the California primaries when they avoided a November shutout. (Under the Golden State’s top-two primary system, crowded fields could have split the Democratic vote, allowing two Republicans to advance to the general election.) But the national party did have to spend millions to make sure a Democrat made it out of those primaries. Democrats also say their recruits in Republican-leaning districts, such as Utah’s 4th or New York’s 22nd, helped put tough races in play. In Utah, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams faces GOP Rep. Mia Love in a district Trump won by 7 points in 2016. And in New York, state Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi is taking on GOP Rep. Claudia Tenney in a district that backed the president by 16 points. Activity in Congress had a big influence on the campaign trail this cycle, beginning with last year’s failed GOP effort to repeal much of the 2010 health care law. Health care has dominated Democratic messaging, with candidates across the country highlighting the potential impact of the repeal effort. Republicans also worried that the failed attempt could deflate turnout among GOP voters, who for years had been promised that a Republican-controlled government would repeal the health care law. Republicans viewed passage of their tax overhaul as a major achievement that could help them retain House control. They’ve credited the tax law for the strengthening economy and expect it to pay dividends at the ballot box. But GOP leaders have had to remind their incumbents to tout the accomplishment on the campaign trail, and privately they wish Trump would have done so more often. At the same time, Democrats have been casting the overhaul as a tax break for the wealthiest Americans. Republicans believe the recent Supreme Court confirmation battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh could benefit their House candidates. One GOP strategist noted that the episode — in which Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school — woke Republicans up, and could explain why some races, like GOP Rep. Rod Blum’s in Iowa’s 1st District, tightened in recent weeks. But the high court fight also energized Democrats. And it threatens to tarnish Republicans in suburban districts, where GOP and independent women are already turned off by Trump. A key question this cycle was whether some GOP voters supported Clinton in 2016 as a one-time rejection of Trump, or whether that anti-Trump sentiment would extend to congressional Republicans. The president remains unpopular in suburban districts so his campaign activity has been focused mostly on red states and districts. Trump’s election also energized an unprecedented number of female Democratic House candidates as well as women who joined grassroots groups. Republican and independent women who disapprove of Trump are expected to be critical swing voters in GOP-held suburban districts. Republicans had some unwelcome developments, with two incumbents facing indictments ahead of Election Day. California Rep. Duncan Hunter was charged with misusing campaign funds, while New York Rep. Chris Collins was charged with insider trading. Both congressmen insist they’re innocent, but the controversies have made their deeply Republican districts more competitive than they might otherwise have been. Another unexpectedly competitive district is Iowa’s 4th District, where GOP Rep. Steve King is facing renewed criticism for past racist remarks and statements supporting far-right personalities. Some Republicans have faced ethics troubles, including Blum in Iowa who is under a House Ethics investigation for not disclosing his ownership of a company. Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte has faced some Democratic attacks after pleading guilty to assaulting a reporter ahead of last year’s special election. Democrats have also been attacking Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor for his staff’s involvement in forging petition signatures to get a third-party candidate (and potential Democratic spoiler) on to the ballot. Simone Pathé contributed to this report.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/11/celebrity-endorsements-donald-trump-hillary-clinton---split---The election was two weeks ago, but as demonstrated by the fire stoked after Kanye West voiced his support for Donald Trump at a concert on Thursday, celebrities’ political leanings in 2016 are still very much a point of fascination. We’ve now (sort of) collected ourselves enough to start asking, “What happened?” in the time since Trump’s shocking win over Hillary Clinton. While political experts will be trying to answer this exact question for years to come, there’s one specific area that may fall lower on the priority list: the role of celebrity endorsements—when they’re pitted against a bulldozing reality TV personality with inherent star power. Clinton certainly collected an overwhelming amount of them in the run up to November 8. And, not only did stars use their immense platforms to back the Democratic nominee, but they also participated in more candidate-agnostic public-service campaigns urging Americans to vote at all. It’s impossible to directly measure how many votes an Instagram video of Beyoncé telling people “I’m with her” yielded on Election Day, even if it racked up 2.2 million views. There aren’t any exit polls asking if people decided to cast their ballots because of a cheeky, celebrity-filled Rock the Vote video. Without pure, quantifiable data, those that leverage Americans with the largest platforms—entertainers, media personalities, and athletes—must now look for cracks in the machine to find out what went wrong; where they missed opportunities; or if, what Clinton supporters like Lena Dunham said in her P.S.A. (“I’m wondering if I’m hurting her chances of winning.”) proved to be portent rather than parody. Hollywood does tend to swing to the left, but Clinton, whose campaign actively targeted young people, may have focused on getting and publicizing celebrity endorsements for two reasons. First, stars and “influencers” are already all over social media delivering messages to this cohort. Second, organizations focused primarily on the youth vote see the 18 to 24 demographic as the most sympathetic to their influence. It’s also the least likely to vote, so inspiring messages from their favorite famous figures could, hypothetically, urge them to the polls. Nevertheless, the 2016 election is bearing out to show similar low engagement to results reported in a 2014 study from the U.S. Census Bureau. It found that voting rates among 18- to 24-year-olds in all elections dropped from 50.9 percent in 1964 to 38 percent in 2012. The first election that Rock the Vote, a nonpartisan organization focused on youth-voting advocacy, influenced 1992, and 2008 (when Barack Obama ran for the first time) marked banner years for the age group, but the rate has never returned to 1964 levels. (Vanity Fair reached out to a Clinton representative for comment on this article, but had not heard back prior to publication.) So, what happened? Clinton may have been hoping to reproduce Oprah’s momentous impact on Obama’s campaign to secure the Democratic nomination in 2008. Winfrey, talk-show host turned moral center for much of America, formally endorsed Obama in 2007, three months after he announced his candidacy. One study estimated that Winfrey influenced one million voters in favor of Obama in the 2008 democratic primary. A unique set of circumstances rendered Winfrey’s endorsement both effective and measurably so. She was a credible source of influence, she had not overtly stepped outside her lane as an entertainer before, and she was differentiating between two politicians with similar policies in the same party during its primary. She wasn’t telling Republicans to vote Democrat or vice versa. “It’s asymmetrical warfare but it doesn’t mean that it’s asymmetrically helpful.” Michael Cobb, associate professor of political science at N.C. State, said that this sort of nuance is where celebrity influence can reside. “There’s very little evidence that anyone, let alone celebrities, can convince people in a hyper-partisan age to vote for somebody of the other party,” Cobb said. “That’s just not what they’re being asked to do and that’s not what they can do.” Oprah was one of the many celebrities to declare “I’m with her” in 2016, but the endorsement didn’t propel Clinton to the presidency. Additionally, after the election when Oprah tweeted that “#HopeLives” after Trump met with Obama in the White House, she was accused of trying to normalize Trump. Clinton and Obama are obviously different candidates, but 2016 seems miles away from 2008. Now, the ever-vigilant Twitterverse is always watching, itching to call out a celebrity on every potential misstep—even Oprah. Cynicism appears to have reached an all-time high when it comes to stars commenting on politics. Formal celebrity endorsements are not new. Warren G. Harding is often credited with securing the first celebrity endorsements during the 1920 election thanks to support from the Chicago Cubs and film stars like Mary Pickford. John F. Kennedy had the “Rat Pack.” Ronald Reagan had Frank Sinatra. In the 90s, Rock the Vote worked with MTV on a concerted, deliberate effort to wrangle stars that would speak directly to the youth vote. Madonna wore an American flag and encouraged MTV’s audience to vote by rapping to the tune of “Vogue” about censorship (the original cause of musicians and the youth, by extension). Twenty-five years later, it seems everyone but Taylor Swift is expected to offer their preferred candidate. The problem is that when everyone from Broadway stars to pop stars to Pretty Little Liars stars do speak out, the noise is deafening—and alienating to voters who don’t want to hear what “Hollywood elites,” whose self-interests differ from their own, think. “In this media environment, I don’t think there’s any one news source or any one influencer or one celebrity that can sway a whole broad swath of people’s points of view,” Ronnie Cho, head of public affairs at MTV and former associate director of public engagement for the White House under Obama said. “A healthy skepticism young people have for people telling them what to do and telling them how to think that makes it harder for even the most followed person on Twitter, like Katy Perry, to turn out people to vote.” The gulf between celebrity endorsements on the Democratic versus Republican side is stark during every election, but this year, the rift seemed infinite. Hillary Clinton had Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, and even Lebron James. #ImWithHer hashtags decorated social output from Ariana Grande, Jennifer Lopez, the Kardashians, and Rihanna, as well as YouTube stars like Tyler Oakley. Clinton carried far and away the majority of celebrity seals of approval. VIDEO: Which Candidate Had the Best Celebrity Endorsements? One of the most obvious positive effects of these voices on Democratic campaigns especially is in fund-raising efforts. High-profile gets make collecting money a more efficient proposition. “[Politicians] say, ‘Hey, if you give $20, you get entered into a raffle to have dinner with me, Jay Z, and Beyoncé, or Sarah Jessica Parker, in New York.’ So you’re more likely to give just twenty bucks than you would be if the candidate just said, ‘Hey, give me twenty bucks,’” Cobb said. Democratic constituents, who have become increasingly savvy as to which region a certain celebrity will make the most impact, know “very well what celebrities are popular more in which areas, and they explicitly coordinate,” according to Cobb. This smart placement perhaps reached its zenith under Clinton, but did it ultimately hurt her? President-elect Trump, after all, had very few conspicuous celebrity endorsements, besides Scott Baio. “It’s asymmetrical warfare but it doesn’t mean that it’s asymmetrically helpful,” Cobb said. “And that goes back to, again, just because you can get people to come out to your crowd because you’ve got a more popular celebrity doesn’t mean they’re doing anything about voter choice.” Rock the Vote president Carolyn DeWitt, on the other hand, thinks this flooding technique could prove successful. “Often the more times you reach a person, the more likely they are to take action,” she wrote in an e-mail. The organization relies on Vevo and publishers like MTV to create and distribute compelling storytelling and visuals “that reach voters on an emotional level.” DeWitt chooses to look on the bright side, counting the inroads RtV made, rather than the votes that never showed. The youth vote “made the difference in key states, races, and ballot measures. Millennials were decisive in both the Nevada and New Hampshire Senate races, and the presidential race in both states as well. Elsewhere, like Michigan, millennials kept the presidential race much closer than it would have been.” To complete the picture, she rightly notes that you’d have to consider direct and indirect voter suppression. “This was the first presidential election without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act,” she notes. “We saw the effect that that had across the country.” Many of the celebrity P.S.A.s this year leaned into the idea that no one wants to hear about politics from a Grammy/Oscar/Emmy winner. Lena Dunham’s parody of the earnest P.S.A., “Sensual Pantsuit Anthem,” tried to promote Hillary Clinton and voting through an attempted self-aware rap. Its views were under 500,000. Rachel Bloom’s “We Are the World”-style short, “Holy Shit (You’ve Got to Vote)”, succeeded in self-awareness were Dunham might have failed. The song (performed by celebrities with varying degrees of fame) covered the importance of voting at the same time that it disavowed a celebrity’s right to give any sort of political advice. Bloom’s intention wasn’t to change any minds. She told Entertainment Weekly, “No Trump voter is getting swayed at this point from a comedy video” (hers was released on November 4, just days before the election). Instead, she said, “If this video motivates one person, especially in a swing state, to just get out there, then it will have been worth it.” Her video has received about 3.6 million views, but despite earning Funny or Die’s “immortal” rating, its 170 or so comments are riddled with negative detritus. They echo the tone of the “Save the Day Response,” a video made by a Republican ad firm called BrabenderCox, which answered Avengers director Joss Whedon’s “Save the Day” voter P.S.A., featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, among others. The stars never name names, but when Don Cheadle refers to “a racist, abusive coward who could permanently damage the fabric of our society,” viewers can extrapolate. BrabenderCox’s video leaned on the same idea as Bloom’s—that celebrities should stay in their lane—but with added snark. The Hollywood Reporter points out that far-right Republican heavyweights from Sean Hannity to Glenn Beck tweeted the video, and it garnered about 14 million views before the election. In the same story, THR delved into the behind-the-scenes work that rallied a constituency that’s highly suspicious of the overwhelmingly liberal Hollywood. Which brings us to the limits of celebrity endorsements and P.S.A. efforts when they run up against the unfortunate runaway success of a celebrity candidate. “Ted Nugent shows up at a Trump thing, and he’ll grab his crotch and yell about something, but that’s not why people are there. They’re there for Trump,” Cobb said, noting it’s something that research on the subject will have to consider moving forward. “I’ve always thought that credibility is the main specific—that is, you have to have some evidence you know what you’re talking about,” he said. “Trump challenges that . . . [O]bjectively that there’s very little evidence he knows much about what he’s about to do, and at least an equal amount of people made peace with that.” In other words, all of the behavioral research in the world couldn’t stop a single star from glowing orange and cutting through the celebrity noise. He removes middleman when it comes to endorsements. Instead of the transitive property of Katy Perry (“I’m a Katy Perry fan; Katy Perry is a Hillary Clinton fan; I’m a Hillary Clinton fan), there’s the much simpler “I’m a Trump fan” equation, for better or worse.

(Nov. 6) AP Fox News host Sean Hannity (right) speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a campaign rally Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. (Photo: Jeff Roberson/Associated Press) Monday morning Sean Hannity, Fox News’ most-popular personality, tweeted that, despite what you may have heard, he was not going to campaign with President Donald Trump. "In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past." Fast-forward to Monday night. And there, standing onstage with Trump in Cape Girardeau, was Hannity, campaigning with the president. Trump called him up during the rally (the interview took place beforehand), and of course, Hannity obeyed. This isn't really surprising; if you've watched five minutes of Hannity’s Fox News show, you know that he is slavishly devoted to Trump. What is somewhat surprising, and despicable, is what Hannity said when he got to the stage. "By the way," he said, pointing to the back of the hall where reporters were gathered, "all those people in the back are fake news." "Fake," as in saying you're going to do one thing and then doing the opposite? Got it. Except when it suits him to pretend to be one, Hannity often claims he’s not a journalist. He proved it then. How do you think the Fox News reporters covering the rally felt? Jeanine Pirro, host of "Justice with Judge Jeanine" on Fox News, also appeared onstage, exhorting the crowd to vote Republican.

Tuesday, Fox News issued the following statement: Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed. Hannity, for his part, also issued a statement: "What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president’s request. This was NOT planned. To be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at Fox News in those remarks. They do amazing work day in and day out in a fair and balanced way and it is an honor to work with such great professionals." What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful.

Hannity complained that the only problem was that Trump missed his opening monologue. "No, I saw it on the plane," Trump said. "Actually, I saw it on the plane. I never miss your opening monologue. I would never do that." With the unconditional love Hannity offers every night on his show — and Monday night in person — why would he?

---split---11.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-grants-trump-family-18-trademarks-months-58992677---split---The Chinese government granted 18 trademarks to companies linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump over the last two months, Chinese public records show, raising concerns about conflicts of interest in the White House on the eve of national elections. In October, China's Trademark Office granted provisional approval for 16 trademarks to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, bringing to 34 the total number of marks China has greenlighted this year, according to the office's online database. The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines. The approvals came three months after Ivanka Trump announced she was dissolving her namesake brand to focus on government work. China also granted provisional approval for two "Trump" trademarks to DTTM Operations LLC, headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. They cover branded restaurant, bar and hotel services, as well as clothing and shoes. The marks will be finalized if there is no objection during a 90-day comment period. All the trademarks were applied for in 2016. Both the president and his daughter have substantial intellectual property holdings in China. Critics worry that China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party, could exploit those valuable rights for political leverage. There has also been concern that the Trump family's global intellectual property portfolio lays the groundwork for the president and his daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office. "Ivanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses," wrote Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group that first published the news about Ivanka Trump brand's new Chinese trademarks. Lawyers for Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump in Beijing declined immediate comment. Companies register trademarks for a variety of reasons. They can be a sign of corporate ambition, but many companies also file defensively, particularly in China, where trademark squatting is rampant. Trademarks are classified by category and may include items that a brand does not intend to market. Some trademark lawyers also advise clients to register trademarks for merchandise made in China, even if it's not sold there. China has said it handles all trademark applications equally under the law. ——— Associated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.

---split---12.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/five-things-defined-fight-senate---split---Former state Rep. Mike Braun defeated two congressmen in the Indiana Senate Republican primary. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation threw a wildcard into the race for Senate control. But the contours of the fight for the chamber aren’t much different from a year ago: Democrats running for re-election in states President Donald Trump carried by wide margins in 2016 are in trouble heading into Election Day. Democrats are defending 26 seats — 10 of them in states that backed Trump — while Republicans are only defending nine. Given that imbalance, it’s no surprise that Trump’s effect on Senate races has been different from his influence on the fight for control of the House, where he’s put GOP incumbents on defense. Here are five defining elements — including a few surprises — that have shaped where we are on Election Day.Watch: How We Got Here — The Biggest Surprises in a Campaign Season for the Ages Democratic odds of retaking the Senate would have been more daunting without Roy Moore. The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice was on course to win last December’s special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Alabama Senate seat until The Washington Post broke the story about him making inappropriate sexual advances toward teenagers when he was in his 30s. The White House and the Republican National Committee’s decision to stand by Moore tarnished the GOP in some voters’ minds. But more significantly for the battle for the Senate, Democrat Doug Jones won. And his victory cut the number of seats Democrats need to flip from three to two. As demonstrated by the Alabama Senate result, former White House adviser Steve Bannon hasn’t lived up to his own hype. He’d promised to give every Senate Republican, except Texas’ Ted Cruz, a primary race. But primaries against Senate GOP incumbents were a nonissue this year. (House Democrats got a taste of that anti-incumbent tension instead.) That doesn’t mean Republicans were without internecine warfare or anti-establishment fervor, though. West Virginia, Indiana and Arizona saw three of the nastiest Senate primaries, with three Republicans in each state duking it out in Trump loyalty contests. Arizona Rep. Martha McSally defeated two Trump loyalists in her primary: controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former state Sen. Kelli Ward. She received a boost from establishment Republicans, but some in the party believe that money might have been better spent attacking the Democratic nominee, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who got a head start on the airwaves while Republicans fought it out until late August. West Virginia Republicans also battled over who was most loyal to Trump (and who was a closet Hillary Clinton supporter). Democrats attacked GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins, whom they thought would give incumbent Joe Manchin III his toughest challenge. After dodging Don Blankenship, Republicans ended up with state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who ran as an anti-Washington outsider in the primary but hasn’t been able to land those punches as successfully against Manchin, who’s slid down the list of most vulnerable senators. In Indiana, GOP nominee Mike Braun dispatched two rival congressmen in the primary by touting himself as a businessman outsider just like Trump. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates his general election race against Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly a Toss-up. Trump’s 2016 margin in the Hoosier State, combined with Donnelly’s vote against Kavanaugh, could tip the scales for Braun. But if the Republican loses Tuesday, it’ll be another reminder of how difficult it is for a GOP candidate who is not Trump to replicate his success. Several other Republican nominees have already discovered that. Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta and Ohio Rep. James B. Renacci both embraced the president early on in their Senate races, but neither stands much chance of winning in states that backed Trump in 2016. The fact that Ohio and Pennsylvania (both home to expensive 2016 Senate races), Wisconsin, and Michigan never developed into top-tier races significantly altered the battlefield by almost cutting in half the number of seats Democrats needed to defend. That freed up national resources for expensive states like Florida, where despite spending millions of dollars of his own money, GOP Gov. Rick Scott has not been able to put his race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson away. It also meant national Democrats had money to throw at New Jersey, where a Republican self-funder has made the race more competitive than it should be in a blue state. National Republicans, meanwhile, have been forced to spend in two unexpected states. Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen has given GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn a real race in Tennessee, while Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s fundraising has put Cruz on defense. As they have all year, Democrats at both the House and Senate levels have been almost singularly focused on health care. After failing to pass their plan to repeal the 2010 health care law, Republicans turned to the tax overhaul as a legislative achievement they could tout on the campaign trail. But Senate Democrats got more health care ammunition when Republican attorneys general (two of whom also happen to be running for Senate) signed on to a Texas lawsuit against the 2010 law. At the very least, it gave Manchin another object to shoot at, which makes for good television in West Virginia. The allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers and the subsequent hearings energized both the left and the right, the net effect of which is still to be determined. Many of the most competitive Senate races have tightened this fall. And it’s difficult to determine causality — some of that could be Republicans naturally tuning in late — but the hearings certainly contributed to a greater nationalization of these races. Nationalized races benefit Republicans at the Senate level. (The opposite is true at the House level.) Republican strategists credit the White House for getting Trump out on the trail repeatedly in places like Montana, for example, where the GOP nominee would likely lose a localized race to Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. “This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense,” Trump said last month at a Montana rally for Tester’s opponent, state Auditor Matt Rosendale. Republicans running for Senate hope he’s right. But that may come at the expense of their colleagues in the House. Bridget Bowman contributed to this report.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-russia-sancations-bill---split---President Donald Trump plans to sign a bill slapping sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Despite posturing otherwise this week, President Trump will sign a bill that passed overwhelmingly in both chambers slapping new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, the White House announced Friday night. “President Donald J. Trump read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it,” according to a statement issued by the office of Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. “He has now reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it.” The announcement ended several days of drama during which some of the president’s closest aides suggested he might veto the legislation. It also came mere hours after he fired White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and replaced him with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general. Trump’s decision to slap stiffer penalties on Moscow also comes amid a scandal over whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Vladimir Putin’s government. Trump has seemed reluctant to enact such sanctions, but appears to have bowed to domestic political pressures, mostly from his own party. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said multiple times this week that the Trump administration was “nonexistent” as lawmakers sought a final deal on the sanctions bill. On Thursday, incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said Trump might veto a House-passed measure that would slap new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea so he can “negotiate” tougher penalties against Moscow, says In an unscheduled and combative phone call to CNN’s “New Day” morning show, Scaramucci said, after a separate 15-minute talk with Trump, the president had not ruled out rejecting a bill that got 419 Republican and Democratic votes in the House and 98 bipartisan votes in the Senate. Scaramucci on Thursday morning said Trump, at that time, was considering vetoing the sanctions so he could be tougher on the Russians than the Congress via his own sanctions. “He may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians,” the flamboyant former Wall Street financier said. But after the Senate vote, Trump faced an overwhelming veto-proof majority in both chambers, composed largely of members of his own party. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chuckled Thursday when asked if he thought Trump would veto the measure. He told Roll Call that during multiple recent conversations with Trump, the president gave him no indication a veto was afoot.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs AP Debrief: Trump looms over midterm election AP People line up to vote on the last day of early voting at the Minneapolis Early Vote Center Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) ORG XMIT: MP103 (Photo: Jim Mone, AP) Political elections and financial tumult have been intertwined ever since 2016, when the unexpected Brexit vote and President Trump's win caught investors off guard, sending shock waves through markets. In Tuesday's midterm elections, however, most Wall Street analysts aren't expecting market upheaval. The reason: Even if the vote results in a power shift in Congress and a return to divided government, it's unlikely to bring any near-term policy changes that will undo Trump's economic agenda or the passage of laws that will spook investors. Wall Street is already gearing up for the possibility that the Democrats will take back the House while the Republicans keep power in the Senate. This base case, investors say, would result in legislative gridlock, but not upset the status quo. In short, a split Congress would put the brakes on legislative activity in the coming year. "People look at a divided Congress as not necessarily a bad thing," says JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, a discount brokerage based in Omaha, Nebraska. Still, the market reaction could be more violent under two scenarios: if the Democrats can engineer an election sweep and grab power back in both chambers of Congress, or the Trump-led GOP retains control of both the House and Senate. "Surprise outcomes can obviously move markets, but they are not anticipated outcomes," says Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investments in Zurich, Switzerland. Wall Street will gain a degree of certainty regardless of the vote outcome, and that clarity has historically been bullish for stocks. Not only has the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index been higher one year after every midterm election since 1946, the fourth quarter of the midterm election year and the first two quarters of the following year have historically been the most bullish nine months in the four-year presidential cycle, according to data from LPL Financial. A split Congress won't mean the undoing of the president's big moves so far, such as a massive tax cut passed in late 2017, analysts say. Nor will it affect Trump's rollback of business regulations, as those were decided by executive action rather than new laws passed by Congress. There's also a chance, although there's no guarantee, that both parties will team up to get an infrastructure bill passed. A split Congress, however, will doom Trump's hopes for additional tax cuts. History says a scenario of Trump in the White House and a split Congress will be a bullish combination. Stocks have performed best with a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled Congress (posting average gains of 18.3 percent from 1950 through 2017), followed closely by a 15.7 percent gain with a Republican president and a split Congress, LPL Financial data show. More Money: Trade wars, taxes, immigration among top economic issues for voters in midterm elections More Money: 401(k) millionaires at Fidelity jump 41 percent in third quarter to record 187,400 More Money: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season The most negative outcome for markets would be if the Democrats regain total control of Congress. Under that scenario, Trump's agenda would face an aggressive pushback, his plan for additional tax cuts would be blocked, and he would likely face Congressional investigations into things like Russian interference in the 2016 elections and his tax cuts that Democrats say favor big corporations and the rich. The specter of a move to impeach the president will also increase. "While (a Democratic sweep is) unlikely, the uncertainty would likely hit stock markets hard," Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said in an e-mail. In the event the Democrats take back Congress, pharmaceutical stocks could come under pressure if the party renews its push for lower prices for prescription drugs, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank. Shares of banks could also feel pain if the Democrats attempt to reverse the wave of deregulation of financial companies under Trump. Budget negotiations with Trump are also likely to intensify as Democrats look to push back on spiraling deficits due to unfunded tax cuts. On the plus side, investors may welcome a Democratic "pushback on protectionism," which could help de-escalate the president's trade fight with China. Still, a wholesale unraveling of Trump's tax cuts or other parts of his agenda of the past two years are unlikely, as it "would likely face the veto pen of the president," Michael Feroli, an economist at J.P. Morgan said in a report. If the GOP keeps their power in the Senate and House, for example, it would validate Trump's economic policies and likely give stocks a lift, although there's a possible downside if the president uses his broad mandate to push China even harder on trade, causing a full-blown trade war, warns Hatheway of GAM Investments. "Trump might feel emboldened to do things that would prove risky for investors," says Hatheway. "That would be unambiguously bad for the stock market."

Will they lose seats? USA TODAY President Donald Trump supports Rep. Marsha Blackburn at a rally in Chattanooga, Tenn. (Photo: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel) WASHINGTON – Democrats’ hopes of taking the Senate took a major hit Tuesday when Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly fell while the party also lost a pick-up opportunity in Tennessee. Beto O'Rourke's spirited challenge against Texas Republican Ted Cruz gave Democrats hope of picking up territory elsewhere in their uphill battle to win control of the Senate. And Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia survived in a state President Donald Trump won by 42 percentage points, according to the Associated Press. But the Senate battle in the swing state of Florida was neck-and-neck between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott. Meanwhile, Fox News and CNN projected that Republican Marsha Blackburn would defeat Democrat Phil Bredesen in a GOP-held seat Democrats had hoped to flip. The Associated Press declared GOP challenger Mike Braun the winner over Donnelly. Trump visited Indiana three times in the final two weeks to generate support for the Republican candidate. Donnelly was one of five Democratic incumbents struggling to survive in states Trump easily carried. Trump dubbed Donnelly "Sleepin' Joe" during a campaign rally days after Braun won a bitter GOP primary running as a businessman outsider in the mold of President Donald Trump. Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Joyce bragged Tuesday that the party has a new nickname for Donnelly that "we think will really stick this time: former Senator Donnelly." Although House Democrats headed into Tuesday with the wind at their backs, Senate Republicans had hopes of adding to their slim 51-49 majority. The reason? Democrats are defending 26 of the 35 seats on the ballot, including 10 in states won by Donald Trump. "It’s the worst map for one party I have ever seen," wrote veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberg.  Besides Donnelly and Manchin, the other Democrats running in top Trump states are Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. The last time they were on the ballot, the nation wasn't as divided along partisan lines and voters were more willing to split their tickets. "People are voting in a more parliamentary way," said Charlie Cook, head of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The incumbents focused on nonpartisan local issues – such as helping veterans – while heavily emphasizing health care, an issue with a lot of crossover appeal, particularly for female voters. They've promised to be with Trump when they agree with him and stand up to him when they don't. Red-state Democrats have had the difficult task of keeping their base enthused about their re-election bids while attracting enough of the Republicans they need to carry their states. After Manchin voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the liberal group MoveOn.org did not include West Virginia in its voter mobilization campaign. "We just felt like we couldn’t in good faith spend our members’ money on a race where the Democratic candidate was so far from where our members are on such an important issue," said MoveOn's Nick Berning. Trump focused his final campaign blitz on turning out the Republican vote in states with close Senate contests. "I think I've made a big difference," the president said outside the White House on Sunday before flying to more states. "I think I've made a difference of five or six or seven." His campaign stops did not include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania or Michigan – states Trump narrowly carried but where the Democratic incumbents have had easier re-election campaigns than expected. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, called them “snap-back” states. Trump’s small 2016 margin means there are many voters "who have a party ID not aligned with the president.” “Given the first opportunity, they reassert their old selves,” he said. Conversely, the long-standing partisan leanings of red Texas are challenged by O'Rourke's social media-fueled campaign against Cruz. In heavily blue New Jersey, Democrats had to pour millions of dollars into last-minute advertising to help Sen. Bob Menendez, who survived a trial on bribery and other corruption charges last fall, then was admonished by the bipartisan Senate ethics committee. Democrats hope to offset any losses with pickups in Tennessee and Arizona, states where the Republican incumbent chose not to seek re-election after being publicly critical of Trump. In Nevada, where Sen. Dean Heller is the only Republican senator facing re-election in a state Trump lost, Heller has both embraced Trump and tried to create some distance. Heller said 80 percent of what the president’s done has been “very, very good” while the rest has been a “reality TV show.” Conceding that Democrats' path to winning the Senate on Tuesday is a narrow one, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, head of the campaign arm of Senate Democrats, emphasized that his party is in a lot better shape than anyone would've predicted 18 months ago when Republicans thought they could win enough seats to have a filibuster-proof majority. "No one's talking about that right now," Van Hollen said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." Cook, the nonpartisan handicapper, said it's possible for Democrats to pick up a Senate seat or two. But the most likely outcome, he predicted on the Friday before the election, is that Republicans at least hold steady, if not gain one or two Senate seats, while losing the House. The Senate does not always move in the same direction as the House in an election. In 1970, for example, Republicans gave up 10 seats in the House while gaining one in the Senate. But a party has never lost complete control of the House while increasing power in the Senate, according to Eric Ostermeier, author of the Smart Politics blog run by the University of Minnesota. "This is unusual because the odds are so heavily stacked in favor of the party that is actually the less popular party," Sabato said. "The Democrats pretty much were behind the eight ball in the Senate from the beginning." A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Nov. 6) AP President Donald Trump shakes hands with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, right, during a campaign rally, Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP) WASHINGTON – Fox News said Tuesday that it did not approve of appearances by some of the networks' personalities at a Republican campaign event. Host Sean Hannity and his fellow conservative commentator from Fox News, Jeanine Pirro, were invited onstage by President Donald Trump during a campaign rally Monday in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Both delivered short remarks in support of Trump and the Republican platform. Rush Limbaugh, a conservative pundit who does not work for Fox, introduced Trump at the event. "Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed," the cable news network said in a statement on Tuesday. The network did not elaborate on how the matter had been addressed. On Sunday, ABC News tweeted a screen grab of a press release from the Trump campaign announcing "special guest appearances by conservative media legends Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity" at the president's final midterm campaign stop in Cape Girardeau. The statement has since been removed from the campaign's website. Ahead of the rally, Hannity sent a tweet explaining: "In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President." In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past. But at the event, Trump called Hannity to the stage, saying, "Sean Hannity, come on up," and embracing the commentator before leading him to the podium. "By the way, all those people in the back are fake news," Hannity began as he gestured toward the news media in the auditorium, to the delight of the president. He said he had no idea the president was going to call him to the stage. The Fox News host then said, "The one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: promises made, promises kept," parroting a Trump campaign slogan. In a tweet Tuesday, Hannity repeated his claim that the appearance was not scheduled ahead of time (despite the earlier announcement that he would appear at that exact rally), and he insisted that when Trump called him onstage, "I was surprised, yet honored by the president's request." What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president’s request. This was NOT planned. Trump also called Pirro to the stage, introducing the Fox News host as "a woman on Saturday night that treats us very, very well." She spoke briefly, touting the economy under Trump and encouraging people to vote. Since its founding, Fox News has sought to be a conservative voice in what its backers said was a predominantly liberal news media landscape. Critics have long accused the network of distorting facts in favor of its political bias. But those criticisms have mounted since Trump took office, with many of the networks' hosts appearing to act as cheerleaders for the president's agenda. In July, Bill Shine, a former top Fox News executive who left over the network's handling of sexual harassment complaints, joined the White House communications team. In May, New York magazine reported that Trump and Hannity confer nearly every weeknight. CNN quoted unnamed senior staffers at Fox News on Tuesday who said they were "aghast" at Hannity's appearance at the rally. "People throughout the company think a new line was crossed," one senior Fox News employee said, according to CNN.

---split---18.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/election-day.html---split---Supported by By The New York Times • Here’s what to watch as results come in. | Get live results here. Republican businessman Mike Braun, of Indiana, has won his Senate race, beating Senator Joe Donnelly, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Donnelly’s defeat deals a significant blow to Democratic efforts to retake control of the Senate. Democrats expect Senator Heidi Heidkamp to lose her reelection race in North Dakota. That means the party has to sweep all four remaining competitive senate races to win the majority, an extremely high bar. The Indiana race was a neck-and-neck contest until the final days, attracting top surrogates from both parties in the final days, including former President Barack Obama and two visits from Mr. Trump. Mr. Donnelly was one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, who supported Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall and refusing to rule out changing birthright citizenship. Mr. Braun, meanwhile, ran as a staunch backer of the president. Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, was elected to a third term on Tuesday, withstanding a public backlash over his federal corruption trial and the official Senate criticism he received for misusing his office for personal gain. That’s a relief for Democrats who worried that the unpopular senator could deal a surprise blow to their already challenging chances of taking control of the chamber. Read more about the race here. Polls have closed in 15 more states, including Arizona, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Minnesota has been ground zero for the Democratic efforts to retake the House, with half of the state’s seats in play. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, and Martha McSally, the Republican, are vying in a tight race for Senator Jeff Flake’s seat. And in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker is facing a tough re-election battle against Tony Evers, the Democrat. Representative Andy Barr, an incumbent Republican, defeated Amy McGrath, one of the Democratic Party’s most prominent challengers, according to The Associated Press. The contest took on national importance as a proxy for whether Democrats could win over white working class voters in rural areas and whether women would rise up against the barbed-wire rhetoric and harsh policies of the Trump presidency. Democrats picked up two House seats early in the evening, with victories for Donna Shalala, in Florida, and Jennifer Wexton, in Virginia. Ms. Shalala, a former Clinton administration cabinet official, beat Maria Elvira Salazar, a former broadcast journalist, for the Miami-area seat in a heavily Latino district. Ms. Wexton has been leading Representative Barbara Comstock for months, leaving many in the party to anticipate her loss even as Republican officials kept spending money to support her re-election bid. Her Northern Virginia district is home to a significant population of affluent, college-educated women, who’s been energized by their opposition to the president. How well Democrats do with that demographic will be crucial to their success in the suburban House races that make up many of the most competitive contests. Their victories mark bright spots for Democrats, who’ve watched as their hopes have been dashed with losses in districts they’d hoped would be competitive elsewhere in Florida. See more results from Virginia here. House Republicans have successfully defended a few conservative-leaning districts where Democrats saw at least some hope for upset victories, limiting Democrats’ potential gains in Florida’s historically Republican outer suburbs. Three Republican incumbents — Representatives Brian Mast, Vern Buchanan and Mario Diaz-Balart — held their seats in districts based near Palm Beach, Tampa and Miami, respectively. In a fourth race, Michael Waltz, a Republican, claimed a seat outside Jacksonville left vacant by former Representative Ron DeSantis, who resigned to run for governor. Democrats were not counting on any of the four districts in order to amass 218 seats for a House majority. But in recent weeks they had seriously contested the Mast and DeSantis seats, especially, and the ease with which Republicans held them may indicate a limit to Democratic inroads in areas with conservative political DNA. See more results from Florida here. At 8 p.m., polls closed in 20 more states, among them parts of Texas, Florida and Michigan. In Texas, Beto O’Rouke’s campaign mobilized Democrats across the country, as he’s closed the gap with Senator Ted Cruz. In Michigan, an all-female Democratic ticket, led by Gretchen Whitmer, the candidate for governor, is expected to make gains. And in Florida, Andrew Gillum would become the state’s first black governor if he beats former Representative Ron DeSantis, a Republican. Results will also start coming soon for tight Senate races in Tennessee and Missouri. Democratic senators in Massachusetts, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have won their re-election races, as widely expected. The winners include Senator Elizabeth Warren, who spent much of her re-election campaign all but openly running for president. This fall, Ms. Warren said she would “take a hard look” at running for the White House after the midterms are over. She’s argued that a female president could fix a “broken Washington.” At 7 p.m. polls closed in: Georgia, much of Florida, New Hampshire, the remainder of Indiana, Western Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. That means ballots will begin being counted in two of the most hotly contested governor’s races: Georgia and Florida. Democratic wins in both races would mark historic firsts for their states: Stacey Abrams would become the first black female governor in the country, and Andrew Gillum would become the first black governor in Florida. Democrats are also hoping to pick up some House seats in Virginia, once a red state that’s become far more purple in recent elections. Virginia’s Seventh has been one to watch, with former C.I.A. agent Abigail Spanberger running a neck-and-neck race against incumbent Representative Dave Brat. Brat, a Republican, is famous for his surprise defeat of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014. Strategists are also keeping a close eye on Representative Barbara Comstock’s Northern Virginia district. A large Democratic turnout in the affluent, highly educated area would show the power of the energized women whose opposition to Mr. Trump has powered much of the Democratic enthusiasm throughout the midterms. In Vermont, Christine Hallquist, the country’s first openly transgender nominee for a major party in a governor’s race, is trying to oust a popular Republican incumbent. TOPEKA, Kan. — After months of parades and debates and commercials and bus tours, it was time to wait. Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach, the Trump acolyte running for governor of Kansas, stood in a hotel ballroom in Topeka as Election Day faded into election night. The sprawling room was mostly empty, but patriotic table decorations, Kansas-shaped chocolate bars and stacks of dinner plates were already in place. In a few hours, the polls would close. His supporters would arrive. Mr. Kobach, who barely won the Republican primary for governor, had spent the last months locked in an exceptionally close race with the Democratic nominee, State Senator Laura Kelly. One poll would show a two-point lead for one candidate, another a one-point lead for the other. “It looks like it’s high turnout in more conservative counties and high turnout in more liberal counties,” Mr. Kobach told reporters Tuesday afternoon as Fox News played on a giant projection screen beside him. “I’m thinking that a lot of the pollster models may be off. Which direction they are off, who knows. We’ll find out tonight.” After Ms. Kelly cast her ballot earlier Tuesday, at a theater in another part of Topeka, she said she was putting the finishing touches on her election night speech. Multiple versions of it. — Mitch Smith Hey, I’m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I’ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.  Early exit polls reported by CNN on Tuesday night showed a gloomy mood in the country after months of contentious campaigning against a recent backdrop of racial tensions and spurts of violence. Fifty-six percent of voters said they thought the country was headed in the wrong direction, the cable network reported, with 56 percent disapproving of President Trump, 54 percent disapproving of the Republican Party and 55 percent disapproving of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. That pessimism belied the positive impression most voters hold about the economy halfway through Mr. Trump’s term. Sixty-eight percent of voters said they believed the economy was in good shape, according to the exit polls, and when it came to personal finances only 14 percent of voters said they were worse off than a year ago. Eighty four percent said their finances were either better off or in the same position. Mr. Trump has sought to frame the midterm elections as a referendum on his presidency and has campaigned on appeals to law and order and fears over illegal immigration. But exit polls reported by CNN suggested that most voters have been focused on something else: health care. Forty one percent of voters said that health care was the most important issue facing the country, while only 23 percent cited immigration. The economy was the number one issue for 21 percent of voters, and 11 percent said they were most concerned with gun policy. Overall, 39 percent of voters said they went to the polls to express their opposition to the president, while 26 percent said they wanted to show support for him. Thirty-three percent said Mr. Trump was not a factor in their vote. — Liam Stack What happens in the Midwest? Midwestern states helped make Mr. Trump president. Democrats think that all changes tonight, while Republicans are hoping for a couple of crucial, high-profile wins. In Senate and governor’s races, Democrats believe they are prepared to rebuild the “blue wall” that Mr. Trump breached in 2016, particularly in Michigan. The biggest prize of the night would be toppling Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whose conservative agenda has diminished the power of labor unions in that state. But Republicans are betting that Mr. Walker hangs on, and that the party could win the governor’s race in Ohio. Is history made or not? Much of the attention has centered on a few high-profile candidates, like Andrew Gillum, who would be the first African-American governor of Florida, and Stacey Abrams, who would be the first African-American female governor in any state. But other barriers are almost sure to fall, like the election of the first Muslim-American woman in Congress and the first openly gay man to be elected governor of any state (in this case, Colorado). What issues will have the greatest impact? If American voters had only followed the 2018 election through Democratic campaign ads, they may have thought that the campaign was entirely defined by health care. If they score major victories in the House tonight, their strategy of focusing more on health care than President Trump will be vindicated. For Republicans, the issue set is more divergent. Some of their candidates in more moderate areas have focused intently on trumpeting the health of the economy. But other Republican contenders in more conservative-leaning areas have echoed Mr. Trump’s hard-line rhetoric on issues related to race and immigration, hoping that sounding Trumpian notes will lure his voters out to the polls in larger numbers. What kind of night will President Trump have? What’s not in much doubt Tuesday night is whether Mr. Trump will accept any blame if Republicans suffer losses. Spoiler: he likely will not. The best possible outcome for the president would be if his party retains its House majority, no matter how narrowly, while adding to its one-seat Senate majority and minimizing losses in governorships. A bad night for Mr. Trump would be if Republicans lost the House, most of the most competitive governor’s races and did not net any Senate seats. A disastrous night for the president? Democrats take control of the Senate and the House.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. President Trump says there's 'no reason' to go on about the great economy during the border crisis while Paul Ryan reportedly disagrees. It’s finally here. After hundreds of campaign rallies, billions of dollars in donations, a nonstop blitz of TV advertising and polling that’s been in full swing since summer, Election Day has arrived – and with it, voters’ midterm verdict on whether Republicans should hold or lose their grip on power in Washington. Democrats have been working toward this day since the moment President Trump was sworn in. They’ve waited two long years for the shot to win enough seats in Congress to cripple the 45th president’s agenda. In the end, the elections will go one of three ways: Republicans hold both chambers, Democrats take the majority in both, or the parties split the House and Senate. Either of the latter two scenarios would be problematic for Trump, immediately putting a damper on his agenda. By the numbers, 35 Senate seats, 36 gubernatorial seats and 435 House seats are up for grabs on Tuesday. And the biggest names in both parties say the stakes couldn’t be higher. “America is at a crossroads right now,” former President Barack Obama told supporters in Illinois over the weekend, saying it “might be the most important election of my lifetime, maybe more important than 2008.” Trump himself has been campaigning non-stop in recent days, telling voters they must keep Democrats from taking back control of the House and Senate, or his agenda could be in jeopardy. The party of the president has historically lost seats in their first midterm elections. “We have to win,” Trump told supporters Monday during a telephone town hall, ticking off accomplishments during his first years in office and warning everything he’s accomplished as president can be “undone and changed by the Democrats.” Here’s the lay of the land on Election Day: Election watchers could be in for a long time. The first polls, on the East Coast, close at 7 p.m. ET. After polls on the West Coast close at 11 p.m. ET, the last will close in Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. Ahead of the vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi confidently predicted last week that Democrats would indeed win back the House. “Let me say this. Up until today, I would’ve said, ‘If the election were held today, we would win,’” Pelosi said on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Tuesday. “What now I’m saying is, ‘We will win.’” But there are no guarantees about Election Day, even as generic congressional ballots show Democrats with the advantage over Republicans. While Democrats need to net 23 seats for a majority, the Fox News House Power Rankings indicate there are 29 “toss-up” races. If Democrats are victorious, the Trump administration likely will be in for a challenging 2019. Should Democrats re-take the House, there are signs some in the conference may launch a push to impeach the president – though the leadership has not yet backed the effort. Pelosi has said impeachment is "not a priority," at least not until Special Counsel Robert Mueller announces the conclusions of his probe into the Trump administration's alleged dealings with Russia. Trump, though, almost assuredly will face an avalanche of investigations into his tax returns, his payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and his relationship with Russia if Democrats win back the House – which comes with the much-coveted power to subpoena and launch congressional investigations. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLOSING ARGUMENT: VOTE REPUBLICAN AND CONTINUE THE JOBS BOOM A number of prominent anti-Trump Democrats also would be poised to assume control of key committees if Republicans lose control of the House. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., likely would be elevated to chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, where she currently serves as ranking member. Another top California Democratic representative, Adam Schiff, would likely rise to chair the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member. And Pelosi would look to regain the speakership. Still, if Democrats win the House – but Republicans hold the Senate – their legislative priorities likely would stall. In the Senate, the Fox News Senate Power Rankings lists Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Arizona and Nevada as the five most competitive races. Of those races, Democrats in three states won by Trump are defending their seats. Republicans feel more confident about keeping control of the Senate – or possibly adding to their majority. But the threat to the Trump agenda is real if they lose control. Democrats have a narrow path to the majority if they run the table in the toss-ups and pick off one GOP-favored seat, like Texas or Tennessee. If Democrats win control of both houses of Congress, they could send legislation to Trump’s desk. And, in the Senate, they would have the votes to block any of Trump's nominees – coming after Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s brutal confirmation fight last month. On the day before America votes, Trump hopscotched to rallies in three battleground states -- in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. In Ohio, Trump campaigned for a slate of Republicans, including Jim Renacci in his bid to unseat Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown. Trump won the state with 52 percent of the vote in 2016 but the Fox News Senate Power Rankings lists that contest as “likely Democrat.” Later Monday, the president flew to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he is hoping to give Republican Mike Braun an assist to defeat incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. He then traveled to Missouri to lend a hand to Josh Hawley in his campaign to beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Meanwhile, in state capitals across the country, Republicans have control of a majority of governorships, holding 33 to the Democrats’ 16 seats. Democrats are likely to pick up at least some seats, with 36 gubernatorial seats up for grabs this year. According to the Fox News Gubernatorial Power Rankings, 15 of the contested seats lean Republican, 13 lean Democrat and eight are tossups. For Republicans, holding on to control of state houses is important, considering that’s where real policy changes may take place if Democrats win control of Congress and Washington effectively deadlocks. Among the most-watched races: Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker is locked in a tight re-election battle with Democratic challenger Tony Evers and Tallahassee Democratic Mayor Andrew Gillum is facing off against Trump-backed GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis in Florida. Though the political environment seems to favor Democrats, Trump argued Monday that Republican voters are energized heading into Tuesday’s vote, saying he hasn’t felt such “electricity” since he was elected president in 2016. "Tomorrow, with your votes, you can stop the radical resistance in its tracks," Trump told the crowd in Cleveland. Fox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report.

USA TODAY Supporters cheer as they watch returns at an election night party for Democrat congressional candidate Jennifer Wexton on Nov. 6, 2018, in Dulles, Virginia. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) WASHINGTON – Democrats gained two House seats in early results Tuesday – ousting a two-term Republican incumbent in Virginia and winning an open seat in Florida held by a retiring GOP lawmaker. In Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, a state senator and former domestic violence prosecutor, toppled incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock. Comstock tried to distance herself from President Donald Trump, but she fell short in a well-to-do suburban district that has become increasingly Democratic. Hillary Clinton won here in 2016 by 10 percentage points, and political handicappers expected Comstock to lose. In Florida, former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, a Democrat, notched a victory in Florida’s 27th District. Shalala beat one of the GOP’s star recruits, former Spanish-language broadcast journalist Maria Elvira Salazar, in a heavily Hispanic district. Democrats targeted the seat after longtime incumbent GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen decided to retire. But in Kentucky, GOP Rep. Andy Barr fought off a stiff challenge from Democrat and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. The district, which includes Lexington and Frankfurt, shouldn’t have been competitive. Trump won it by 15 percentage points in 2016. McGrath turned it into a tight race, attracting national attention with viral TV ads, including one that showcased her 89 combat missions. But the Associated Press declared Barr the winner. Those early results came in the high-stakes fight for control of the House. Heading into Election Day, polling in dozens of congressional races across the country showed they were too close to call. Democrats held a slight advantage to win a majority of House seats, according to the most recent polls, but the final outcome remained unpredictable. “We are going to win tonight," California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, predicted in an interview Tuesday evening with the PBS NewsHour. Also speaking to PBS, Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said it could be a “tough night" but held out hope the GOP could keep its House majority. Democrats need to gain a net 23 House seats to wrest control of the House from Republicans. The battleground stretched across the country – with more than 70 hotly contested races from New Jersey to California. At stake: President Donald Trump’s agenda for the next two years. If Democrats win a majority, they can use Congress’ aggressive oversight powers to demand Trump’s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate alleged corruption across the executive branch. And they can block the president’s legislative priorities, whether it’s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs. If Republicans remain in power, Trump will be able to pursue a sweeping conservative agenda over the next two years – including hard-line immigration policies, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and nixing environmental regulations. The president's party generally loses seats in midterm elections. In 2006, President George W. Bush called the election results “a thumping” when his party lost 30 House seats and six Senate seats, turning control of both chambers over to Democrats and ushering in the first woman House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. President Barack Obama, in 2010, called it a “shellacking” when Democrats lost 63 seats – and control of the House – and six Senate seats amid the rise of the tea party movement Tuesday's results will also set the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign. A GOP victory in this election would put Trump in a strong position to win a second term and cement his control over the Republican Party. A Democratic victory would energize the so-called liberal "resistance" and buoy a party still grappling with Trump’s surprise win in 2016. Trump spent the closing days of the 2018 campaign escalating his anti-immigrant rhetoric and portraying Democrats as soft on immigration. He vowed to close the border with Mexico, claimed a caravan of migrants included unknown “Middle Easterners,” and threatened to build “tent cities” to block people from entering the country. Democrats said Trump was using fear to motivate GOP voters. They channeled much of their energy and ad dollars to talking about health care – blasting Republican for their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and unravel protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Those themes were on voters minds as they went to the polls, according to a Washington Post-Schar School survey of conducted Monday and Tuesday in battleground districts across the country. The survey found that 44 percent of voters said health care was the most important factor in casting their ballot, while 43 percent said Trump was the top issue driving their decision. Immigration and the economy ranked about 10 percentage points lower, the Post-Schar data shows. The first hints of whether Tuesday will bring a blue wave, a red one, or neither, will begin to emerge after polls close in key East Coast and Midwest states, starting after 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. But the full results won’t be available until midnight or later, as voters in California and other Western states finish their balloting. With dozens of toss-up races going down to the wire, the Election Day battle may even stretch out for days, with recounts possible across the country. Here are the key races to watch: More: What's at stake in the midterms? Both sides warn the future of our democracy is at risk A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Virginia's 7th District In Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, Rep. Dave Brat scored a major upset in 2014 when he ousted then-GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Brat is now a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. This election, he is facing off against former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger, and the contest is surprisingly competitive in a district that has been reliably red. President Donald Trump carried this seat by 7 percentage points in 2016, so if Spanberger wins, that portends a good night for Democrats, says Dave Wasserman, the House editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. He said this race is one of the best early bellwethers for how well Democrats perform on Tuesday. New Jersey's 3rd and 7th Districts There are a handful of GOP-held seats that are now competitive across the state. But the two most vulnerable Republicans are Rep. Tom MacArthur (in New Jersey’s 3rd District) and Rep. Leonard Lance (in the state’s 7th). MacArthur helped write the Obamacare repeal bill, which has proved to be a negative for House Republicans. MacArthur also voted for the GOP-led tax cut, which his fellow New Jersey Republicans, and even the state’s chamber of commerce, said would hurt the state. Florida's 26th and 27th Districts A key race in Florida will test the electoral strength of moderate Republicans in swing districts. Rep. Carlos Curbelo has a strong brand as a centrist Republican willing to speak out against the president, but it's not clear if that will be enough for him to hold on to Florida’s 26th Congressional District, which Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won by 16 points. He’s running against former associate dean of Florida International University Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. West Virginia's 3rd District If this district goes blue, it’s likely to be a very, very good night for Democrats. Trump won the district by 73 percentage points, but the GOP incumbent here is retiring, making the race more competitive. Democratic state Sen. Richard Ojeda (a former Trump voter) could pull off a win here by sheer personality. He's a retired Army paratrooper who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, gave out his cell phone number in one of his campaign videos, and promised not to support California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as speaker. State delegate Carol Miller, a bison farmer and social conservative, is running as a Trump-style Republican, with promises to "cut the bull" in Washington. Michigan's 8th District Trump carried this district by 7 percentage points. Rep. Mike Bishop has represented the district, which sits on the edge of Detroit's suburbs, in one way or another for most of the last 20 years. But this year, it’s considered a toss-up. Bishop's Democratic opponent, Elissa Slotkin, is a former defense official in the Obama administration. Minnesota's 1st and 8th Districts Minnesota's 1st and 8th Congressional Districts are both open Democratic seats that went for Trump by double digits in 2016 – in other words, two GOP pickup opportunities in an otherwise difficult climate for Republicans. The 8th District is likely to go for the GOP candidate. But the 1st District is a true toss-up. It’s an agriculture-heavy region hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs, so it will be a good test of how the president’s trade policies are playing in farm country – and whether Trump is still popular with that segment of the electorate. Kansas' 3rd District This was a squeaker district in 2016, with Clinton winning here by just over 1 percentage point and Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder snagging another term. This time around, Yoder has been cut off from his party’s campaign wing because the GOP sees the race as a lost cause. Democrat Sharice Davids, a lawyer and former mixed martial arts fighter, is likely to win this seat, which includes the Kansas City suburbs. She will also make history as an openly gay Native American. Iowa's 1st and 3rd Districts Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is a blue-collar swing seat currently represented by Freedom Caucus Rep. Rod Blum. Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old state representative, is running against Blum, emphasizing her working-class roots. Blum is a businessman-turned-politician who could face a backlash from the president's tariffs. Trump won both the 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts by nearly 4 percentage points. In the 3rd District, GOP Rep. David Young is facing a challenge from small business owner Cindy Axne. The 3rd District includes Des Moines and Council Bluffs and has an equal number of registered Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated, so this contest will turn on independent voters. Texas' 7th and 32nd Districts These wealthy, educated districts in Texas have long been held by the GOP, but both narrowly went for Clinton in 2016, by less than 2 percentage points each. Republican Rep. John Culberson, who represents Houston, is being challenged by Democratic attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. GOP Rep. Pete Sessions’ district includes the Dallas suburbs, where he's facing Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former player for the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. Sessions has not faced a competitive race in years, but the Republican stalwart is now considered the most vulnerable GOP congressman in Texas. Nevada's 3rd District This is one of a handful of open Democratic seats that went for Trump in 2016, although just by 1 percentage point. With incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen's decision to run for the Senate, it's one of a few GOP pickup opportunities this year. Republican businessman Danny Tarkanian almost won the district in 2016, and he has the support of the president in his bid against Democrat Susie Lee, a philanthropist. California's 25th, 39th, 45th, 48th and 49th Districts On the West Coast, Democrats see a golden opportunity to flip several seats that have long been Republican strongholds. The 39th District is open after Foreign Relations Chair Rep. Ed Royce decided to retired. His former aide and former state assemblywoman Young Kim is hoping to take his place. But she faces competition from lottery winner and Democrat Gil Cisneros. California's 49 District is open after Rep. Darrell Issa, the former chair of the House Oversight Committee, said he would not seek re-election. Democrat Mike Levin, a lawyer, faces Republican Diane Harkey, who is chairwoman of the state board that oversees tax administration and is a former mayor. GOP Reps. Mimi Walters, Dana Rohrabacher and Steve Knight are all facing competitive challenges as well.

---split---22.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-midterms-tribal-brawl---split---President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, above with his family, to replace then-Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in the East Room of the White House on July 9. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) ANALYSIS | What ended Monday night inside an arena in southeast Missouri began in earnest on the White House’s South Lawn on Oct. 2. That’s when President Donald Trump decided to do what has defined his presidency and three years on the political stage: He fought back. Trump used a six-day, eight-state, 11-rally barnstorming tour to close out the midterms campaign season by going not just partisan but tribal. His campaign-ending rally in Cape Girardeau was his third stop of the day — and everywhere the president went Monday, he couldn’t stop telling anyone who would listen that the final week of the 2018 campaign reminded him of the 2016 one when he shocked the world by defeating Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “Something’s going on,” Trump said several times at his first stop of the day, in Cleveland, of his feeling — at least publicly — that Republicans are again going to defy expectations on Tuesday when voters head to the polls. “There’s something happening out there, folks,” he said later in Missouri. Notably, Trump said similar things in the final days of his shocking 2016 presidential campaign. But just over a month ago, things looked dire for Trump and Republicans. Polls showed big Democratic gains in the House and a Senate up for grabs. And Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee, now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was facing sexual assault allegations and his fate was in doubt. [Live Blog: Updates from Trump’s Final Day on Campaign Trail] Trump appeared to know he had to do something. So he walked out of the Oval Office and headed straight for reporters waiting on the South Lawn as he was leaving the White House for an evening campaign rally. The president seemed to sense trouble — both in the campaign and for the Kavanaugh nomination, especially if Democrats grabbed the Senate. So he made Senate Democrats’ expressing doubts about Kavanaugh “a rallying cry” for Republicans simply by defending his nominee. It was vintage Trump. The man former campaign manager and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon once declared “a street fighter,” changed the tone of the 2018 campaign with those South Lawn comments and ones he made later that night about Kavanaugh’s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. “How did you get home? I don’t remember. How’d you get there? I don’t remember. Where is the place? I don’t remember. How many years ago was it? I don’t know,” Trump said, flailing his arms around to mock Ford as he has some of his political foes and journalists during similar events in the past. The north Mississippi audience roared its approval. The entire campaign had changed in a span of just a few hours. And he kept it up for the next month. Trump jetted across much of the middle of the country, stopping in places like Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Ohio and Tennessee. He took aim at Democratic candidates, lawmakers and leaders. He warned of “angry mobs” and “radical” Democrats who, he claimed, wanted to install “socialism” and “open borders.” The latter would inevitably bring rampant crimes and a decrease in available federal benefits for American citizens, the president told crowd after crowd in arenas, high school gyms and airport hangars. He made immigration the backbone of his final-days pitch, warning several Central American caravans approaching the U.S.-Mexico border amounts to an “invasion” force that is chock full of violent gang members and criminals without providing supporting evidence. He accused Democrats of wanting to “turn America into Venezuela,” which plunged into an ongoing economic and political crisis stemming from unsustainable social programs launched by Hugo Chavez’s government. “I don’t think so,” he would say as the boos gave way to applause and “U-S-A!” chants. Trump took the gloves off that October day and he didn’t let up as Election Day neared. During an interview with Fox News commentator and host Sean Hannity before the final rally, the president offered some bare-knuckle talk about Florida’s incumbent Democratic senator who is in a Toss-up race with that state’s GOP governor. “Bill Nelson is a terrible senator,” Trump said. “He’s never called me.” Nelson’s opponent, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, has called the president asking for what Trump values most: Money. The Sunshine State has needed federal hurricane relief funds that required presidential approval. [Trump: ‘I Don't Care’ if House Democrats Release My Tax Returns] Trump never tried to use the midterms campaign to bring the country’s tribes together. In fact, he often did the opposite, serving as the straw stirring the volatile cocktail that is a feuding country. Instead, Trump — especially over the race’s final month — chose to orchestrate a campaign that was short on a unifying message and long on misleading statements and tribal rhetoric. Instead, the president zeroed in on the conservative base that put him in the White House and doubled down on the kind of barbed wire-wrapped rhetoric that fired them up two years ago. And speaking of barbed wire, the president said U.S. military forces he sent to the southern border are building “barbed-wire walls” to keep those caravans out. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, a Cape Girardeau native, was the final rally's warm up act. It was fitting since Limbaugh for decades fueled the conservative vitriol and energy that, in many ways, helped Trump capitalize on that group's economic and social angst two years ago. “The bond that exists between you and everyone else who has been to a Trump rally is something every politician envies,” Limbaugh said. What’s more, he added, no one in Washington “has taken the time to learn.” The man who sits behind the "golden EIB microphone" has a point there. There are plenty of signs Limbaugh is correct, like polls that tightened almost as soon as Trump created his “rallying cry” that October afternoon. Voters will have the final say on Tuesday — and, as always, it’s all about Trump — a referendum of sorts on his turbulent and tribal tenure. “In a sense,” he said in Cleveland, “I am on the ticket.” Watch: Obama — “The Character of This Country is on the Ballot” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

She has linked herself to President Donald Trump, borrowing his “America First” slogan for her campaign website. “Wendy Rogers proved she is wholly unqualified to represent the people of Arizona’s First Congressional District by interviewing with an outlet for Russian propaganda,” O’Halleran said in a statement Tuesday. “This is just one more shameful chapter in her career as a professional political candidate. She has spent this entire campaign dodging Arizona reporters and dropping out of televised debates, and voters are noticing.” In the interview, Sputnik News asked Rogers “What impact can the results have on the anti-Russia hysteria that has dominated the Democratic party’s agenda in the elections? What impact did it have on the election results?” “I can tell you, Russia isn’t interfering in Arizona’s 1st district. I haven’t seen any Russians,” she responded. Top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies warned that Russia, China, and Iran are running influence campaigns seeking to sway American voters in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential campaigns. These include “using social media to amplify divisive issues, sponsoring specific content in English-language media like RT and Sputnik, seeding disinformation through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates and disseminating foreign propaganda,” said a statement issued jointly by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security in October. Sputnik was established in 2014 by the Russian state-owned and operated news agency Rossiya Segodnya, which was itself created by an executive order by Vladimir Putin. It produces content in more than 30 languages and has international offices in London, Edinburgh, Washington, Cairo and Beijing. — Gopal Ratnam contributed to this report.

Politics DHS Detects Elections Systems Scanning Homeland Security officials at the Washington elections command post said they had detected some “run-of-the-mill” scanning of elections systems a little past noon on Election Day. Scanning of systems is something many hackers try to do routinely to search for vulnerabilities. In physical terms, scanning is the equivalent to a burglar walking through a neighborhood to see if any of the houses are unlocked. Homeland Security officials said that the scanning activity is fairly normal but they have not yet identified where the scanning is coming from. “At this point, there’s not enough information to tie it back to any single actor,” a Homeland Security official said. “Certainly nothing that would be attributed back to Russia." Homeland Security agents have teamed up with other federal agencies, including the FBI, state and local election officials and representatives from the Republican and Democratic national committees, to monitor the polls and social media, with a close eye on any signs of foreign interference in the midterm elections. The goal is to prevent a repeat of 2016, when Moscow-linked entities inflamed political tensions through ad buys on social media platforms. U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded they scanned elections systems in at least 21 states in an attempt to breach them. Watch: Election Security Expert: ‘It’s Really Only a Matter of Time’ Homeland Security “mission managers” have been on watch for foreign influence attempts since Sept. 21. Last week, the department established a National Situational Awareness Room, where states can share information regarding any attempted hacks or other nefarious activity. As of Tuesday morning, 20 states had logged into the National Situational Awareness Room, but Homeland Security officials said they expect that number to rise throughout the day. The department also set up an unclassified operations center at its headquarters where representatives from the National Association of Secretaries of State, Democratic and Republican national committees, FBI and state election officials can monitor and share information throughout the day. The unclassified center will complement the department’s classified hub, where other federal agencies will keep tabs on the elections. The department also has deployed several hundred officials across the country, with someone from the department in every state to assist the states’ chief election officials identify potential foreign interference and communicate any problems to the public. As of Tuesday morning, the department had yet to see any attempts of election interference through social media or attempted hacks on election infrastructure, but warned that attempts to disrupt American democracy won’t end when the polls close. “The electoral process doesn't stop at midnight tonight,” a Homeland Security official said. “Election counting, the canvassing, the audit process through certification, goes well into, in some cases, December. So we’re going to need to be keeping an eye out for these kinds of influence operations and the efforts to undermine confidence in the electoral process.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Politics The 10 Most Vulnerable House Incumbents on Election Day Heading into Election Day, Republicans once again occupy all 10 spots of Roll Call’s list of most vulnerable House incumbents, but for the first time this cycle, Iowa Rep. Rod Blum is not leading the pack. While President Donald Trump won Blum’s 1st District in 2016, operatives from both parties have consistently identified the two-term congressman as the incumbent most likely to lose this cycle — until the past month. Blum’s race has tightened of late, with outside groups on both sides re-engaging. Democrats and Republicans agree that a handful of GOP incumbents in tougher districts are now in more trouble than him. That begins with Pennsylvania Rep. Keith Rothfus, who tops the list, followed by three Republicans in districts that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. [The 10 Most Vulnerable Senators on Election Day] The rankings are based on conversations with strategists from both sides of the aisle, polling, and the race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. We look solely at vulnerable incumbents and do not include open seats that are likely to flip. Watch: 25 Race Ratings Changes Less Than a Week Before Midterms Rothfus’ fate was complicated by a new Pennsylvania congressional map. His district shifted from one Trump carried by 21 points to one that would have supported him by just 3 points. Rep. Conor Lamb’s decision to challenge Rothfus in the new 17th District further complicated matters, since the Democrat brought high name recognition and a lot of money to the race. There has been minimal outside spending here, according to a Daily Kos Elections analysis, which is a sign that Republicans view the race as essentially a lost cause. Race Rating: Leans Democratic Coffman has beaten back previous Democratic attempts to unseat him, but his prospects look bleaker this year. Some Republicans admit the 6th District race has moved away from them, and the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled its money here last month. Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by House GOP leadership, cut its spending in September. Coffman, a Marine veteran, faces Democratic Army veteran Jason Crow in a district that Clinton carried by 9 points. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Clinton only won Yoder’s 3rd District by 1 point in 2016, but Democrats view this year’s race as an example of suburban voters rejecting the GOP agenda, and believe the Republican gubernatorial nominee, conservative firebrand Kris Kobach, could be a drag on Yoder. Democrat Sharice Davids, who is backed by the pro-abortion rights group EMILY’s List, has also proved to be a strong fundraiser who could make history as one of the first Native American women in Congress and the first LGBT representative from Kansas. Race Rating: Leans Democratic The two-term Republican remains where she was last month on the list. Some polling of her race against Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton shows slightly tighter margins than in Coffman and Yoder’s re-elections. Comstock has a history of winning tough races and has worked to distance herself from her party on some issues. But the fundamentals of the 10th District, which Clinton carried by 10 points, remain daunting for the incumbent. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Blum moves down the list as polls have shown his 1st District race getting closer. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee initially pulled out in a show of confidence in state Rep. Abby Finkenauer’s chances of defeating Blum. But they’ve since re-engaged, and CLF jumped in after outside GOP groups declined to spend here for most of the cycle. The district backed former President Barack Obama twice but then supported Trump by less than 4 points. Race Rating: Leans Democratic This is Paulsen’s second straight month on the list, although he’s dropped three spots since October to make way for the races in Clinton districts, where outside groups have cut their losses. Paulsen overperformed Trump in this affluent, suburban Twin Cities district in 2016, but this is his first time running for re-election with a Republican in the White House. Regardless of how much he tries to distance himself from his party, 3rd District voters like splitting their tickets and seem to be receptive to his Democratic challenger, first-time candidate Dean Phillips.Race Rating: Tilts Democratic The freshman Republican returns in seventh position as he faces a rematch against Democrat Angie Craig, whom he narrowly beat in the 2nd District in 2016. Craig’s running a different campaign this year, not talking about Trump or going after Lewis for controversial comments from his talk radio days. Another big difference: the third-party candidate who took nearly 8 percent of the vote two years ago isn’t on the ballot this time. But Lewis may be in slightly better shape than Paulsen given that his district, which narrowly voted for Trump, is more conservative. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Faso remains in the No. 8 spot in the closely divided 19th District, which swung from Obama to Trump. (Faso himself referred to the district as a “microcosm of the country.”) He faces Democratic lawyer Antonio Delgado, who had a slight edge in cash on hand heading into the final weeks of the race. Delgado, who also had a crowded primary, has raised twice as much as Faso throughout the campaign, $7.9 million to Faso’s $3.7 million. Outside groups on both sides are also spending in this upstate New York district. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic The Republican sophomore moves up a spot after debuting on the list last month. While Trump won the rural, working-class 2nd District by 10 points in 2016, it’s still ancestrally Democratic turf and voted twice for Obama. Poliquin faces a tough challenge from Democratic state House Assistant Majority Leader Jared Golden, a Marine veteran who’s been attacking the incumbent for voting to repeal the 2010 health care law. There’s no public polling suggesting Poliquin can win more than 50 percent of the vote, and if he doesn’t, the state’s ranked-choice voting system kicks in, which would likely benefit Golden. Race Rating: Toss-up Tenney moves down a spot in part because party strategists say Poliquin could be in more trouble. The race between Tenney and Democratic state Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi in an upstate New York district Trump carried by 16 points remains close. Brindisi’s brand, name recognition and fundraising has helped put the 22nd District in play for Democrats. Tenney’s closing argument includes aligning herself with Trump and attempting to tie Brindisi to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whom he has said he will not support for speaker.Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics The 10 Most Vulnerable Senators on Election Day Democrats continue to dominate Roll Call’s list of the year’s most vulnerable senators, but one Democrat in a state President Donald Trump won has fallen off since our last rankings a month ago. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin is no longer in the Top 10, with operatives on both sides noting the Badger State contest has been slipping away from Republicans. With Baldwin dropping off, Texas Republican Ted Cruz and New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez move up, although both are still favored to win re-election. A new addition to the list is Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat who’s running in a special election to fill out the remainder of former Sen. Al Franken’s term less than a year after she was appointed to the seat. [The 10 Most Vulnerable House Incumbents on Election Day] Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, still facing a tough race in a GOP-leaning state, remains in the top spot. Her other vulnerable party colleagues in states Trump won by double digits also stay put, including Missouri’s Claire McCaskill (No. 3) and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly (No. 4). The highest-ranked Republican on the list is Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who again comes in second. The rankings are based on conversations with strategists from both sides of the aisle, polling, and the race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. We look solely at vulnerable incumbents and do not include open seats that are likely to flip. Watch: 25 Race Ratings Changes Less Than a Week Before Midterms The broader dynamics of a GOP-leaning state are working against the first-term senator and in favor of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer. That’s especially the case after Heitkamp voted not to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But the high court fight energized both sides, and Democrats say the incumbent’s strength as a candidate and fundraising advantage shouldn’t be discounted. North Dakota remains a red state, though, with Heitkamp the only remaining member of her party in statewide elected office. Race Rating: Leans Republican Heller has never lost a race in his long political career. But as the only GOP senator running for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he’s still the most vulnerable Republican. He’s locked in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who has held a slight edge in some recent public polling (in a state where Democrats believe their voters are often undersampled in surveys). With the national environment also likely to bolster Rosen and early ballot returns favoring Democrats, Heller stays near the top of the list. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Republicans feel the race to unseat McCaskill is starting to move in their direction. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has focused much of his campaign on the push for conservative judges. McCaskill has pressed Hawley on health care, particularly on protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is traveling to Missouri on Monday to try and boost Republicans in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. Race Rating: Tilts Republican This race has tightened in favor of GOP nominee Mike Braun over the last month. Several factors are at play here, only one of which may be the Kavanaugh effect. (Donnelly voted against confirming the Supreme Court justice, likely losing support among some GOP and independent voters.) While some Republicans may have naturally come home, Braun has also finally put more of his own money into the race and seems to have stepped harder on the gas after running a lackluster campaign for much of the summer. Still, Donnelly is running close to Trump in a state the president carried by nearly 20 points, and Democrats are continuing to go after Braun over his business record and health care. Race Rating: Toss-up While the outlook for many Democrats running in Trump states has worsened this fall, Nelson’s odds seem to have improved over the past couple of months. He remains at No. 5, just where he was in October. Florida is more Democratic than most states on this list, which is why outside groups have been attacking the GOP nominee, Gov. Rick Scott, by tying him to Trump. The national environment could end up boosting Nelson, as could the coattails of gubernatorial standard-bearer Andrew Gillum. Scott has received plenty of earned media from this year’s hurricanes, but he and his allies have spent big in this expensive state and haven’t been able to put away the race. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Trump’s repeated visits to Big Sky Country — a state he won by 21 points — have helped nationalize this race, which is a good thing for the GOP nominee, state Auditor Matt Rosendale. Tester continues to lean into his brand (have you heard, he has seven fingers?) while going after Rosendale on health care, public lands and his Maryland roots. Tester has never won a Senate race with more than 50 percent. The Libertarian Party candidate appeared to throw his support to Rosendale last week, but it’s not clear if this shifts the race further away from the two-term senator. Tester remains where he was last month. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Manchin’s personal brand in West Virginia continues to protect him, with Republicans largely conceding he’s out of reach. The former governor’s current ranking is several spots lower than where he was when the cycle began. Manchin will always be at risk in a state Trump carried by 42 points, but GOP state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey hasn’t been able to effectively go after him, in part because of his own ties to Washington and the pharmaceutical industry. Manchin, meanwhile, has zeroed in on Morrisey’s support for a lawsuit against the 2010 health care law. Race Rating: Tilts Democratic Cruz still looks likely to win re-election, but with Baldwin falling off the list, he moves up to No. 8. At this point, polling shows a closer race in Texas than other Trump states such as Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Democrats are also defending seats. Cruz’s well-funded Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, shattered a fundraising record by raking in $38 million in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30. While O’Rourke is running closer to Cruz than expected and can compete on TV, Cruz has been holding steady at around 50 percent in recent polls. Race Rating: Likely Republican. Since Menendez’s first appearance on this list last month (at No. 10), national Democratic groups have poured millions more into New Jersey. The two-term senator is up against Republican Bob Hugin, who’s put nearly $30 million of his own money into the race. But Menendez still leads in every poll from this blue state. Even if voters are turned off by his ethical quandaries, they’re not likely to ditch him for a retired pharmaceutical executive who’s run a largely negative campaign. Race Rating: Likely Democratic The appointed Minnesota senator finds herself on this list for the first time, largely because a handful of Democrats facing re-election in Trump states have fallen off. Smith is running in the one Upper Midwest state that Trump did not carry in 2016, and she continues to lead GOP state Sen. Karin Housley — although sometimes by single digits — in public polling of the special election. National Democrats made a last-minute investment here last week, but that’s likely an insurance policy since Smith got a late start and wasn’t very well-known from her previous role as lieutenant governor.

Heard on the Hill This Is Jackie Speier’s Survival Guide, Timed for Election Day Jackie Speier is no stranger to political violence. During the Jonestown massacre of 1978, cult members shot her at point-blank range — and that was just the beginning. Death threats. Scars. A male colleague at the statehouse who, after hearing her speak on abortion, told her menacingly, “Jim Jones didn’t finish the job.” The California Democrat, now a congresswoman and #MeToo torchbearer, has shared many of these stories before. Yet this time something feels different. Timed to coincide with an election that has seen a historic influx of female candidates, Speier’s new memoir starts to read less like a memoir and more like a survival guide for women who dare to run for office. “In many ways it’s a chapter closer for me; 40 years after one defining moment in my life followed by many more unexpected turning points,” Speier said of “Undaunted,” which comes out on Election Day. “Now seemed like a good time to impart everything I’ve experienced in my life that has brought me to where I am today.” Speier started her political career as a “Ryan Girl,” which meant she wore a cute outfit to campaign for the late California Rep. Leo Ryan, who was eventually murdered in Jonestown. Her feminism took root as she thought about the “hardy women” in her life and endured sexual assault as a Capitol Hill staffer. [Congresswoman Left for Dead at Jonestown Recalls the Massacre, 37 Years Later] She writes candidly about dating with scars on her body, a fiancé’s infidelity, an aborted pregnancy, a miscarriage, and a failed attempt at adoption. Those events helped shape her policy positions on abortion and women’s health. As for her position on child care, that was shaped by her first husband’s fatal car accident, the financial instability that followed as a single mother, and working a job that took her 3,000 miles from her kids. Getting to Congress was no easy task either. When she first ran to replace Ryan right after his death, voters — even women — told her that her gender was a dealbreaker. She lost that race. None of this is meant to dissuade women from entering the political sphere; instead, Speier sees speaking out and resilience as the key ingredients to success. “I want young women and not-so-young women to know the power of sharing their stories; to feel encouraged to make their voices heard. Ultimately, I want ‘Undaunted’ to deliver a message of hope,” the congresswoman said. “Hard knocks are inevitable but they can open doors that help us to develop valuable qualities — resolve, commitment, purpose.” The 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings and the testimony of accuser Anita Hill were a “clarion call” for her to keep fighting for women, she said. After years in California’s state legislature, she had considered leaving politics. But in 2008 she ran for the open congressional seat of the late Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos, the same one once held by her murdered boss. This time she won. When she got to Congress, there were fewer than 80 women in the House. Now there are a handful more. Even if that changes on Tuesday, it probably won’t be by much; men are still favored to take around three-quarters of the House seats, according to Rutgers’ Center for Women and Politics. “Undaunted: Surviving Jonestown, Summoning Courage, and Fighting Back” comes out Nov. 6 from Little A, an imprint of Amazon Publishing.

Politics Virginia’s 5th District A Sign of Democrats’ Expanding House Battlefield MADISON, Va. — If Democrat Leslie Cockburn wins the open seat in Virginia’s 5th District Tuesday, the wave election Democrats have hoped for will be in full effect. The district is part of an expanding Democratic battlefield this cycle, as the party eyes long-held Republican seats that are a stretch to win but ones they feel are gettable with the right candidate and the right investment. Cockburn, a former investigative journalist, was always the right candidate to local Democrats, but the national party was late to provide support. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee only added Cockburn to its Red to Blue program for strong recruits last month. She still faces long odds against Republican distillery owner and Air Force veteran Denver Riggleman in a district President Donald Trump won by 11 points in 2016. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race Likely Republican. Cockburn and the Democratic Party have poured millions into the district in hopes that she will be the first woman elected to Congress in Virginia’s 5th. She has outraised Riggleman 2:1 so far this cycle — $2.8 million to $1.4 million through Oct. 17 — but she started running before him. Riggleman entered the race after freshman GOP Rep. Tom Garrett announced in late May he would not seek re-election as he addresses an alcohol addiction. The Republican candidate says he did not spend a dime to win the party’s nomination to run for the seat. Cockburn, meanwhile, had been running before Garrett decided to retire and was competing against other Democrats for the party’s nomination. Democrats opted to hold a caucus nominating convention for the seat over a traditional primary. Cockburn doesn’t think money will be the deciding factor in the race. It’s her efforts to build a grassroots network of supporters and volunteers in all the district’s 21 counties that she believes will help get out the vote on her behalf. “In the 5th district, it is the only way to win,” she said. “You need strong organizations in every county. And we saw this from the very beginning.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said the district “is pretty red” but he believes it’s winnable this year in part because of the circumstances under which the seat became open. Running for the party’s nomination, Cockburn realized early that having “fanatical supporters” in each city and county would help her “That group of supporters in all of the jurisdictions just immediately became like her turnout, her volunteer base,” Kaine said. He recalled the high turnout at a volunteer training he attended with her in Charlottesville, saying, “I’m not used to seeing that many volunteers that the House candidates put together.” Obama: ‘The Character of This Country is on the Ballot’ In the final stretch of the race Cockburn held events in counties across the district — like one here in Madison Friday morning — to get volunteers to sign up for canvassing and phone banking. Kaine headlined a get out the vote event with her in Charlottesville Thursday, and on Friday Cockburn was joined by former Rep. Tom Perriello, the last Democrat to represent the district, and Ben Cullop, who ran against her for the party’s nomination. Meanwhile, Riggleman held events with high-profile Republicans. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney campaigned for him Thursday night in Lynchburg and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stumped for him Friday in Warrenton. “Typically midterms don’t get the highest turnouts; I think we’re going to defy history in this election cycle,” Scalise said at the Lynchburg event, predicting a victory for Riggleman and House Republicans. Riggleman said he felt good about his prospects, despite not having a political background and having only been in the race for five months. He talked about his journey from being the oldest of eight kids that grew up on welfare to the owner of a distillery business. While Riggleman noted that his military career was always spent “behind the door,” he promised his congressional career would be in front of it. “I will be the most transparent, honest person that you’ve ever met,” he said. If I mess up, I’ll let you know. If I do well, I’ll probably let you know too.” Cockburn also talked about transparency at her get-out-the-vote events Friday, noting that she’s got permission to remove the hinges to the door of her future congressional office so long as she puts it back. If elected, she plans to form advisory groups with constituents from across the district to provide input on major legislation. “We’re going to be in touch constantly,” she told supporters in Stanardsville Friday. Mark Heinicke, who attended that event, said that Greene County has always been a stronghold for Democrats in the district with its spill-over from the nearby college town of Charlottesville, but that the enthusiasm this cycle is unlike anything he’s seen before. “I’ve been canvassing since 2008; I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said. Volunteers in Madison and Fluvanna Counties said the same thing, citing voters’ frustrations with Trump and his rhetoric and concerns about health care. “They’re seeing that the Republicans are not stepping up,” Locusdale resident Ann Ridgeway said of her interactions with voters in Madison County. While the county will never be blue, she said there are some independent and Republican voters she met that are planning to vote for Cockburn. But Republicans in the district aren’t worried, saying Riggleman has done well raising money and messaging. One of Riggleman’s best assets is how well he listens, said Melvin Adams, chairman of Virginia’s 5th District Republican Committee. “When he connects with people and you take him out and introduce him to people across the district, he’s authentic, he listens, he engages and then he takes those conversations and he truly implements them into how he can help people in the district,” Adams said. John Miska, a veteran who’s known Riggleman for several years, said his experience in the military and as a business owner have provided him with experience that would serve him well in Congress. “He has management skills that have been tried and tested,” he said.

A previous Web introduction to this story referred to 18 school shootings. While 18 shootings have taken place on school property, not all of them were described as targeted events.

In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.

It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.

A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time.

The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published.

---split---41.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blame-abc-news-finds-17-cases-invoking-trump/story?id=58912889---split---President Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for inciting violence in American communities, dismissing critics who have pointed to his rhetoric as a potential source of inspiration for some citizens acting on bigoted beliefs. Little more than a week ago, he insisted he deserves "no blame" for what he called the "hatred" seemingly coursing through parts of the country, and outside of the White House on Friday, Trump accused news outlets of fomenting the very violence they've been asking him about. But a nationwide review conducted by ABC News has identified at least 17 criminal cases where Trump's name was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault. Nearly all -- 16 of 17 -- cases identified by ABC News are striking in that court documents and direct evidence reflect someone echoing presidential rhetoric, not protesting it. ABC News was unable to find any such case echoing presidential rhetoric when Barack Obama or George W. Bush were in the White House. The perpetrators and suspects identified in the 17 cases are mostly white men, as young as teenagers and as old as 68, while the victims represent an array of minority groups -- African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims and gay men. Federal law enforcement authorities have privately told ABC News they worry that -- even with Trump's public denunciations of violence -- Trump's style could inspire violence-prone individuals to take action against minorities or others they perceive to be against the president's agenda.   While asserting that "fake" media coverage is exacerbating divisions in the country, Trump has noted that "a fan" of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opened fire on Republican lawmakers playing baseball in a Washington suburb last year. "Nobody puts ... 'Bernie Sanders' in the headline with the maniac," Trump said last week. But there's no indication the shooter mentioned Sanders while launching his attack, and no criminal case was ever brought because he was fatally shot during his assault. In identifying the 17 Trump-related cases, ABC News excluded incidents where charges were never brought and incidents of Trump-inspired vandalism. In conducting its review, ABC News did find several cases where pro-Trump defendants were charged with targeting minorities, or where speculation online suggested the defendants were motivated by Trump, but in those cases ABC News found no police records, court proceedings or other direct evidence presenting a definitive link to the president. So those cases also were excluded in the ABC News tally. ABC News found at least one case out of Chicago featuring anti-Trump rhetoric in connection with violence. On Thursday, ABC News sent a list of the cases it identified to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders for comment. As of Sunday evening, three days later, she had yet to respond. Trump has previously told reporters he's "committed to doing everything" in his power to not let political violence "take root in America." Here are the cases identified by ABC News:   AUG. 19, 2015: In Boston, after he and his brother beat a sleeping homeless man of Mexican descent with a metal pole, Steven Leader, 30, told police "Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported." The victim, however, was not in the United States illegally. The brothers, who are white, ultimately pleaded guilty to several assault-related charges and were each sentenced to at least two years in prison. DEC. 5, 2015: After Penn State University student Nicholas Tavella, 19, was charged with "ethnic intimidation" and other crimes for threatening to "put a bullet" in a young Indian man on campus, his attorney argued in court that Tavella was just motivated by "a love of country," not "hate." "Donald Trump is running for President of the United States saying that, 'We've got to check people out more closely,'" Tavella's attorney argued in his defense. Tavella, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to ethnic intimidation and was sentenced to up to two years in prison.   APRIL 28, 2016: When FBI agents arrested 61-year-old John Martin Roos in White City, Oregon, for threatening federal officials, including then-President Barack Obama, they found several pipe bombs and guns in his home. In the three months before his arrest, Roos posted at least 34 messages to Twitter about Trump, repeatedly threatening African Americans, Muslims, Mexican immigrants and the "liberal media," and in court documents, prosecutors noted that the avowed Trump supporter posted this threatening message to Facebook a month earlier: "The establishment is trying to steal the election from Trump. ... Obama is already on a kill list ... Your [name] can be there too." Roos, who is white, has since pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered explosive device and posting Internet threats against federal officials. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison. JUNE 3, 2016: After 54-year-old Henry Slapnik attacked his African-American neighbors with a knife in Cleveland, he told police "Donald Trump will fix them because they are scared of Donald Trump," according to police reports. Slapnik, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to "ethnic intimidation" and other charges. It's unclear what sentence he received. AUG. 16, 2016: In Olympia, Washington, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe attacked a white woman and a black man with a knife after seeing them kiss on a popular street. When police arrived on the scene, Rowe professed to being "a white supremacist" and said "he planned on heading down to the next Donald Trump rally and stomping out more of the Black Lives Matter group," according to court documents filed in the case. Rowe, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to charges of assault and malicious harassment, and he was sentenced to more than four years in prison.   SEPT. 1, 2016: The then-chief of the Bordentown, New Jersey, police department, Frank Nucera, allegedly assaulted an African-American teenager who was handcuffed. Federal prosecutors said the attack was part of Nucera's "intense racial animus," noting in federal court that "within hours" of the assault, Nucera was secretly recorded saying "Donald Trump is the last hope for white people." The 60-year-old Nucera has been indicted by a federal grand jury on three charges, including committing a federal hate crime. Nucera, who is white, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He retired last year. SEPTEMBER 2016: After 40-year-old Mark Feigin of Los Angeles was arrested for posting anti-Muslim and allegedly threatening statements to a mosque's Facebook page, his attorney argued in court that the comments were protected by the First Amendment because Feigin was "using similar language and expressing similar views" to "campaign statements from then-candidate Donald Trump." Noting that his client "supported Donald Trump," attorney Caleb Mason added that "Mr. Feigin's comments were directed toward a pressing issue of public concern that was a central theme of the Trump campaign and the 2016 election generally: the Islamic roots of many international and U.S. terrorist acts." Feigin, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sending harassing communications electronically. He was sentenced to probation. OCT. 13, 2016: After the FBI arrested three white Kansas men for plotting to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, where many Somali immigrants lived, one of the men's attorneys insisted to a federal judge that the plot was "self-defensive" because the three men believed "that if Donald Trump won the election, President Obama would not recognize the validity of those results, that he would declare martial law, and that at that point militias all over the country would have to step in." Then, after a federal grand jury convicted 47-year-old Patrick Stein and the two other men of conspiracy-related charges, Stein's attorney argued for a lighter sentence based on "the backdrop" of Stein's actions: Trump had become "the voice of a lost and ignored white, working-class set of voters" like Stein, and the "climate" at the time could propel someone like Stein to "go to 11," attorney Jim Pratt said in court. Stein and his two accomplices are awaiting sentencing. NOV. 3, 2016: In Tampa, Florida, David Howard threatened to burn down the house next to his "simply because" it was being purchased by a Muslim family, according to the Justice Department. He later said under oath that while he harbored a years-long dislike for Muslims, the circumstances around the home sale were "the match that lit the wick." He cited Trump's warnings about immigrants from majority-Muslim countries. "[With] the fact that the president wants these six countries vetted, everybody vetted before they come over, there's a concern about Muslims," Howard said. Howard, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights violation, and the 59-year-old was sentenced to eight months in prison. NOV. 12, 2016: In Grand Rapids, Michigan, while attacking a cab driver from East Africa, 23-year-old Jacob Holtzlander shouted racial epithets and repeatedly yelled the word, "Trump," according to law enforcement records. Holtzlander, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of ethnic intimidation, and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail. JAN. 3, 2017: In Chicago, four young African-Americans -- sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper -- tied up a white, mentally disabled man and assaulted him, forcing him to recite the phrases "F--k Donald Trump" and "F--k white people" while they broadcast the attack online. Each of them ultimately pleaded guilty to committing a hate crime and other charges, and three of them were sentenced to several years in prison. JAN. 25, 2017: At JFK International Airport in New York, a female Delta employee, wearing a hijab in accordance with her Muslim faith, was "physically and verbally" attacked by 57-year-old Robin Rhodes of Worcester, Mass., "for no apparent reason," prosecutors said at the time. When the victim asked Brown what she did to him, he replied: "You did nothing, but ... [Expletive] Islam. [Expletive] ISIS. Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you." Rhodes ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of "menacing," and he was sentenced to probation. FEB. 19, 2017: After 35-year-old Gerald Wallace called a mosque in Miami Gardens, Florida, and threatened to "shoot all y'all," he told the FBI and police that he made the call because he "got angry" from a local TV news report about a terrorist act. At a rally in Florida the day before, Trump falsely claimed that Muslim refugees had just launched a terrorist attack in Sweden. WATCH WALLACE'S INTERVIEW WITH THE FBI AND POLICE:   Wallace's attorney, Katie Carmon, later tried to convince a federal judge that the threat to kill worshippers could be "protected speech" due to the "very distinctly political climate" at the time. "There are courts considering President Trump's travel ban ... and the president himself has made some very pointed statements about what he thinks about people of this descent," Carmon argued in court. HEAR CARMON'S REMARKS IN COURT:   Wallace, who is African American, ultimately pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of his victims' religious beliefs, and he was sentenced to one year in prison. FEB. 23, 2017: Kevin Seymour and his partner Kevin price were riding their bicycles in Key West, Florida, when a man on a moped, 30-year-old Brandon Davis of North Carolina, hurled anti-gay slurs at them and "intentionally" ran into Seymour's bike, shouting, "You live in Trump country now," according to police reports and Davis' attorney. Davis ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of battery evidencing prejudice, but in court, he expressed remorse and was sentenced to four years of probation. MAY 3, 2017: In South Padre Island, Texas, 35-year-old Alexander Jennes Downing of Waterford, Connecticut, was captured on cell phone video taunting and aggressively approaching a Muslim family, repeatedly shouting, "Donald Trump will stop you!" and other Trump-related remarks. Police arrested downing, of Waterford, Connecticut, for public intoxication. It's unclear what came of the charge. AUGUST 2018: After the Boston Globe called on news outlets around the country to resist what it called "Trump's assault on journalism," the Boston Globe received more than a dozen threatening phone calls. "You are the enemy of the people," the alleged caller, 68-year-old Robert Chain of Encino, California, told a Boston Globe employee on Aug. 22. "As long as you keep attacking the President, the duly elected President of the United States ... I will continue to threat[en], harass, and annoy the Boston Globe." A week later, authorities arrested Chain on threat-related charges. After a hearing in his case, he told reporters, "America was saved when Donald J. Trump was elected president." He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. LATE OCTOBER 2018: Over the course of a week, Florida man Cesar Sayoc allegedly mailed at least 15 potential bombs to prominent critics of Trump and members of the media. Sayoc had been living in a van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, and he had posted several pro-Trump messages on social media. While federal prosecutors have accused him of "domestic terrorism" and filed several bomb-related and assault charges against him, he has pleaded not guilty. ABC News' Luke Barr, Karen Travers, Meredith McGraw and Alexis Scott contributed to this report.
---split---48.0---split---https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/volatility-has-become-new-normal-american-politics-n931986---split---All of the attention on control of Congress, the individual races, and President Donald Trump’s campaign activity has obscured a much bigger story at play in American politics — we’re on the cusp of the House changing hands for a third time in the last 12 years (2006, 2010, 2018?). Another way to look at it: This could very well be the fourth-straight change midterm election, where at least one chamber of Congress flips (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018?). We haven’t seen this level of volatility since after World War II, when control of the House changed hands several times in the 1940s and 1950s. And like after World War II and the Great Depression, this country is in the midst of a political realignment that has created this volatility. The contested 2000 presidential election. 9/11. The Iraq War. The Great Recession. Obama. Trump. We don’t know if Democrats will win control of Congress in tonight’s election, although they’re the strong favorites to regain the House. But we do know how volatile — and divided — our politics have become. And whichever party wins tonight will have just won a battle and not the war in these politically volatile times. For all of tonight’s central questions (Which party controls Congress? Does Trump get rebuked or rewarded? Just how big is that gender gap?), this might be the most fascinating one of all: What was the better political bet in 2018 — playing to the base or to the middle? Trump and GOP strategists made it all about that base; just see Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh at last night’s rally with Trump in Missouri. But Democrats — especially in the Senate races in red/purple states like Arizona, Indiana, Missouri, Montana and Tennessee — focused their messages on the middle of the electorate. Maybe the best example of this base-versus-middle divide is the 50-50 Senate race in Arizona between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema (whose message was aimed at the middle) and Republican Martha McSally (who was playing more to the Trump base in this traditional GOP state). Be sure to see how independents break in Arizona and nationally. If Democrats are winning them by more than 10 points — our NBC/Marist poll of Arizona had Sinema up more than 20 points among indies — it’s hard to see how they aren’t going to win across the country. On the other hand, if those independent margins are smaller and if GOP turnout and enthusiasm are through the roof, then that base approach will have been the smarter play One of the hallmarks of Trump’s two years in office is how he’s focused almost exclusively on his base — the 40 percent to 45 percent of voters who approve of his job — at the expense of the rest of the electorate, including the middle. Does the middle still exist in American politics? Or is it all about that base? We’ll find out tonight. Here’s a related question on our mind: Which Democrats will have more success — the Dems in red/purple states who played more to the middle like Sinema in Arizona, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Phil Bredesen in Tennessee? Or the Dems in red/purple states who made bolder appeals to their base — Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Beto O’Rourke in Texas? As for the battle for the House, we’re re-upping our road map how Democrats get to the net 23 seats they need to win control of Congress: First thing’s first: Democrats aren’t playing defense very many places, and they can probably afford to (and expect to) lose a few seats. Here are six they currently hold and are most likely to lose. (In order of final poll closing time — all times ET) NH-1 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Carol Shea-Porter (D). Eddie Edwards (R) v. Chris Pappas (D). Seat went 48-46 for Trump. PA-14 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Conor Lamb (D) who is running in a new district. Guy Reschenthaler (R) v. Bibiana Boerio (D). Redistricted. New seat estimated to be Trump +29. (Note: Due to redistricting, this is expected to flip) MN-1 (9pm): OPEN — previously held by Tim Walz (D). Jim Hagedorn (R) v. Dan Feehan (D). Seat went 53-38 for Trump. MN-8 (9pm): OPEN —previously held by Rick Nolan (D). Pete Stauber (R) v. Joe Radinovich (D). Seat went 54-38 for Trump. NV-3 (10pm): OPEN — previously held by Jacky Rosen (D). Danny Tarkanian (R) v. Susie Lee (D). Seat went 48-47 for Trump. NV-4 (10pm): OPEN — previously held by Ruben Kihuen (D). Crescent Hardy (R) v. Steven Horsford (D). 50-45 for Clinton. Strategists on both sides of the aisle believe that these races are most likely to flip from Republican to Democratic. Democrats aim to get almost all of these seats in the hunt for a majority. VA-10 (7pm): Incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) v. Jennifer Wexton (D). Seat went 52-42 for Clinton. FL-27 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R). Maria Salazar (R) v. Donna Shalala (D). 58-39 for Clinton. NJ-2 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Frank LoBiondo (R). Seth Grossman (R) v. Jeff Van Drew (D). 50-46 for Trump. KS-3 (8pm): Incumbent Kevin Yoder (R) v. Sharice Davids (D). Seat went 47-46 for Clinton. NJ-11 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Rodney Frelinghuysen (R). Jay Webber (R) v. Mikie Sherrill (D). 48-47 for Trump. PA-5 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Patrick Meehan (R). Redistricted. Pearl Kim (R) v. Mary Gay Scanlon (D). New seat estimated to be Clinton +28. (Note: due to redistricting, this is extremely likely to flip) PA-6 (8pm): OPEN — previously held by Ryan Costello (R). Redistricted. Gregory Michael McCauley (R) v. Chrissy Houlahan (D). New seat estimated to be Clinton +9. (Note: due to redistricting, this is extremely likely to flip) PA-7 (8pm): OPEN —previously held by Charlie Dent (R). Redistricted. Marty Nothstein (R) v. Susan Wild (D). New seat estimated to be Clinton +1. PA-17 (8pm): Incumbent Keith Rothfus (R) vs. Conor Lamb (D). Redistricted. New seat estimated to be Trump +1. AZ-2 (9pm): OPEN — previously held by Martha McSally (R). Lea Marquez-Peterson (R) vs. Ann Kirkpatrick (D). 49-44 for Clinton CO-6 (9pm): Incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman (R) v. Jason Crow (D). Seat went 50-41 for Clinton. MN-2 (9pm): Incumbent Jason Lewis (R) v. Angie Craig (D). Seat went 46-45 for Trump. MN-3 (9pm): Incumbent Erik Paulsen (R) v. Dean Phillips (D). Seat went 50-41 for Clinton. IA-1 (10pm): Incumbent Rod Blum (R) v. Abby Finkenauer (D). Seat went 48-45 for Trump. CA-49 (11pm): OPEN — previously held by Darrell Issa(R). Diane Harkey (R) v. Mike Levin (D). Seat went for 50-43 for Clinton. These are mostly toss-up races with recent momentum for Democrats. If Democrats have won all of the “probable flips” and lost only two of their own Dem-held seats, they need ten of the below to win the majority. KY-6 (6pm): Incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R) v. Amy McGrath (D). Seat went 55-39 for Trump. FL-26 (7pm): Incumbent Carlos Curbelo (R) v. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D). Seat went 56-40 for Clinton. VA-2 (7pm): Incumbent Scott Taylor (R) v. Elaine Luria (D). Seat went 48-45 for Trump. VA-7 (7pm): Incumbent Dave Brat (R) v. Abigail Spanberger (D). Seat went 50-44 for Trump. OH-1 (7:30pm): Incumbent Steve Chabot (R) v. Aftab Pureval (D). Seat went 51-44 for Trump. IL-6 (8pm): Incumbent Peter Roskam (R) v. Sean Casten (D). Seat went 49-42 for Clinton. IL-12 (8pm): Incumbent Rep. Mike Bost (R) v. Brendan Kelly (D). Seat went 54-40 for Trump. ME-2 (8pm): Incumbent Bruce Poliquin (R) v. Jared Golden (D). Seat went 51-41 for Trump. MI-8 (8pm): Incumbent Mike Bishop (R) v. Elissa Slotkin (D). Seat went 50-44 for Trump. MI-11 (9pm): OPEN — previously held by Dave Trott (R). Lena Epstein (R) v. Haley Stevens (D). Seat went 49-45 for Trump. NJ-3 (8pm): Incumbent Tom MacArthur (R) v. Andy Kim (D). Seat went 51-45 for Trump. NJ-7 (8pm): Incumbent Leonard Lance (R) v. Tom Malinowski (D). Seat went 48-47 for Clinton. PA-1 (8pm): Incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick (R) v. Scott Wallace. (D). Redistricted. New district estimated to be Clinton +2. TX-7 (8pm): Incumbent John Culberson (R) v. Lizzie Fletcher (D). Seat went 48-47 for Clinton. TX-32 (8pm): Incumbent Pete Sessions (R) v. Colin Allred (D). Seat went 48-46 for Clinton. NM-2 (9pm): OPEN — previously held by Steve Pearce (R). Yvette Herrell (R) v. Xochitl Torres Small. 50-40 for Trump. NY-19 (9pm): Incumbent John Faso (R) v. Antonio Delgado (D). Seat went 50-44 for Trump. NY-22 (9pm): Incumbent Claudia Tenney (R) v. Anthony Brindisi (D). Seat went 54-39 for Trump. IA-3 (10pm): Incumbent Rep. David Young (R) v. Cindy Axne (D). Seat went 48-45 for Trump. CA-25 (11pm): Incumbent Steve Knight (R) v. Katie Hill (D). Seat went 50-43 for Clinton. CA-45 (11pm): Incumbent Mimi Walters (R) v. Katie Porter (D). Seat went 49-44 for Clinton. CA-48 (11pm): Incumbent Dana Rohrabacher (R) v. Harley Rouda (D). Seat went 48-46 for Clinton. WA-8 (11pm): OPEN — previously held by Dave Reichert (R). Dino Rossi (R) v. Kim Schrier (D). Seat went 46-43 for Clinton. The Wave-Builders (18) These are races that will help determine if Democrats have a relatively slim majority or a more substantial one. More than a few wins here means that we’re probably heading for a 35+ Dem pickup. VA-5 (7 p.m.): OPEN — previously held by Tom Garrett (R). Denver Riggleman (R) v. Leslie Cockburn. Seat went 53-44 for Trump. FL-15 (7 p.m.): OPEN – previously held by Dennis Ross (R). Ross Spano (R) v. Kristen Carlson. Seat went 53-43 for Trump FL-16 (7 p.m.): Incumbent Vern Buchanan (R) v.

If several of these races are close or breaking Democrats’ way, expect an historic wave. AR-2 AZ-6 CA-4 CA-21 FL-6 FL-18 GA-6 (you could make a good argument to move this race to Wave-Builders) GA-7 IN-2 IA-4 MI-1 MO-2 NY-1 NY-2 NY-11 NY-27 OH-14 PA-10 TX-21 For all of the attention on control of the House and Senate, don’t forget about the gubernatorial contests, as well as the races for state legislature. Currently, Republicans hold 33 governorships, Democrats hold 16 and there’s one independent (Bill Walker in Alaska, who dropped out of his race). This election cycle features 36 gubernatorial contests, giving Democrats the chance to pull even with Republicans in governorships — particularly in key presidential battleground states like Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. NBC’s Alex Seitz-Wald: “Voters may reject President Donald Trump and the nationalist vision for America he's championed in the closing weeks of the race, or they could signal assent by returning Republicans to power in both chambers of Congress ... Trump is not on the ballot, but the president has explicitly sought to make this election a referendum on his agenda as he campaigns for Republicans across the country. ‘I need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate so we can continue this incredible movement,’ Trump told supporters in Indiana on Friday.” Chuck Todd is moderator of "Meet The Press" and NBC News' political director.

---split---67.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-2018-exit-poll-analysis-56-percent-country/story?id=59006586---split---As the polls are set to close in many states, preliminary exit poll results show a deep divide along party lines:  Forty-seven percent say Heitkamp’s vote against Brett Kavanaugh is a key factor in their vote, including 55 percent of Republicans and 47 percent of independents, though falling to 36 percent among Democrats. Donald Trump won North Dakota by a 36-point margin in 2016, 63-27 percent. His approval rating there today is 60-39 percent, the second-highest approval rating across exit poll states. Even so, 47 percent of voters say that Trump’s not a factor in their vote, vs. 31 percent of voters who say they’re casting a ballot to support him and 20 percent who say they’re voting to oppose him. Heidi Heitkamp (D) has a 43-53 percent favorability rating – 10 points under water - and is seen as too liberal by 47 percent of voters. Kevin Cramer’s (R) favorability rating is a better 53-42 percent; 40 percent see him as too conservative. More voters in this farm state say that Trump’s trade policies have hurt their local economy, 36 percent, than helped, 23 percent. (34 percent see no impact). And a majority, 52 percent, say the tax cuts have had no impact on their finances. Thirty-nine percent say they’ve become better off financially since Trump took office. Health care ranks first as the top issue (out of four). And voters divide 46-42 percent on whether the Democrats or the Republicans would better protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Changes to voter ID laws raised concerns about American Indians’ voting access. In preliminary results, American Indians account for 2 percent of North Dakota voters, vs. 4 percent in 2008 (the most recent exit poll data in the state). The vote in preliminary data is 38-62 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer, among those citing Heitkamp’s vote against Kavanaugh as an important factor in their decision (47 percent of voters).   Unusually, more than 35 percent of North Dakota Republicans voted for Democratic candidates in the 1990s and early aughts, when Democratic candidates won by 20-point margins. Not so today. Just 7 percent of Republicans are backing Heitkamp. Women went for the Democrat in Senate races by more than 25 points between 1992 and 2006. Today they split 51-48 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer. A bright spot for Heitkamp is the 44 percent who say health care is their top priority of four – she has a +42 advantage among them, 71-29 percent.  Nonwhites account for 41 percent of Texas voters, including 24 percent Latinos. These are highs in Texas midterms in available exit polls back to 1984, and are at or near their record levels, 43 and 24 percent, in the 2016 presidential election. Texas Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 9 points in the 2016 presidential election and 12 points in the 2014 midterms. Today it’s a 5-point gap, 33-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans. (The last time a Democrat won a Senate seat in Texas, in 1988, turnout was +5 Democrats over Republicans.) Texas voters divide 46-49 percent on whether they’d rather see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate. Turnout among liberals, 21 percent, is at a new high – but there are far more conservatives, 43 percent, voting in Texas in this election. Forty-two percent of voters say Beto O’Rourke (D) is too liberal, vs. 38 percent who say Ted Cruz (R) is too conservative. O’Rourke’s favorability rating is 51-41 percent; Cruz’s, 52-46 percent. Thirty-three percent in the longest-border state call Donald Trump’s immigration policies “about right,” and voters divide 48-48 percent on whether they support or oppose a wall across the entire U.S. border with Mexico. Asked the top issue in the vote, 32 percent choose immigration among four issues given, compared with 23 percent nationally. Independents in Texas voted Republican by a 37-point margin in the 2014 midterms. They’re +5 for O’Rourke, 51-46 percent, in these preliminary results. Voters focused on health care – 37 percent of the electorate – are voting 68-31 percent, O’Rourke-Cruz. It’s the 1st-ranked issue out of four in Texas. Among immigration voters, by contrast, it’s 24-75 percent While conservatives predominate, a substantial 36 percent of Texas voters are moderates. They’re voting 64-34 percent, O’Rourke-Cruz. Among the 62 percent of voters in gun households, it’s 37-62 percent, a wide Cruz lead. Twenty-two percent cast a ballot for the first time in a midterm election today, the most of any of the 21 states with exit polls today. They’re voting 52-45 percent, O’Rourke-Cruz. Thirteen percent are younger than 30, voting 71-29 percent, the largest Democratic margin among this group in available exit polls back to 1984, and surpassing their margin in the 2016 presidential election by 23 points. By contrast, seniors, 29 percent of the electorate, are voting 42-58 percent. Nonwhites are voting 69-30 percent, O’Rourke-Cruz. That includes Latinos, 63-35 percent – their largest Democratic margin since 2006 - and blacks, 90-9 percent.    47 percent of voters prefer to keep incumbent Scott Walker’s (R) signature 2011 law eliminating most collective bargaining for public employees; 41 percent would like to see it repealed. (17 percent are from union households, a new low.) Tony Evers (D) is more personally popular than Walker, who’s seeking his third term. Evers has a 53-41 percent favorability rating, compared with 48-51 percent for Walker – 10 points higher on unfavorability. Turnout divides 35-33 percent, Democrats-Republicans, in these preliminary results. That 2-point gap is similar to the last two gubernatorial elections (+1R in 2014, +1D in 2010). In a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, he has a 46-53 percent job approval rating. While just 16 percent of the electorate, nonwhite voters are making up their largest share of voters in available exit polls for Wisconsin gubernatorial races since 1994. Walker won independents by double-digits in his previous gubernatorial victories; in this election Evers is winning them, 54-44 percent. Walker lost moderate voters by 6 points in 2010 and 13 points in 2010. Tonight he’s losing them by more, 19 points, 59-40 percent. Critics of the state’s controversial collective bargaining law, 41 percent of all voters, are backing Evers over Walker by 76-22 percent. Union voters are going 59-38 percent, Evers-Walker; Walker’s 21-point deficit in this group is narrower than in either 2014 (31 points) or 2010 (26 points). Non-college white men are voting broadly for Walker, 40-58 percent.    58 percent of Michigan voters trust Gretchen Whitmer (D) to handle the state’s safe-drinking water issue; just 30 percent trust Bill Schuette (R) to handle it. In a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, his job approval is now 42-57, one of the lowest in the 21 states with exit polls tonight. With Whitmer seeking to become Michigan’s second female governor, 79 percent of voters say it’s important for more women to be elected to public office. About 8 in 10 men and women alike say it’s important. Voters in Michigan are about as likely to say Donald Trump’s trade policies have hurt their local economy as to say they’ve helped, 32-30 percent. And while 64 percent of voters say the national economy is in good shape, fewer, 36 percent, say they are personally better off financially since Trump took office. Whitmer is winning women by 63-36 percent over Schuette in preliminary results. And while outgoing governor Rick Snyder (R) won white women by 9 points in 2014, today Whitmer is winning them by 14 points. Independents backed Trump by 16 points in 2016 and Snyder by 27 points in 2014. Today they’re dividing 50-45 percent, Whitmer-Schuette. 70 percent say the health care system in the United States needs major changes; they’re voting 62-37 percent, Whitmer-Schuette.  In preliminary exit poll results, turnout among nonwhites is a record 40 percent, including 30 percent black voters. The previous high among nonwhites was 36 percent in 2014 – compared with just 18 percent in 1994. Forty-two percent of voters are conservatives, which is typical in Georgia. Liberals account for 20 percent, a new high for a gubernatorial election if it holds. It was 17 percent in 2014. Thirty-nine percent say Stacey Abrams (D) is too liberal; 36 percent say Brian Kemp (R) is too conservative. Donald Trump’s approval rating is 51 percent among Georgia voters, 7 points better than his overall approval nationally. 20 percent say they’re voting to show support for Trump; 15 percent, to oppose him. Seventy percent call it important to elect more women to public office; that compares with 78 percent nationally. There's greater concern about voter suppression than voter fraud, 51-41 percent, a key topic in this contest. While the women’s vote gets a lot of attention, men in Georgia are splitting about evenly, 46-49, Abrams-Kemp. In the last two gubernatorial elections for which we have exit polls (2014 and 2006), the winning Republican candidates won men by 60-37 and 61-34 percent. Independents, historically a swing voter group in Georgia, divide 55-41 percent, Abrams-Kemp. Georgia’s suburban voters are voting 43-54 percent, Abrams-Kemp – including advantages for Kemp among suburban women (46-53 percent) and suburban men (40-54 percent) alike. Libertarian Ted Metz has 3 percent support, worth watching because Georgia requires candidates to get more than 50 percent of the vote to win an election.    Republican Mike Braun is on track to win the Indiana Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls. The race was a test case for Kavanaugh impact: 53 percent call incumbent Joe Donnelly’s (D) vote against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation important in their vote; 19 percent call it a minor factor, 22 percent not a factor at all. We’ll see how they voted after the polls close. Donald Trump has a 52-48 percent approval rating in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. (Native son Mike Pence has a 54-43 percent favorability rating.) Thirty percent say they’re voting to show support for Trump, 34 percent to oppose him, while 32 percent say he’s not a factor. Seventy-three percent of Hoosier voters say the national economy is doing well but local conditions are less broadly positive. Forty-six percent say their own finances have improved since Trump took office, 36 percent say they’ve benefited from the Trump tax law and 29 percent say his trade policies have helped their local economy. Forty-two percent say health care is the top issue of four facing the country. And voters divide 50-44 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect pre-existing condition coverage. Trump’s pushed immigration hard – but it’s the top issue to just 26 percent, far trailing health care. (The economy comes in at 21 percent.) More say that his immigration policies are too tough, 41 percent, than about right, 34 percent, or not tough enough, 21 percent. Donnelly won his seat in 2012 partly on the strength of an 11-point victory among independent voters. Independents are voting 52-40 percent between Donnelly and Mike Braun (R) in preliminary results tonight. They account for 32 percent of voters – if it holds, a new high in available exit poll data. Donnelly ran evenly among men in 2012. Today they’re voting 42-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun. Suburban voters divide 48-49 percent, Donnelly-Braun. Donnelly won suburbanites by a scant 2 points in 2012; in 2016, fellow Democrat Evan Bayh lost suburbanites by 17 points and lost the race. Suburban women are voting 52-43 percent, compared with suburban men, 43-54 percent. Health care/immigration showdown: The vote is 74-22 percent Donnelly-Braun among those who picked health care as the top issue of four; that compares with 11-84 percent among the 26 percent who picked immigration as the top issue. Those who call Donnelly’s vote against Kavanaugh highly important divide by 41-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun. Libertarian Lucy Brenton has 4 percent of the vote, compared with 6 percent for Libertarian Andy Horning in 2012. Indiana Democrats ran ads highlighting Brenton’s policy positions during the campaign, seeking to draw conservative votes her way.    Donald Trump has a split-decision 49-49 percent job approval rating among Ohio voters today, in a state he won by 8 points in 2016. Those who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve by 7 points, 43-36 percent. Democrats were outnumbered by Republicans among Ohio voters by 3 points in 2016, 34-37 percent, and it’s the same gap again today, 35-38 percent. Conservatives accounted for a plurality of Ohio voters, 43 percent, in the 2014 gubernatorial race and 39 percent two years ago. Today, in data so far, they account for fewer voters, 37 percent. The national economy is well-rated – 73 percent in Ohio say it’s in excellent or good shape, up dramatically from 34 percent in 2016 – but far fewer say Trump’s trade policies have helped their local economy (30 percent) or say his tax law has helped their own finances (28 percent). Ohio voters pick health care as the top issue facing the country out of four choices offered; 41 percent choose it, far above the other choices. In a health-related issue – one that played prominently in the campaign – there’s vast concern about the government response to the opioid crisis – 28 percent approve, 61 percent disapprove.   Independents – often swing voters in this swing state – favored Trump over Hillary Clinton by 14 points in the presidential race two years ago. In the gubernatorial election today they’re splitting 55-41 percent, Cordray-DeWine. Women – who favored Clinton in Ohio by a scant 3 points in Ohio in 2016 - are backing Cordray by 58-41 percent over DeWine. Non-college white men, a GOP mainstay, are backing DeWine by a wide margin, 34-63 percent, Cordray-DeWine. DeWine is +5 points among Suburban voters, 47-52 percent, Cordray-DeWine (no longer "dividing evenly"). That includes a wide gender gap, suburban men 40-58 percent; suburban women 54-46 percent. SIZEPLC3, SEX In a race that focused heavily on the opioid crisis, voters who disapprove of the way the government is handling the issue favor Cordray by 57-39 percent. Union households, while historically a Democratic group, voted for Trump by 13 points in 2016, 54-41. Tonight, representing 26 percent of voters, they are voting 52-42 percent, Cordray-DeWine.    Democrat Joe Manchin is on track to win the West Virginia Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls. West Virginia voted 69-26 percent for Trump in 2016, his best state; today voters there give him a 63-34 percent job approval rating – his best approval rating in any of the 21 states where exit polls are being conducted. In terms of basic popularity: Joe Manchin’s (D) favorability rating is 49-47 percent. Patrick Morrisey’s (R) is a weaker 40-55 percent, 15 points under water. It could matter, since 25 percent say they’re looking chiefly for the candidate who “cares about people like me.” Democrats’ share of the West Virginia electorate has dived from 57 percent in 1996 to 32 percent now, a new low. Turnout by independents has grown – from 14 percent in 1996 to 31 percent today, a new high. Manchin won independents by 7 points in 2010, a key to his victory. Manchin was the only Democratic senator to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 40 percent of voters say Manchin’s vote was a key factor in their Senate vote. Twenty-two percent call it a minor factor; 34 percent, not a factor at all.   Among the state’s voters overall, 40 percent say Trump’s trade policies have helped their local economy (22 percent hurt, 33 percent no impact). Manchin slammed Morrisey for joining a lawsuit to repeal Obamacare and limit coverage for pre-existing conditions. Today 40 percent call health care the top issue (of four) in their vote, and voters divide 41-51 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect coverage for pre-existing conditions. Manchin won independents by 7 points in 2010. He’s running even with them, 47-47 percent, in today’s preliminary results. Among voters who call Manchin’s vote for Kavanaugh a factor in their vote today, Manchin leads Morrisey by 53-44 percent. There’s a wide gender gap, with a broad advantage for Morrisey among men, 40-57 percent, Manchin-Morrisey. Forty percent say they’re looking for the candidate who “shares my view of government,” the top candidate attribute, and Morrisey is winning them, 30-68 percent, Manchin-Morrisey. Moderates. Manchin got hammered among conservatives in 2010 but won political moderates by 39 points. He’s winning them by a narrower margin, 26 points (61-35 percent) in preliminary results tonight.  Forty-four percent of Florida voters say Andrew Gillum (D) is too liberal, while 37 percent say Ron DeSantis (R) is too conservative. Liberals account for 22 percent of voters, matching their high in governor’s races in the state. Many more, 39 percent, are conservatives. Donald Trump won Florida with 48 percent of the vote in 2017. He’s got a 51-48 percent approval rating now. Voters reject impeachment, which Gillum has supported, by 54-40 percent. Nonwhites account for 34 percent of voters in the state, including 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. That’s a new high for midterm elections in the state, albeit short of its 2016 record, 38 percent. While much attention often is paid to the Republican-leaning Cuban-American vote, 67 percent of Hispanic voters in this election are not Cuban. Rick Scott (R) won Florida’s suburban voters by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. Today they’re +6 Republican, 46-52 percent, Gillum-DeSantis, with a wide gender gap: 53-46 percent among suburban women, 39-61 percent among suburban men. Independents, who voted for Charlie Crist (D) by a 2-point margin in his narrow 2014 loss, are now +11 points Democratic, 54-43 percent, Gillum-DeSantis. They make up 30 percent of voters today, slightly below their share in 2014, 33 percent. Trump approvers overall are backing the president’s ally DeSantis, 8-90 percent, but among those who only “somewhat” approve of him, 14 percent of all voters, the vote is 28-65 percent, Gillum-DeSantis. Hispanics are backing Gillum by 58-39 percent, blacks by 86-14 percent, similar to their vote in 2014.  Minority voters may be key in Florida; they account for 34 percent of voters in the state in preliminary results, up sharply from a low of 15 percent in 1992 but less than the 38 percent who came out in 2016. That includes 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. Among Hispanics, 32 percent are of Cuban origin, while 24 percent are Puerto Rican, following an influx from the island post-Hurricane Maria. Forty percent say health care is the most important issue of the four asked, 29 percent immigration, 16 percent the economy and 11 percent gun policy. Voters give the Democrats an edge in trust to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, 48-38 percent. Sixty-seven percent of Florida voters call climate change a serious problem and say the government should do more to protect the environment alike, an issue used against both candidates after massive algae blooms. Rick Scott (R) has a 46-50 percent favorability rating among voters, compared with incumbent Bill Nelson’s (D) 50-43 percent favorability. Another consideration: Florida voters divide 50-46 percent on whether they’d like to see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate. On the Kavanaugh-effect front, 38 percent call Nelson’s vote against confirmation a top factor in their vote; 17 percent call it a minor factor – and 39 percent, not a factor at all. Battle of the ‘burbs? Nelson has won the populous Florida suburbs by double-digit margins in each of his past Senate races. Scott won them by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. It’s 46-52 percent, Nelson-Scott, in preliminary results tonight. That includes a 52-46 vote among suburban women, vs. 40-59 percent among suburban men. Scott’s win in the 2014 governor’s race came via a 21-point advantage among whites. Whites tonight are voting for Scott by 19 points, 40-59 percent. Those who think the government should do more to protect the environment are favoring Nelson by a 2-1 margin, 66-34 percent. Health care is the top-cited issue in the state, and it’s a 75-22 percent vote in for Nelson’s favor among those with cited it. Among immigration voters, on the other hand, it’s 17-83 percent, Nelson-Scott. Nelson’s margin among Hispanics improved from -6 to +22 in his past three elections – now it’s +15, with a 56-41 percent Nelson-Scott. Those who call Nelson’s anti-Kavanaugh vote a top factor divide 47-52 percent, Nelson-Scott.  Claire McCaskill’s (D) narrow first election in 2006 relied on her 6-point margin among women, as well as the fact that they accounted for 55 percent of voters in the state. Women make up 52 percent of Missouri voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight. Also to watch: conservative turnout. Conservatives accounted 37 percent of voters in 2006 when McCaskill first was elected and to 42 percent two years ago. They’re back down to 36 percent of voters in results so far tonight. Trump’s approval rating is an even 50-49 percent in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. Thirty-one percent say they’re voting to express support for Trump, 35 percent to oppose him. That said, in a threat for McCaskill, Missouri voters divide 45-50 percent on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans in control of the Senate. Forty-five percent think McCaskill’s positions on the issues are too liberal, while 42 percent think Josh Hawley’s (R) are too conservative. After two terms in office McCaskill has a 47-51 percent favorability rating; Hawley, 48-49 percent. While favorability doesn’t differentiate them, views on their ethics do: 50 percent say McCaskill has high ethical standards, while 39 percent say Hawley does. Health care dominates as the top issue of four offered – 48 percent call it the most important of four offered; the economy and immigration tie for second with 20 percent each. Missouri voters pick the Democrats over the Republicans to better protect health care for those with pre-existing conditions, 52-44 percent. Fifty-one percent of voters say McCaskill’s vote against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation was a top factor in their Senate vote. Seventeen percent say it was a minor factor; 27 percent, not a factor at all. Turnout among independents is 32 percent in preliminary exit poll results, potentially a new high in midterms, while Democrats and Republicans are at 34 percent of the electorate apiece. With Republican and Democrat voter turnout even, McCaskill likely needs independents to hold her seat. Independents are voting a close 49-47 percent, McCaskill-Hawley, in preliminary exit poll results. McCaskill won this typically swing group by 12- and 8-point margins in 2012 and 2006. Suburban voters backed McCaskill by 55-39 percent in her easy 2012 race against Todd Akin (R), but she lost them, 46-52 percent, in 2006. They’re voting by the same 46-52 percent in preliminary results today. That includes a gender gap, 49-50 percent among suburban women, 44-55 percent among suburban men. Those who call McCaskill’s vote against Kavanaugh a top factor are voting 46-52 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. At the same time, 83 percent call sexual harassment a serious problem; they’re breaking 58-42 percent in McCaskill’s favor. Unusually for a Democrat, McCaskill won 35 percent of evangelical white Christians six years ago, vs. 24 percent in her close first election. Today they’re dividing 27-72 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. Young voters (age under 30) account for 10 percent of voters in Missouri in preliminary results. They’re voting 63-34 percent for the Democrat – compared with 69-25 percent in her last race.    Republican Marsha Blackburn is on track to win the Tennessee Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls. Tennessee voters want the Senate controlled by the Republican Party, not the Democrats, by a broad 38-56 percent. It’s one of the top three states to favor Republican control (alongside Mississippi and North Dakota). Both Tennessee Senate candidates are relatively popular: Phil Bredesen (D) has a 51-43 percent favorability rating; Marsha Blackburn (R), 55-41 percent. Then there’s Donald Trump, with a 57-40 percent approval rating among Tennessee voters, considerably better than his 44-55 percent figure nationally. Trump visited Tennessee for Blackburn as recently as this past weekend. Could help her: 37 percent say they’re casting their vote to show support for Trump, vs. 27 percent voting to show opposition to Trump. Thirty-four percent say Trump’s not a factor. Bredesen, a former health care executive, has focused on health care; Blackburn on immigration policy. Among voters today, 38 percent call health care the top issue of four offered; 24 percent say it’s immigration, 23 percent the economy. Trump’s tough stance on immigration gets mixed reviews; 37 percent say it’s too tough, 31 percent about right - and 27 percent not tough enough. Thirty-eight percent of voters say Blackburn’s too conservative; 42 percent say Bredesen is too liberal. In terms of the candidate attributes they care about, someone who shares my view of government tops the list, 37 percent. Republicans account for 44 percent of voters so far today – more than either Democrats (26 percent) or independents (30 percent). Independents, potential swing voters in Tennessee, are voting 56-44 percent, Bredesen-Blackburn. Blackburn’s running competitively among women overall, with 52 percent support to Bredesen’s 48 percent. That includes a 41-59 percent result, Bredesen-Blackburn, among suburban women. Bredesen’s found votes in his focus on health care; among those who call it their top issue, he leads Blackburn by 72-28 percent. Then again, those calling immigration the top issue vote 18-82 percent, with Blackburn ahead, in preliminary results. Sixteen percent voted for the first time in a midterm election, voting 57-43 percent Bredesen-Blackburn.  If Mike Espy (D) gets into a runoff, his life won’t be easy: in a hypothetical head-to-head, voters divide 41-51 percent between Espy and incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith (R). Nonwhites account for 36 percent of voters in Mississippi, including 31 percent blacks. Black turnout is up by 8 points from its low of 23 percent in 1988, though off its peak of 35 percent in 2012. Conservatives typically dominate in Mississippi. In preliminary results today, they’re at 51 percent of the electorate, the most of any state with exit polls this election. Donald Trump is popular in MS, with a 61-38 percent approval rating, and 40 percent say they’re casting their ballot to show support for Trump. Both are among the highest of any state in the 21 where we have exit polls. With Hyde-Smith the only woman among the four most prominent candidates, voters by 75-24 percent say it's important that more women be elected to public office. Demonstrating racial divides, 65 percent of black voters in Mississippi say whites are favored over minorities in the United States today. Seventeen percent of white voters agree. In terms of top issues, 40 percent pick health care of four offered, 24 percent the economy, 23 percent immigration and 10 percent gun policy, similar to national results. Among those casting their ballots to show support for Trump, Hyde-Smith has 59 percent support, compared with Chris McDaniel’s (R) 36 percent. Trump endorsed Hyde-Smith. Women are dividing 46-34-17 percent for Espy, Hyde-Smith, and McDaniel. Among voters focused on health care, Espy leads Hyde-Smith 59-26 percent. Among those focused on the economy, it’s 30-56 percent, Espy-Hyde-Smith.    Bob Menedez is on track to win the New Jersey Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls. Bob Menendez’s (D) victory is largely thanks to the 55 percent of New Jerseyans who want to see control of the Senate flipped – highest among the 18 states where it was asked on exit polls tonight. Among this group, voters overwhelmingly chose Menendez over Bob Hugin (R), 93-6 percent. Additionally, among the 60 percent who disapprove of Trump’s job performance, Menendez beat Hugin by 83-14 percent. Menendez (D) is broadly unpopular, with a 33-63 percent favorability rating. Bob Hugin (R) is underwater in favorability as well, but not so broadly, 42-52 percent. Relatedly, just 27 percent say Menendez has high ethical standards. Twice as many say Hugin has high ethical standards, 45 percent. 33 percent of voters say neither has high ethical standards. Helpfully for Menendez, given those challenges, New Jersey voters say they want to see the Democrats win control of the Senate, 58-39 percent. Independents divide 59-36 percent on the question. Donald Trump has a 41-59 percent approval rating in the state, among his worst in the 21 states with exit polls tonight. Forty-seven percent say he should be impeached, more than the 41 percent who say the same nationally. Menendez lost whites by 10 points in 2012 but was elected on vast support from nonwhites. They accounted for a record 33 percent of voters then. Nonwhites make up 37 percent of voters in the state today, in preliminary results – a new high if it holds. Menendez benefits from representing a solid blue state; Democrats account for 43 percent of voters there in today’s preliminary results, Republicans just 26 percent. Hugin needs independents to swing it. They account for 31 percent of voters in preliminary data. Menendez is losing those who see him unfavorably by 35-62 percent. He’s also losing those who think he lacks high ethical standards, but he does win 44 percent of their votes nonetheless. Menendez ran evenly among independents in his first election in 2012. Today, independents are backing him over Hugin by 6 points, 51-45 percent, in preliminary exit poll results.  Arizona voters prefer Republican over Democratic control of the Senate, 53-42 percent on whether they’d like the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate, a potential boost to Martha McSally (R) vs. Kyrsten Sinema (D). Thirty-two percent in this border state cite immigration as the top issue of four facing the country, compared with 23 percent nationally. Still, more pick health care (41 percent) as most important. Donald Trump’s immigration policies are seen as “about right” by 41 percent, vs. too tough (35 percent) or not tough enough (17 percent). Nationally, his policies are seen as “about right” by fewer, 32 percent. Conservatives can predominate in this state, but their share of the electorate fluctuates – 41 percent two years ago, down from a high of 46 percent in 2010. Conservatives again account for 41 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight. Liberals – who turned out at a record 27 percent of voters in the state in 2016 – make up 22 percent in preliminary results today. Forty percent in the state say Sinema is too liberal, while 38 percent say McSally is too conservative. Trump has a 52-47 percent approval rating in the state, which he won by 4 points in 2016. Twenty-six percent say they’re voting to express support for Trump, 28 percent to express opposition, while 44 percent say he’s not a factor. For all the “referendum on Trump” angles, there’s another group to watch – the 44 percent of Arizona voters who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They’re breaking 42-58 percent, Sinema-McSally. McSally’s overwhelmingly is winning voters focused on the issue of immigration, 16-84 percent, Sinema-McSally. Those focused on health care, by comparison, are voting 77-22 percent. Independents account for 30 percent of Arizona voters so far tonight; in 2012 Jeff Flake (R) ran essentially evenly in this group (-1 point) to win this Senate seat. Today, independents are dividing evenly, 49-49 percent. Veterans – 14 percent of the electorate – go broadly for McSally, 37-61 percent, Sinema-McSally.  Donald Trump’s repeated visits to Montana came in a state where he has a 51-47 percent approval rating among today’s voters, higher than his 44 percent approval rating nationwide. Still just 26 percent say they’re voting to show support for Trump - and 19 percent to oppose him – leaving 54 percent saying the president, for all his visits, is not a factor. Voters are more apt to say they’d like to see the Republicans than the Democrats control the Senate, 50-42 percent. Incumbent Jon Tester (D) has a 49-48 percent favorability rating, compared with Matt Rosendale’s (R) weaker 41-53 percent. At the same time, 47 percent say Tester is too liberal, while 41 percent say Rosendale is too conservative. Independents predominated in Montana when Tester won his seat in 2012, accounting for 41 percent of voters. In today’s preliminary results they’re 45 percent of the electorate, maintaining their central importance in the outcome. (Republicans are 29 percent of voters; Democrats, 26 percent.) Forty-five percent say Tester’s vote against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation is an important factor in their vote; 53 percent of women say so, vs. 37 percent of men. Voters chiefly are looking for a candidate who “shares my view of government” – 57 percent say so, more than twice as many as say they care most about a candidate who “cares about people like me” – 24 percent. Forty-six percent of voters name health care as the top issues facing the country, among four choices. The economy and immigration trail (24 percent and 21 percent).  Forty-four percent call Jacky Rosen (D) too liberal; 39 percent call Incumbent Dean Heller (R) Heller too conservative. Fifty-seven percent call Heller’s vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh a top factor in their vote, about equal numbers of men and women alike. Heller is the only incumbent Republican senator running in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Voters today divide 49-51 percent on Trump’s job performance. While 34 percent say they’re voting to show support for Trump, 38 percent who are voting to oppose him. Voters divide 48-47 percent in these preliminary results on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate. Whites account for 62 percent of Nevada voters in preliminary results, nonwhites 38 percent – a record for nonwhites in midterms in the state. That includes 18 percent turnout by Latino voters – also, if it holds, a new midterm high. Twenty-three percent of voters are from union households, up 4 points from 2016. Today in preliminary results the electorate is 34-37 percent, Democrat-Republican. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 8 points in 2016 and by 9 points in 2012, when Heller won his seat.    Donald Trump and control of Congress are front and center in this election, and preliminary results from the state and national exit polls touch on both of them: In results so far, 44 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance, while 55 percent disapprove. And while the House races will be fought district by district, voters by 53-43 percent say they’d rather see the Democrats than the Republicans in control of the House after this election. (MORE: How to vote in the 2018 midterm elections) Antipathy toward Trump doesn’t reach majority support for impeachment – 41 percent of voters support impeaching the president and removing him from office, with 55 percent opposed. Still, 39 percent say they cast their ballots to show opposition to Trump, vs. 26 percent who say they voted to show him support. (33 percent say he didn’t figure in their vote.) There are vast divisions among groups on Trump and control of Congress, and voters recognize today’s political polarization. 77 percent say Americans are becoming more politically divided, while just 8 percent see greater unity. (13 percent see no change.) Indeed, even with the economy its best in decades by many measures, just 41 percent say the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent say it’s seriously off on the wrong track. There’s a huge gulf between Republicans and Democrats on the question, but among independents, often swing voters, 58 percent say wrong track vs. 39 percent right direction.   While preliminary exit poll results indicate a preference for Democratic control of the House, neither party is beloved. Voters divide 50-46 percent in favorable vs. unfavorable views of the Democratic Party. The GOP fares worse – 43-54 percent, favorable-unfavorable. Nancy Pelosi, a Republican bugaboo in the campaign, trails her party’s favorability rating - and Trump's approval rating - at 31-55 percent, favorable-unfavorable. In one more eye-opening preliminary result: 51 percent of voters today say the government has not done enough to protect this election from foreign interference. In terms of group sizes – which can change, these are preliminary results only: Party ID: Democrats account for 38 percent of voters in exit poll results so far, Republicans for 32 percent and independents for 30 percent. That compares with 36-37-27 percent in 2014, and 37-33-29 percent in 2016. Ideology: Liberal-moderate-conservative group sizes in results so far are 27-38-36 percent. That compares with 22-39-38 percent in the 2014 midterms. (And 26-38-36 percent in 2016.) Sex: Women account for 52 percent of voters in preliminary results, matching their previous high in a midterm from 2010. Race: Nonwhites account for 28 percent of voters nationally in preliminary results. The highest in any previous midterm was 25 percent in 2014. These compare with a low of 9 percent in 1990.    Among key issues in the campaign – beyond Trump himself – preliminary exit poll results indicate the following: Immigration: With the Central American caravan drawing broad attention in the campaign, voters divide on Trump’s immigration policies – 48 percent say they’re too tough, 32 percent say they’re about right and 16 percent say they’re not tough enough. Health care: Voters by 58-34 percent pick the Democratic Party over the Republicans as more likely to protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, another central focus of the 2018 campaign. Further, given a choice of four issues, 41 percent pick health care as the top issue facing the country, compared with 21 percent for the economy, 23 percent immigration and 11 percent gun policy. (We’ll look at vote preferences in each group as the night proceeds.) Kavanaugh: Any impact of the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may come down to state-to-state races. Nationally, the country divides – 43 percent support his confirmation, 48 percent oppose it in preliminary exit poll results.   Tax and trade: Two of the president’s signature economic policies get a mixed reception. Fewer than a third of voters, 28 percent, say they’ve been helped by the Trump tax law (45 percent no impact, 23 percent hurt by it.) And just 25 percent say Trump’s trade policies have helped their local economy. 31 percent say they’ve hurt, 36 percent say they've had no effect.   Women: As noted, women account for 52 percent of voters in preliminary results, matching their previous midterm high from 2010. And there’s a tremendous gender gap in views of president Trump’s work in office: While men voting today divide 50-49 percent on Trump, approve-disapprove, that goes to 39-60 percent among women voters. And while 57 percent of men approve of Kavanaugh’s confirmation, just 43 percent of women agree. Sharp gender differences extend elsewhere. Voters by 78-20 percent call it important to elect more women to public office; 53 percent of women call it “very” important, vs. do 37 percent of men. That may play out in the unusual number of races including female candidates this year.   And 84 percent of voters today call sexual harassment a serious problem in the United States, including 47 percent who call it very serious. 52 percent of women vs. 40 percent of men call sexual harassment a very serious problem. In an even bigger gap, 64 percent of Democrats call it very serious, vs. 40 percent of independents and 29 percent of Republicans.    Race: Turnout by racial and ethnic minorities is key to Democrats’ chances in many contests. Preliminary exit poll results can change, but in these early results nonwhites account for 28 percent of voters nationally; as noted, the highest in any midterm was 25 percent in 2014. That nonwhite total includes 11 percent blacks and 11 percent Hispanics. The previous highs in midterm elections were 13 percent for blacks, in 2014; and 8 percent for Hispanics, in 2006, 2012 and 2014 alike. With black candidates in several high-profile races, voters nationally by 71-24 percent say it’s important to elect more racial and ethnic minorities to public office; 44 percent say it’s very important. It’s very important to 61 percent of nonwhites, compared with 38 percent of whites. There’s also a sharp division – as much political as racial and ethnic – in whether voters think whites are favored over minorities, minorities are favored over whites, or no group is favored. Among Democrats, 71 percent think whites are favored over minorities. Among Republicans, just 10 percent agree. Voting: Ballot access is a related issue: In these preliminary results, the public by 54-36 percent sees voter suppression as a bigger concern than vote fraud. Age: Will young and first-time voters make a difference this year? Patterns of when people vote mean this can change, but in preliminary results 18- to 29-year-olds account for 13 percent of voters nationally today; it was 11 percent in 2014, when they backed Democrats for House by a 12-point margin. Economy: 68 percent of voters say the economy is in excellent or good condition, up dramatically from 36 percent just two years ago, albeit far below the peak, 85 percent, in 2000. Many fewer, though, say their own financial situation has improved in the past two years: 35 percent, compared with 30 percent two years ago. What typically matters most is people who say they’re worse off: 14 percent in today’s preliminary results. It was 26 percent in 2014; what mattered is that they favored Republicans for House – then voting against the president’s party – by 67-31 percent.   Mueller/Election Security: In the investigation still hanging over the Trump White House: Voters divide on Robert Mueller’s handling of his investigation, 42-46 percent, approve-disapprove. Voters by 53-43 percent say the Mueller investigation is mostly politically motivated rather than justified. Gun Ownership: 47 percent of voters live in gun-owning households in preliminary exit poll results. Stricter Gun Control Measures: 60-35 percent, support-oppose. Among those in gun-owning households, 42-52 percent. Veterans: 14 percent of voters, preliminarily. White Evangelical Christians: 27 percent of voters, preliminarily. The previous midterm peak was 27 percent in 2014. One of the most Republican groups, they voted 83-16 percent for House candidates in 2016, and 78-21 percent in 2014.   LGBT Voters: 6 percent of all voters in results so far, compared with 4 percent in the last two elections. Independents – often swing voters – are voting 55-41 percent for Democratic vs. Republican House candidates in preliminary exit poll results. In 2016, independents backed Donald Trump by 47-41 percent, and they voted Republican by a 14-point margin in the last midterms in 2014. Young voters (18-29) are voting 68-31 percent, Democratic-Republican. That vast 37-point margin compares with a 21-point margin for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a 12-point margin for Democratic House candidates among under-30s in 2014. In a continuing demographic trend, nonwhites make up 28 percent of voters today, the most on record for a midterm in exit polls since 1982.They’re voting Democratic by 77-22 percent, including 69-29 percent among Hispanics, the widest Democratic margin in midterms since 2006, and 90-9 percent among blacks. Suburban women were a focus of election coverage. They’re dividing 54-44 percent between Democratic and Republican House candidates. Among women overall, it’s 60-39 percent. Moderates backed Clinton by 13 points in 2016 and voted Democratic by a similar margin, 10 points, in 2014. Today moderates are voting 63-34 percent, Democratic-Republican, a 29-point margin in preliminary exit poll results. Twenty-seven percent of voters nationally are liberals - if it holds, a record high in any election in exit polls since 1976 (albeit by a single point from 2016). Conservative voters represent 35 percent of the electorate, compared with a midterm record of 42 percent in 2010. Republican candidates are overwhelmingly winning voters who say they’ve become better off financially under Trump’s presidency – but these are just 35 percent of voters. Among those whose financial situation is unchanged, the vote is 71-28 percent, Democratic-Republican. There’s been much attention paid to voters who say they’re either showing support for Trump or opposition to him. Also of interest – the 33 percent who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They’re dividing 46-51 percent, Democratic-Republican. Evangelical white Christians, a GOP mainstay, are voting 22-75 percent, Democratic-Republican, in the national House vote, their typical level. Clinton won college-educated white women by 10 points in 2016, and this group voted +2 points Republican in 2014. Now they’re favoring Democratic House candidates by 23 points, 61-38 percent. Across the political spectrum, non-college white men, 20 percent of voters, are going 34-65 percent, Democratic-Republican in their national House vote. That’s +31 points Republican, compared with their +46 points for Trump in 2016 and +35-point Republican vote in 2014. Voters who are focused on the economy are split 35-62 percent, Democratic-Republican. Among those concerned more with health care, that goes to a 77-21 percent Democratic advantage.

Rescue workers have begun to pull boys from that flooded cave. We'll have the latest from Thailand in just a moment. Also, courtside seat. President Trump prepares to announce his Supreme Court choice. DONALD TRUMP: If you turn in Monday at 9:00, I think you're going to be extremely happy. CHUCK TODD: Democrats hope to stick together in opposition and win over at least one Republican to defeat the nomination. SUSAN COLLINS: It would be very difficult for me to support a nominee who does not consider Roe v. Wade to be settled law. CHUCK TODD: It's a fight over the direction of the court for a generation or more. My guests this morning: Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Plus, North Korea nuclear talks. North Korea says the U.S. attitude is deeply regrettable and accuses the U.S. of a gangster-like demand for denuclearization. MIKE POMPEO: If those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster. Because there was a unanimous decision at the U.N. Security Council about what needs to be achieved. CHUCK TODD: Is this President Trump's "mission accomplished" moment? Also, the Russia investigation. Michael Cohen says his family and country have his first loyalty. And a Senate committee agrees that Russia tried to help Mr. Trump win the election. My guest this morning, President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Joining me for insight and analysis are Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute, NBC News Senior Political Editor Mark Murray, and Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief of U.S.A. Today. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press. ANNOUNCER: From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. CHUCK TODD: Good Sunday morning. We do have a lot to get to today. The troubled nuclear talks with North Korea. President Trump's upcoming NATO meeting. And that planned one-on-one with Vladimir Putin after the NATO summit. I have my interview with Mr. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the latest on the Russia investigation and the Michael Cohen developments. And of course, biggest of all, is President Trump's announcement tomorrow of his pick for the Supreme Court he’s doing that in primetime. But let’s begin with a story that has the entire world's attention, and right now it looks like it could be a good news ending at least. The effort underway right now to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach. They’re fighting weather. This is the big window that they have. Four have been rescued so far. Bill Neely is standing by right now in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Bill, what can you tell us? BILL NEELY: Yeah, good morning Chuck from a very rainy northern Thailand. Just a few minutes ago the third and fourth of those boys went past here in ambulances. So four of the 13, the 12 boys and their coach now in the hospital receiving medical treatment. They came down the jungle paths in ambulances. The first two just a few hours ago. And let me bring you right up to date because as we speak there is a news conference going on with the rescue commanders. First of all, confirming four children are now free and in the hospital. They say 90 divers in all took part in this operation. 50 international divers, 40 from Thailand, 10 were at the very apex of this operation. 10 went into the -- really it’s a ledge rather than a cave where the boys have been trapped for the last two weeks and one day. And the way it worked according to the rescue commander was that one diver put one boy literally underneath him as they went through the submerged sections of that cave. Remember even now, it’s possible that there are boys walking or waiting or even diving through this absolutely treacherous cave complex. So the divers put each of the boys actually beneath them. This has all happened faster than anyone expected. Three hours faster. He now says they have used all the oxygen tanks and they have to resupply those tanks. So this remains an ongoing operation with nine people still to be got out. And it is still a very perilous journey because they are going along what is potentially a death trap. Remember, just a few days ago a highly experienced Thai Navy diver died, collapsed and died. So still a very dangerous operation for these boys deep down. And the commander launched the operation saying ‘This is D-Day. It’s either now or never. There is no better time.’ Oxygen levels were falling inside that cave. As I said to you, rain is falling as well. There was a torrential downpour a couple of hours ago. So there was a red line for the commander beyond which they couldn’t pump the water out fast enough as this rainwater fell. So the operation is ongoing, the boys are being taken out two-by-two. We expect that this could be over certainly within 24 hours and four boys now being treated at the hospital. We don’t know what condition they’re in and which boys are alright. But an extraordinary operation going on as we speak, Chuck. CHUCK TODD: Alright, Bill Neely thanks very much. Now joining me is Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri. He's a member of course of the Republican leadership team. Senator Blunt, welcome back to Meet the Press. SEN. ROY BLUNT: Good to be with you. And good to hear that these boys are getting out of that cave. And hopefully today will be good news for all of them and their families. CHUCK TODD: Sometimes it's just nice to cover a good news story after all of that. All right. Let me begin actually in Asia and in North Korea and what happened there. Mike Pompeo was there this weekend. It seems like the meetings did not go well. I'm sure there are some people thinking, "I told you so when it comes to the North Koreans." You were skeptical. You were on here right before when the summit was announced. You were skeptical. The president tweeted, "We have nothing to worry about," within 24 hours of the summit. 26 days later, they're calling the Americans gangsters. SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, you know, Yogi Berra grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and it's déjà vu all over again. This is standard operating procedure for three generations now of dictators in North Korea. And I hope we at the end come to success. But I think nobody should be surprised by foot dragging. Nobody should be surprised by saying one thing and then apparently that's not what maybe they meant to say when they said it. This has, this has troubled now four U.S. presidents. And I hope President Trump and Secretary Pompeo are more successful than anybody's been up till now. CHUCK TODD: But I got to ask you, let me play here. This was the president within hours after meeting with Kim Jong-un. [BEGIN TAPE] DONALD TRUMP: We're going to de-nuke North Korea. It's going to start immediately. As soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe. I mean, he's de-nuking the whole place. And he's going to start very quickly. I think he's going to start now. They're getting rid of a missile testing site. They're doing so much now. So it's a process, and it's really moving rapidly. [END TAPE] CHUCK TODD: Is he naive? Is this is the naiveté of a first-term president? SEN. ROY BLUNT: You know, I think he's optimistic. I think he's genuinely optimistic about anything he is involved in at the time. At the same time, I think what you've got to look at here is actions. And as long as the actions are to continue to keep the economic pressure on North Korea, actions here will speak louder than words. And only those kinds of actions will ultimately bring North Korea to the place we'd like them to be. CHUCK TODD: Since the president gave-- we gave a lot to the North Koreans. International prestige, that moment. Is it time for the United States -- they threw a high, hard one at the United States by calling us gangsters. Is it time for the president to announce, "Okay, the military exercises with South Korea are back on"? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I thought it was a mistake to give the military exercises up. As you know when I was on here the last time, I said the one thing I wouldn't give up would be our presence certainly in South Korea. I'd hate to give up our ability to act interoperably with our South Korean allies. And the president, and the Secretary Mattis, Secretary Pompeo have to reconsider that I would think at some future time. Particularly if these negotiations appear to be going on for a long time. And that's what you'd have to expect from the North Koreans, is, again, foot dragging, standard operating procedure. Let's see how much world attention we can get and then at the end of the day how much economic assistance the North Koreans would be able to get. CHUCK TODD: Should the president stop the happy talk publicly? Is he his own worst enemy here? Overselling, underdelivering? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, again, I think what you've got to look at is actions as opposed to his optimism about coming up with a final solution. I hope the president sticks with the sanctions and continues to work with others in the neighborhood to maintain the sanctions as well. That means Japan. That means South Korea. That means China. CHUCK TODD: All right. The president has another tricky summit coming up with another authoritarian figure. This one by the name of Vladimir Putin. Are you nervous considering how the Kim Jong-un meeting went where the president gave a lot more than what was expected including getting rid of the military exercises? Are you concerned, for instance, he's going to hand Crimea to the Russians? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I would hope not. I would hope not. I think the Russian discussion about Crimea, about Ukraine generally, particularly the eastern part of Ukraine where clearly the Russians continue to have military forces there, what's happening in Syria and Iran. I think it's fine to talk to the Russians. But the president should clearly understand that neither the Russians nor dictators like Kim Jong-un are going to be charmed by anybody. They are very cold blooded, calculating. Putin would be in that category. CHUCK TODD: I was just going to say both Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin seem to have an idea of what they want out of these summits. Does President Trump know what he wants? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I think he's surrounded himself with a pretty good team. I think-- CHUCK TODD: Does he listen to them? SEN. ROY BLUNT: I hope so. Pompeo, Bolton, Mattis, all should--and General Kelly all are giving him the right kind of advice. I think he's comfortable with the team he's put around himself for the first time in his presidency. And hopefully that will show up in these talks. CHUCK TODD: I want to ask you about seven of your Republican colleagues went over to Russia. Six of them -- most of them were from the Appropriations Committee. No Democrat was with them. Why? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I think there's merit to talking. Senator Shelby led that-- CHUCK TODD: This looks like Russia's attempt though to get rid of sanctions. SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, hopefully it doesn't work in that way. And I don't think it'll work in that way. I think there's nothing wrong with talking to the Russians. There's nothing wrong with the president talking to Putin. There's nothing wrong with my colleagues talking to the Russians. CHUCK TODD: Right SEN. ROY BLUNT: But you just have to understand who you're talking to. These are people who run a dictatorial government. They're people who are exerting all the influence they can everywhere they can. And they don't have many resources, but they're making the most of-- CHUCK TODD: Were you invited to go on that trip and you declined? SEN. ROY BLUNT: I did not go on that trip, but I was going to be in Missouri for 4th of July parades and reopening the Arch. And had a lot of things already scheduled. CHUCK TODD: There's a report this morning that your leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is recommending to the president of his four finalists for the Supreme Court he believes that Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman would be easier confirmation fights than Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Barrett. And he's recommending that he would go in that direction. Where are you? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I'm looking to see who the president nominates, not trying to anticipate who that might be. I haven't talked to the president about this. Nor have I talked to Senator McConnell about it. But I think we can confirm any of the four names being mentioned. There are reasons to look in both the Pennsylvania and the Michigan nominee. CHUCK TODD: That's Kethledge and Hardiman. You lean more toward their-- SEN. ROY BLUNT: You know, I'm not sure I'm leaning anywhere on those four nominees. I think they'll all be -they’re good judges. I think they'd be fine justices of the Supreme Court. I think the president has to think about who is the easiest to get confirmed here. And I expect we'll do that on sort of a normal timetable of a couple of months. CHUCK TODD: Your colleague Lindsey Graham here last week said he believes Roe is essentially settled law. He believes in precedent, and he wants to see a nominee that also believes in precedent. Where are you on this? SEN. ROY BLUNT: Well, I think these judges, whichever one's nominated, should follow the Ginsburg strategy, which has been no hints, no foretelling of how they're going to determine-- CHUCK TODD: It’s the 21st century-- SEN. ROY BLUNT: --happens. CHUCK TODD: It's the 21st century. I think the American people should know. No? SEN. ROY BLUNT: You don't think the notorious R.B.G. standard is good enough? CHUCK TODD: This is the 21st century, where we expect everything. SEN. ROY BLUNT: No, I think we expect judges to judge the case that comes up before them. I'm not a lawyer. This is maybe a pretty good month not to be a lawyer. But precedent's important. But precedent's not the only thing. We have had bad precedents that were reversed after decades-- CHUCK TODD: That's not a nonstarter-- (OVERTALK) CHUCK TODD: --for you? SEN. ROY BLUNT: What is not a nonstarter? CHUCK TODD: The idea stare decisis. That if somebody doesn't believe in that, you're not-- SEN. ROY BLUNT: I think judges need to-- CHUCK TODD: That's not-- SEN. ROY BLUNT: --look at the case. The court needs to look at the case and determine that case on the facts of the case. CHUCK TODD: Senator Roy Blunt, I'm going to have to leave it there. But-- SEN. ROY BLUNT: Hey, good to be with you. CHUCK TODD:Thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Joining me now from the other side of the aisle and actually from the state next door in Chicago is Democratic whip, the number two in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois. Senator Durbin, welcome back to Meet the Press. SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Thanks, Chuck. CHUCK TODD:I've got the Illinois/Missouri rivalry right in front of me here. Let me start with the Supreme Court. Mitch McConnell has said he'd like to see it go in the direction of either Thomas Hardiman or Raymond Kethledge, believing that they would be less controversial perhaps than the other two. What's your-- what's your assessment of that, sir? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Before I get into that, hearts and prayers are with those boys in Thailand trapped in the cave. I hope our hearts and prayers are also with thousands of children, toddlers, and infants removed from their parents by the Trump administration under zero tolerance. They're trapped in a bureaucratic cave too, so let's not forget them. But to your question, all of these nominees have been pre-cleared by something called the Federalist Society. This is a group that looks carefully at each one of the nominees to make certain that they can check all the boxes when it comes to the most conservative political agenda in America. So whoever is nominated by the president, I was told by the White House they'll come off that list. Leonard Leo, the leader of this group, is the one who made the key decision. CHUCK TODD:So what is the Democratic party's strategy in the Senate? You have--you can do the math, you know you have 49 Democratic senators. First let me ask you this, is everybody going to be united? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:I can't say that until the president announces his nominee. Obviously each senator understands this is an historic decision. It'll decide the future of this court for a generation or more and so I know they'll look carefully at each nominee. I can't predict how all of my 49 -- or 48 colleagues in the Senate on the Democratic side will vote. I will tell you though, simple math tells you if John McCain is absent it's a 50/49 Senate. One Republican senator can decide the fate of any Supreme Court nominee. CHUCK TODD:In 2016--I'm going to play a quote of yours in September of 2016 about that -- the other Supreme Court vacancy that we were dealing with back then. Here's what you said. [BEGIN TAPE] SENATOR DICK DURBIN:In a few weeks the Supreme Court will start its new term with eight justices; we need nine. Major legal questions are hanging in limbo because the court is deadlocked on four/four votes. [END TAPE] CHUCK TODD:There's been some talk among some of your colleagues for Democrats to push for a delay until after the election. Obviously you didn't like that in 2016. Where are you on this? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Well, I asked Senator McConnell when Kennedy made his announcement whether he was going to be consistent. He said during the course of the vacancy at the end of the Obama presidency, "Let's wait and let the people decide in an election." Many of his colleagues came to the floor on the Republican side and said, "The people of this country are going to vote. They'll decide the future of the Supreme Court." Well, I asked Senator McConnell, "Are you going to use the same standard this go-around?" And obviously he is not. The net result of that, of course, is that we are going to move forward quickly to fill the vacancy. And I think it's pretty clear Senator McConnell was seizing the moment, stopping Obama from filling the vacancy with an extraordinarily qualified man-- CHUCK TODD:No, I understand that, but where are you on this now? Do you want it delayed? I understand you want to point out hypocrisy on McConnell's side. But there's hypocrisy on your side on this too, right? Do you think if it was wrong to delay in 2016, is it wrong to delay now? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Well, come on, Chuck. Get real. Senator McConnell invented this new rule and wouldn't even consider a meeting with Merrick Garland. And now he's saying-- CHUCK TODD:I take your point-- SENATOR DICK DURBIN:--we have to hurry through here and get this done before the election. Totally inconsistent. He's either wrong the first time or wrong the second time. The net result is he's trying to play to his political advantage. CHUCK TODD:What did you guys do wrong in the Merrick Garland situation? If you could redo it, how would you do it? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:I'm not sure we could've changed it. When it reached the point where the Senate Republican leader refused to even meet with the nominee of President Obama, a man extremely well-qualified, it was clear that the fix was in. They were going to keep this vacant in the hopes that they could put a Republican in the White House. It happened. And now Neil Gorsuch, chosen by the Federalist Society as well, has gone to the bench, is voting in lockstep on the Republican conservative side. And they want to fill this vacancy to give them an advantage in any future rulings. CHUCK TODD:I got to ask you though, now going backwards even before Garland, let's go to the Harry Reid decision back in 2013 when you decided to scrap it for everything but the Supreme Court, the filibuster. There were predictions this would be slippery slope, and here we go. In hindsight, mistake? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:I think at that time Harry Reid faced an impossible decision. They had announced -- The Republicans had announced they would not fill the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is a critical court, second only to the Supreme Court in its importance. They were facing all of these filibusters day after day, jurist after jurist, and Harry Reid made this decision. He did make an exception for the Supreme Court, which Mitch McConnell swept away. Chuck, let me tell you though, we look at this decision in general terms and talk about the process. CHUCK: Yeah/ But let's get down to the heart of it. This Supreme Court is going to decide whether or not people in families with pre-existing conditions can have access to affordable health insurance. That's it. It's real, and it's a constitutional challenge by the Trump administration this court will face. This court will decide the future of women's health care and the freedom of women to make choices about the future of their families. That is a critical decision this court will face. So beyond the procedure, beyond the gamesmanship, it is a life and death important decision to be made by this court on so many issues. CHUCK TODD:And yet you have this political dilemma that stares, I think, you and Chuck Schumer really in the face as the two leaders, which is this: staying united to stop the Supreme Court pick could cost you red state senators. Not fighting it as hard might allow the red state senators to get reelected and get Democrats in control of the Senate. That's your dilemma. SENATOR DICK DURBIN:It is a dilemma in one respect but not in another. I will tell you, the men and women that I work with on the Democratic side really take this seriously. They understand it's an historic decision. It's about more than the next election. It's about what country the United States of America is going to chart as its course in the future on this Supreme Court. I think each and every one of them take that seriously, that personally. It goes beyond the next election. CHUCK TODD:All right. And final question, you brought up the issue of trying to reunify these kids with their parents, the migrants at the border. A court -- the Trump administration is trying to buy more time. The court doesn't look like they're going to give them that more time. What's the recourse though? If a court says, you know, "No, you're not living up to this commitment," it's not like you can put HHS in jail or something. What is the actual recourse? SENATOR DICK DURBIN:I can tell you this: what we see in this process, forcibly removing children from their parents at the border and then putting them adrift on a bureaucratic sea where they can't even find them. If you take a child into a hospital for treatment the first thing they do is strap a bracelet on the wrist to make sure they aren't lost in the hospital. It is a convergence of cruelty and incompetence that brings us to this moment. And now it's up to a judge, a federal judge in San Diego to enforce his order this Tuesday so that children under the age of five are reunited-- CHUCK TODD:How do you enforce it? How do you enforce it if the administration's saying-- SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Well, if they-- CHUCK TODD:--"We only have so many resources?" SENATOR DICK DURBIN:I can tell you, they have the resources to get it done. Chuck, this is not an accident. This is a policy of deterrence to stop future flow, to be mean to these kids and their families to say to others, "Don't even try it." And that, to me, is cruel. It's not what America's all about. CHUCK TODD:Senator Dick Durbin, I have to leave it there. Democrat from Illinois. Senator, thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Much appreciated. SENATOR DICK DURBIN:Thanks. Good to be with you-- CHUCK TODD:By the way, NBC News will provide live coverage of President Trump's Supreme Court announcement tomorrow evening at 9:00 Eastern, 6:00 p.m. on the West Coast. Later on the broadcast we'll talk to President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. But up next, the fight over the Supreme Court and a reality check on North Korea. Panel is next so stick around. CHUCK TODD: Welcome back. Panelists here, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the Washington Post, Eugene Robinson. Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of U.S.A. Today. Danielle Pletka, the senior vice president at the American Enterprise Institute, and NBC News senior political editor Mark Murray. Of course, my partner every morning on First Read. Welcome, All. Let's start with Supreme Court. What we're learning this morning is that the Senate Republicans have a preference and they would prefer less of a fight. Raymond Kethledge, Thomas Hardiman, Susan Page, of the final four, those two are who Mitch McConnell prefers, essentially because Brett Kavanaugh is too much of a paper trail apparently and Amy Barrett would spark a culture war. That's essentially the message McConnell is sending. SUSAN PAGE: So here's what's amazing. Brett Kavanaugh's biggest problem is that he is associated with the last Republican president-- CHUCK TODD: Right. SUSAN PAGE: --right? With-- with George W. Bush. Who knew that would be such a liability with the next Republican president. And the argument for Amy Barrett is the same argument for and against, that she'd spark a culture war-- CHUCK TODD: Right. SUSAN PAGE: --because there are some Republicans who think that would be great and the question is will President Trump think that as well? She's 46 years old, that's an asset. You name her to the court and she gets confirmed, she could be there for four decades. CHUCK TODD: Eugene Robinson, there’s-- each one of these has a conservative concern about them-- sort of the... Susan mentioned with Brett Kavanaugh, it's the Bush connections. One administration official called him the low energy Jeb Bush pick. Raymond Kethledge Ann Coulter calls, I think, an open border zealot. EUGENE ROBINSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). CHUCK TODD: Amy Barrett, the culture war, the question is is that good or bad? You could have that discussion. And then the fear on Hardiman is that is he a Roberts or a Souter? So it seems like conservatives have a way of killing any of them here. EUGENE ROBINSON: So right. So what are they supposed to-- what are they looking for? I mean, some sort of, you know, ironclad guarantee that they.. in writing that we will uphold the entire conservative agenda, as you see it-- CHUCK TODD: Right. EUGENE ROBINSON: --by the way, not as other conservatives might see it. You know, I think if conservatives would take a breath and look at these candidates they'd see they're all really conservative as far as we know, as far as we can tell from anything they've written. I mean, there's nothing that I've seen pointed out in any of their writings that indicates they're closet liberals. Now, when judges get to the Supreme Court, guess what, they take their job seriously and they actually look at the cases and sometimes they don't decide in a way that their prior ideological leanings would indicate. CHUCK TODD: Mark Murray, Thomas Hardiman, I think, has an advantage over all of the others with President Trump for one reason. MARK MURRAY: Yeah. CHUCK TODD: Thomas Hardiman's relationship with the president's sister. Explain. MARK MURRAY: Yeah, those relationships do matter, particularly with President Trump. And, you know, the argument for also Thomas Hardiman is that he doesn't have that kind of paper trail. And to me, the biggest question about the Supreme Court pick is who ends up having the most pressure on them? Is it someone like Senator Susan Collins and Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski? Or is it the Joe Manchin, the Democratic West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana. And the Hardiman/Kethledge with not a big paper trail, they're more bland jurists, the pressure would probably be on the Manchins and the Donnellys. But all of a sudden, if you are talking about Amy Barrett, who has said some explicit-- CHUCK TODD: Right. MARK MURRAY: --things about abortion and on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, the pressure certainly then goes to Collins and Murkowski. CHUCK TODD: Danielle, it seems as if the president's got a chance to make. Does he want a win or a fight? That's what McConnell's presenting him, right? DANIELLE PLETKA: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. And the president, I suspect, doesn't really care whether it's a win or a fight, he wants somebody who he can sit down and have a beer with. Isn't that what the reporting said yesterday? But he's-- CHUCK TODD: Well, that's not Amy Barrett, apparently. Because we're told it didn't go well? DANIELLE PLETKA: I have no understanding of why it might not have gone well or what the president is asking each of these individual nominees, but I think you said the right thing. They're all conservatives, they're all qualified people. The fact that someone has a paper trail, to me, should not be disqualifying. You want people who are not afraid to make tough decisions, people are serious about their positions and about the rule of law. CHUCK TODD: Let's talk about what the Democrats are supposed to do here, Eugene. EUGENE ROBINSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). CHUCK TODD: You know, look, I guess the question is what kind of fight do they need to put up in order to make this a voting issue? EUGENE ROBINSON: Yeah, sure. CHUCK TODD: Because it seems as if it's never been a voting issue for the left the way it is for the right. EUGENE ROBINSON: Look, I don't know if the Supreme Court is ever going to be a voting issue for the left as it is for the right, unless and until Roe v. Wade is overturned and then it might be. Roe was really what sparked, I think, the conservative, not obsession, because it's real. But the conservative focus on-- CHUCK TODD: Yeah. EUGENE ROBINSON: --the Supreme Court and the fact that that is a voting issue for so many conservatives. And then sort of other issues sort of hang off of that. But I think Roe v. Wade is the central trunk of that tree. So I don't think it's going to get there unless something happens to Roe. I think they do need to fight because the base expects them to fight. I mean, even people who are now going to vote, they're excited, but they want to see a fight. CHUCK TODD: Yeah, they want somebody to climb up the Statue of Liberty. DANIELLE PLETKA: I think part of the problem here that the Democrats are kind of stuck in the last decade. They want this, they're trying to make this a priority, a fight about Roe v. Wade and about abortion. And that's not what this is going to be about at the end of the day. What's interesting to me is that the courts have become so important in the last few years because the Congress has stopped doing anything because the executive branch has so overreached, both under Obama and now Trump. People are going to say, "It surprises me that the Democrats don't want to get with the 21st century and recognize the power of the courts." SUSAN PAGE: You know, this is a good thing for republicans in the short term, this is going to help them with turnout. Either way they're going to have a big fight, Republicans and conservatives vote on the court. You might want to watch out what you wish for over the long-term. If you are credited with overturning with Roe v. Wade or with accepting a lot of new state restrictions on abortion rights-- CHUCK TODD: With five men, by the way, doing it. SUSAN PAGE: Yeah. CHUCK TODD: Especially if it's not Amy Barrett, right? Five men. SUSAN PAGE: You could pay a big cost with women voters, with millennials, who are pretty clear on where they stand on this issue. And over the long-term, this could be the seeds of real problems for the GOP going down the road. MARK MURRAY: But this all comes down to winning elections. And if the Republicans have been much better in recent elections than Democrats have been and you asked, you know, Senator Durbin, you know, "What was the biggest mistake that Democrats made with Merrick Garland?" The biggest mistake was getting routed in the 2014 midterm elections, which allowed Mitch McConnell to take over the Senate. And actually, if Democrats held on to a bare majority, you would have Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. And so being able to win in midterm elections and presidential elections, that's what gets you control of the court. CHUCK TODD: Well-- EUGENE ROBINSON: Yeah, exactly. SUSAN PAGE: Well said. CHUCK TODD: You guys. Okay, but what does Joe Donnelly do? Because of the base, he's the only one of these three that actually has a Democratic base to worry about. I think Manchin and Heitkamp don't. EUGENE ROBINSON: I'm very much in the Mark Murray in terms of winning elections being what Democrats need to do. They're out of power. They're out of the White House. CHUCK TODD: So that-- EUGENE ROBINSON: They're out of control of both of (UNINTEL PHRASE)-- CHUCK TODD: --so then the advice-- EUGENE ROBINSON: --they're out of state legislature-- CHUCK TODD: --so then-- EUGENE ROBINSON: --they need to win elections. So you let Joe Donnelly, vote how he has to vote. CHUCK TODD: There you go. EUGENE ROBINSON: Okay? (UNINTEL PHRASE) on Donnelly-- CHUCK TODD: So what you're saying is, if the choice is-- EUGENE ROBINSON: --you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you know, if she would vote her way, she can have her issues, let Joe Donnelly have his issues and let him vote his way. CHUCK TODD: I'm going to pause it there. We've got a lot of foreign policy to cover and I can't wait to hear what Danielle thinks about what happened in North Korea. We'll be back in a moment though with the Russia investigation and President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. CHUCK TODD: 09:34:44;07 Welcome back. There were two pretty big developments related to the Russian investigation that flew under the radar during this holiday week. The first was the official report from the Senate Intelligence Committee supporting the conclusion of three U.S. intelligence agencies that determined that Donald Trump was helped by the Russians in the 2016 election. 09:35:02;25 The other story was the apparent change of heart by President Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for the president, but this week he told ABC News, quote, "To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter, and my son and this country have my first loyalty." Well, joining me now is the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, welcome back to Meet The Press. CHUCK TODD: Joining me now is the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, welcome back to Meet the Press. RUDY GIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Chuck. CHUCK TODD: All right. RUDY GIULIANI: Happy to be with you. CHUCK TODD: All right. Well, you had said that the 4th of July was basically a deadline of sorts for you to determine whether or not you would recommend President Trump sit down with Robert Mueller. It is now past the 4th of July. Where do we stand? RUDY GIULIANI: Well, I think we're pretty much decided where we are. And we await the decision of the independent counsel. We would not recommend an interview for the president unless they can satisfy us that there’s some basis for this investigation. It's our, it’s our firm belief, and we think nothing contradicts this, that the president did nothing wrong. In all the leaking that's gone on there's been no leak of any fact that says the president conspired with anybody in Russia. I know from having been on the campaign there was no contact with Russians, no discussion with Russians. So we've got to see something. I mean, something started this investigation. What we're asking them for is: Is this the witch hunt that a lot of people think it is? Or is there a factual basis for this? You did that big, long counterintelligence investigation, which seems very, very questionable with very biased people who hated Trump and wanted to stop him. What did they find? Show us something. Mueller's been at it for 13, 14 months. 1.4 million documents. 29 witnesses. What did he find? Is there somebody who says there was a meeting where Trump discussed conspiracy to do this? There's nothing. CHUCK TODD: Well, but actually-- RUDY GIULIANI: Nothing. CHUCK TODD: --Mr. Mayor, in the public record-- and you and I have actually had a discussion about one of these, in the public record, we have the president admitting that he misled the New York Times on the Donald Trump Jr. statement when it came to his role in the infamous Trump Tower meeting of June of 2016. You said there's nothing -- this is a public record of the president contradicting, and I know it is not a crime for the president to lie to us in the media. However, how is that not itself probable cause for Mr. Mueller to want to question the president? RUDY GIULIANI: Well, because the fact is that also in the public record is the conclusion of that meeting. And that is that nothing was done about it. That the person came in under the guise of having information about, about Clinton but also to talk about adoptions. All she did was talk about adoptions -- CHUCK TODD: Wait a minute. RUDY GIULIANI: -- and sanctions. CHUCK TODD: First of all, we don't know that. That has not been fully-- RUDY GIULIANI: Well, we do know that because-- CHUCK TODD: --established. The story changed three times, Mr. Mayor. So if the story changed, how are we-- RUDY GIULIANI: No, no, no, no. CHUCK TODD: --so sure? Look, your own legal partner here in the president's team, Jay Sekulow, misled me. Now, you had said he didn't intentionally do that. I take your word. RUDY GIULIANI: He didn't. CHUCK TODD: I take your word at that. But somebody misled him then. Your client may have misled him. RUDY GIULIANI: They already have all these facts. They can do with them what they want. They don’t need – I, I can tell them that the president's testimony will be exactly the same as he said about this. CHUCK TODD: Which part? What he said in the public record or when he-- we don't know what he said-- RUDY GIULIANI: What he has said-- CHUCK TODD: --privately. RUDY GIULIANI: He has had an opportunity to think about it, to refresh his recollection. He's given a statement about it. And it's clear that there was no discussion with him about this and there were no - that nothing happened from it. CHUCK TODD: What's the president afraid of? He's not afraid to sit down-- RUDY GIULIANI: Not afraid of anything. CHUCK TODD: --with Kim Jong-un. He's not afraid of sitting down with Vladimir Putin. Why is he afraid to sit down with Robert Mueller? RUDY GIULIANI: One of the problems here, I think Jay and John Dowd would attest to this, is the president's very anxious to testify because he knows he's done nothing wrong. It's us, his lawyers, who have real, real hesitation about it. I mean, look at how biased the people who started this investigation were. I've never seen an investigation-- CHUCK TODD: Do you think Robert Mueller's-- (OVERTALK) CHUCK TODD: --a biased man? Do you think Robert Mueller's a biased man? RUDY GIULIANI: No, no. But I think he's surrounded by biased people, almost, almost exclusively. He's got a guy who donated over $30,000 to Hillary. He's got someone who was crying at her loss party, victory party, whatever you want to call it. And his lead investigator is probably going to go to jail. The F.B.I. agent who said, "You have to stop Trump." I mean, has there ever been an investigation of this magnitude with such obvious indications of extreme, disgusting bias which totally corrupts the process? Can I expect these people to be objective about Donald Trump-- CHUCK TODD: Then it sounds like-- RUDY GIULIANI: --when they have-- CHUCK TODD: Then it sounds like you think Robert Mueller's corrupt. I mean, when you're saying all that-- RUDY GIULIANI: I do not think he's corrupt. CHUCK TODD: Well, everything you're alleging. You're alleging then that he was willing to have-- you're making allegations that he was willing to have corrupt F.B.I. agents on his team. RUDY GIULIANI: No. No, no. That's a fact. He had a corrupt F.B.I. agent-- CHUCK TODD: He fired him. RUDY GIULIANI: --on his team. CHUCK TODD: And he fired him from-- RUDY GIULIANI: He put him on his team. CHUCK TODD: And he got rid of him. RUDY GIULIANI: Well, after other people found out about the-- he never bothered to vet him properly. And then he remains with a chief assistant and several very others very close to have him who have extraordinarily close ties to Hillary Clinton. And we've not looked at their texts. If we had not looked at the other guy's texts, we never would have known how much he hated Trump. But nobody's examined the texts of the people working for him. Maybe they should. But in any event, we're still willing to do it if in fact they can satisfy us that there’s a basis for this. And we think -- and John Dowd started this back in January. And since we started it, we don't get an answer, which I'm sorry, Chuck, as a lawyer makes me suspicious. Please be clear. President Trump wants to testify. We have to hold him back. And the only thing they’ve been able -- we've been able to do is it becomes easier as evidence of the corrupt nature of this investigation becomes clear. CHUCK TODD: Let me ask you two other questions. Are you concerned that Michael Cohen is going to start cooperating with the feds? RUDY GIULIANI: No. In fact, you know, if he wants to cooperate, I think it's great. We've been through all his records. I know Michael. There’s no -- he has no evidence of, nor was he involved in anything untoward with the president. The fact is that Michael has been a victim here like a lot of other people. CHUCK TODD: So you want, you want Michael Cohen to cooperate with the feds? You think that's a good development for the president if he does? RUDY GIULIANI: Yes. Because it's going to lead to nothing. And, look, Mueller gave it away. If this had any chance of leading to President Trump, don't you think Mueller would have kept this? I have every indication there's nothing in this investigation that has any ability to touch the president. And I think if Michael testifies or cooperates. I don't, I don’t know what's involved. But I'm hoping he'll be able to convince them that this was, this was not a wise investigation to start with. CHUCK TODD: The president's going to be sitting down with Vladimir Putin in just over a week. He's at the center of all of this. The Senate report just went out there. This is -- he’s been -- an influence campaign that was apparently approved personally by Vladimir Putin. As the president's lawyer, would you recommend your client sitting down with the person who's sort of at the center of this Russian investigation by Bob Mueller? RUDY GIULIANI: One thing as a lawyer, another thing as an American citizenand a person very interested in foreign policy and the safety of America and the world. He has to sit down with Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin happens to run one of the most powerful countries on Earth. Probably has the second or third-biggest nuclear arsenal. Has been very aggressive. On the other hand, has shown himself willing to negotiate. So I don't think he has a choice. I think it's a sign of how confident the president is that he did nothing wrong. He's not going to be stopped by this. I mean, this is the reason this investigation-- CHUCK TODD: You don't think he's hamstrung by the fact that if he, if he looks like he capitulates too much to Putin, that it only raises more suspicion? I mean, doesn't it put him in a box that either way he -- there isn't going to seem genuine? RUDY GIULIANI: As his lawyer, I would like to say yes because it's a good argument of executive privilege, that they're interfering with the president, the presidency. However, if you know Donald Trump, it's not going to stop him one bit. Any more than it'll stop him from doing any other thing. And he's ready to try to regularize things with Putin. But Putin's going to have to meet him more than halfway. CHUCK TODD: All right. Rudy Giuliani, I have to leave it there. RUDY GIULIANI: All right. Thank you, Chuck. CHUCK TODD: Thank you for coming on, sharing your views. Much appreciated, sir. RUDY GIULIANI: Thank you. CHUCK TODD: When we come back, our growing trade war with China. Who wins and who gets hurt? CHUCK TODD: Welcome back, Data Download time. President Trump has kicked his global trade war up a notch, targeting another 1,000 plus Chinese products this week. The economy has been strong under Mr. Trump, a booming stock market and low unemployment. But the impact of this trade war is going to start hitting American consumers in the coming months. And you may also know these folks by a different name, voters. Look around your home. A good 20%, one in five, of the furniture and household items you see has a "Made in China" label, according to a 2011 report from the San Francisco Fed. Now, go inside your closet. That number is closer to 36% when you add clothes. Remember, tariffs being slapped on Chinese goods by the administration will end up getting passed on to the consumer. The company doesn't pay it, we do. It's likely going to take a few months for consumers to start feeling this pain. But here's some of the specific Chinese products where you could see a price spike. Items like remote controls, batteries, tool sets, and USB drives have all been targeted, although it's unclear right now what that dollar increase will be. And remember, there are parts of other bigger products. Imported solar panels could go up between 500 and a thousand dollars per installation and the price tags for home appliances, like mini fridges and water coolers and thermostats are all predicted to go up by as much as 25%. Notably by the way, some consumer favorite items like flat screen TVs were taken off the tariff list after public outcry. But if this trade war lingers on, well, TVs could eventually be included in another round of tariffs on Chinese products. On top of all of this, President Trump is considering a 25% tariff on all foreign cars. And that would cost consumers an average of $5,800 per vehicle. The impact of these cost bumps would be much broader than China's targeted tariff on soybeans that we talked about a few weeks ago. And remember, President Trump's greatest strength has been the economy. According to a CNBC poll from just last month, President Trump's approval on the economy is 51%, that's a full ten points higher than his overall approval rating for his entire job, which sits at 41%. Now, to be fair, some American industries, like aluminum and steel, are expected to benefit from this trade war. But it's consumers right now, they're the ones paying the price. The problem for President Trump, as he continues to pursue this strategy, he risks damaging a strong economy in the short-term that has kept his poll numbers afloat. When we come back, End Game and President Trump's meeting next week with Vladimir Putin. Why that one on one has U.S. allies very concerned. CHUCK TODD: Back now with End Game. Okay, as I promised you Danielle, North Korea. Twenty six days later, the president told us we had nothing to worry about from nuc- from nuclear weapons from North Korea. There are a lot of people this morning thinking, "I told you so." DANIELLE PLETKA: Yes, well I think those people are right. The president came into office campaigning on the fact that the Obama administration signed an Iran deal that was the worst deal ever done, it was flawed, the Iranians were cheating. The president pulled out of that deal this year and now he is talking the way that Barack Obama did, even more liberally I would say, about North Korea without any facts to back him up. The problem here is very straightforward. The president says "denuclearize" and he means one thing and Kim Jong-un says "denuclearize" and he means another thing. CHUCK TODD: He thinks we should denuclearize if he does it--DANIELLE PLETKA: Thats--CHUCK TODD: Like--DANIELLE PLETKA: He meansCHUCK TODD: that's the point that's totally lost here, right? DANIELLE PLETKA: He means global zero. CHUCK TODD: Yes EUGENE ROBINSON: Of course. DANIELLE PLETKA: He does not mean, "I am going to take apart the plans that I am working on, the missile centers, the nuclear plants at (UNINTEL)." They have been expanding and working on those in the last week as Secretary Pompeo was winging his way over to Pyongyang. EUGENE ROBINSON: By the way, just to note, in the Iran deal Obama did get virtually all the fissile material removed from Iran, take it out of the country, as a matter of -- The bomb material. DANIELLE PLETKA: Well, they're still making the (UNINTEL) material. EUGENE ROBINSON: But it's gone. Whereas in North Korea, as you said, they continue with the development of their nuclear program and their missiles. You know, I-- I, this was never going to work. But they talked at least, that's something they hadn't done -SUSAN PAGE: But least -EUGENE ROBINSON: --in many years. I think that's probably a good thing. SUSAN PAGE: Least surprising headline in the world-- CHUCK TODD: Yes. DANIELLE PLETKA: --North Korea talks, not come to a meeting fruition. But you do see, I think, after a year and a half in office, President Trump's foreign policy coming to fruition. You see America first on trade, you see less concern about our traditional alliances with this NATO summit coming up. You see a much friendlier attitude toward Russia. This is a president who has definitely left his mark on the U.S. role in the world. CHUCK TODD: All right. But if, As George Will said, he called the North Korea summit a catastrophe, a disaster, I think. What do we think is going to happen with Vladimir Putin? Let me play President Trump's greatest hits when it comes to Putin. DONALD TRUMP: He's been a leader far more than our president has been a leader. It's better to get along with Russia than not. President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election. You know what, Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine with people. CHUCK TODD: NATO allies are already nervous about this meeting and they're already offended that the meeting got planned after the NATO summit, which is exactly the way Vladimir Putin would have wanted it. MARK MURRAY: Yeah, contrast that rhetoric about Russia and Vladimir Putin about the Trump rhetoric when it comes to NATO allies. You guys need to pay up, you guys are killing us on trade, et cetera, et cetera. And there is that kind of split and contrast there that does have a lot of people, very least, at pause. But to me, the biggest story with Trump going and meeting with Putin in Helsinki is Trump's continued denial about interference in the 2016 elections, despite the fact that other members of Trump's own team, like Mike Pompeo and other people from the national security community am saying, "Yes, Russia did, did meddle, they did meddle to benefit your campaign at the expense of Hillary Clinton's campaign," and the president still doesn't admit that. DANIELLE PLETKA: Right, but, but -- CHUCK TODD: Is he going to give them Crimea? Is he going to hand them Crimea? DANIELLE PLETKA: God, I hope the hell not. I really do. I, I -- this is a -- CHUCK TODD: But doesn't it look like they're setting that up? DANIELLE PLETKA: -- this is a, I don't know that they're setting that up. I don't think that there's anybody on the president's national security team who is going to recommend this. I think they're explicitly going to say to him, "Mr. President, you cannot be okay with this." You know, agree to disagree that time. CHUCK TODD: They're going to write, "Do not congratulate?" I mean -- EUGENE ROBINSON: Do not congratulate, exactly. Do not congratulate. DANIELLE PLETKA: Well, okay. But, first of all, let's be fair. One thing, we do expect more of our NATO allies than we expect of the Russians. It's important, it’s important to acknowledge that in fact our NATO allies don't spend enough on defense and that they deserve a lot of criticism for this. So I'm not going to disagree with the president on that, although I don't like his tone and I don't like the contrast. But the Crimea thing highlights something much more important, which is this awful meeting of sort of the Bernie bros and the Trump people on this question of eating away at other country's sovereignty. You know, "Oh no, that's fine, what do we care? Crimea, they've got a lot of Russians anyway." Bernie Sanders took that position, President Trump takes that position. I don't understand why it is that the center right and the center left are not more forceful on this issue. SUSAN PAGE: But Putin comes into this meeting having already succeeded, right? I mean, he has a situation where there's less pressure on Crimea and Syria, their behavior in both places. He has, he comes out of a NATO meeting that is a divided and a president who is friendlier to him than any U.S. president has been to a Russian since World War II. CHUCK TODD: And it's going to make for quite a week. Starts with the Supreme Court, ends with Putin. Unbelievable. Thank you all. Thank you guys for watching and we'll back next week. Because as we said, it's a busy week coming up. And if it's Sunday, it's Meet The Press. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we. We're taking another look at our software and practices to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.
