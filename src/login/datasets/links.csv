All market data delayed 20 minutes. First lady of the United States is a hard job. It’s not formally defined yet entails many demands; it has an impact on history but no formal powers; it’s the focus of all eyes, but people like to make it clear nobody elected you. It’s almost Thanksgiving, so we could give thanks that the election of more than a week ago is mostly over. Or perhaps we could thank the media that things are back to their new normal – journalists attacking President Trump around the clock. With Thanksgiving right around the corner, I must confess our cookbook has the best turkey recipe you’ll ever find. Ron Perlman. Alyssa Milano. Bradley Whitford...Georgia's really gonna miss you! Imagine putting a key international law enforcement agency in the hands of one of the top international law abusers. The shocking cover-up of the Democrats’ IT scandal in the U.S. House of Representatives just received a much-needed kick in the shin. Having experienced the profound influence of the sport first hand I’m offering a defense of this great game. There’s actually good reason to put a Christmas tree up in our house in mid-October, and it’s not to get a head start on decorating and celebrating. The demands that he do so are expressions of political theater with no factual or legal basis. This fall has been a record-breaking one for politics. Democrats have, in recent years, mostly sung from the same songbook. That is about to change. Don’t underestimate the lengths Trump will go to save himself. The First Amendment is a key to American liberty in glorious ways, but it is not an excuse for bad manners. Latest opinion cartoons from FoxNews.com Largely lost in the massive attention focused on the electoral results of 2018’s congressional voting, were the many ballot initiatives and state constitutional amendments on which votes were cast. With a heated campaign season behind us, it’s time for our leaders to come together, roll up their sleeves, and get something done for families across America. One man’s whim, or a counterintelligence scheme gone awry? Congressional Republicans need to pass bills quickly before Democrats gain majority control of the House. The holiday of Thanksgiving reminds us that we ought to be thankful for the blessings and the people in our lives.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/opinion/thanksgiving-family-argue-chat-bot.html---split---Advertisement By KARIN TAMERIUS NOV. 18, 2018   Thanksgiving is a beloved holiday because it’s a time to gather with relatives from afar. It’s a dreaded holiday for the same reason. Many of us aren’t accustomed to socializing with people who think differently from us, especially about politics. Our political attitudes and beliefs are intertwined with our most basic human needs – needs for safety, belonging, identity, self-esteem and purpose – and when they’re threatened, we’re biologically wired to respond as if we’re in physical peril. So how can you talk with people who disagree with you without setting off this fight-or-flight response? Drawing on extensive online dialogues with conservatives and my own background in psychiatry and political psychology, I developed a five-step method to help people have difficult conversations. Across the country, members of my nonprofit group, Smart Politics, are using this process to heal relationships damaged in the wake of the 2016 election. Many report being able to discuss politics with family members for the first time in years. Thanksgiving is the perfect time for you to give it a try. Before the big day, practice discussing a couple of difficult topics with Angry Uncle Bot, a chat program created to help teach you the techniques.   Not a good choice. This argumentative response will turn the conversation into a debate where you and Uncle Bot seek to score points and “win” rather than learn from each other or collaborate to elucidate the truth. In addition, the exclamation point suggests scorn and exasperation which will make the Uncle Bot angry. The goal is to have a conversation, not fight. Try this response instead: Not a good choice. This will turn the conversation into a debate over facts and figures. That’s a problem because people tend not be persuaded by contrary evidence and may even end up believing more strongly in their original position. Try this response instead: Good choice. The goal at this point is to start a conversation. The easiest way to do that is by asking questions – ones that are non-threatening, open-ended and non-leading. Questions are powerful because they make people feel safe, demonstrate respect, gather useful information, contribute to understanding, elicit empathy, build relationships and encourage self-reflection. Asking people about their own experiences in a nonjudgmental way is an especially good opening because it gives them an opportunity to talk about a subject they care and know more about: themselves.

Asking people about their own experiences in a nonjudgmental way is an especially good opening because it gives them an opportunity to talk about a subject they care and know more about: themselves. Not a good choice. Your frustration is understandable, but criticizing Uncle Bot for perseverating on the 2016 election will just make him mad. Plus, by mentioning Hillary Clinton (even to say she is irrelevant to the discussion), you are keeping her at the center of the conversation. Try this response instead: Good choice. Asking follow-up questions shows that you are listening to what the other person has to say. This makes them feel respected and heard. It also helps you gather additional information so you can better understand and respond to their perspective. Not a good choice. Not all questions are created equal. This question has the disadvantage of being close-ended, which is likely to shut down rather than open up discussion. In addition, it sounds like a “gotcha” setup that might put the Uncle Bot on the defensive, especially if his taxes didn’t go down. One of the goals of asking questions is to make people feel safe. Try this response instead: Good choice. Asking follow-up questions shows that you are listening to what the other person has to say. This makes them feel respected and heard. It also helps you gather additional information so you can better understand and respond to their perspective. Good choice. After Uncle Bot shares his point of view, it’s important to check and show your understanding by reflecting what you heard. Good reflections paraphrase what the other person said and highlight emotions. Truly exceptional reflections are met with, “Exactly! I couldn’t have said it better myself.” Not a good choice. Smugly highlighting inconsistencies in Uncle Bot’s statements will make him angry and defensive, which will reduce his capacity for rationality, open-mindedness and empathy. If you want someone to hear what you have to say, you first need to make him feel safe. Try this response instead: Not a good choice. In general, talking about specific political figures gets in the way of productive dialogue. People tend to have very strong opinions about elected officials like Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that increase reactivity and reduce rationality. In this conversation, your goal should be to move away from talking about the president. Try this response instead: Good choice. After Uncle Bot shares his point of view, it’s important to check and show your understanding by reflecting what you heard. Good reflections paraphrase what the other person said and highlight emotions. Truly exceptional reflections are met with, “Exactly! I couldn’t have said it better myself.” Not a good choice. Although this statement may come from a place of genuine concern for the well-being of Uncle Bot, he will probably be insulted by the suggestion that he needs “help,” especially from the government. Try this response instead: Not a good choice. “I told you so” responses threaten Uncle Bot’s self-esteem and will turn this conversation into a fight. Plus, talking about the past will lead to relitigation of the 2016 election or tirades about Benghazi and missing email. Try this response instead: Good choice. After you’ve shown Uncle Bot that you understand and have heard his point of view, it’s important to highlight areas where you agree. Agreement serves to eliminate residual defensiveness and demonstrates that the two of you are allies in the struggle to improve the economy. In general, it is easiest to agree about goals, values and emotions. Good choice.

Try this response instead: Good choice. After you’ve expressed your areas of agreement with Uncle Bot, it’s time for you to share your perspective. The key to sharing persuasively is to present a story rather than an argument. In the words of Jonathan Haidt, “The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor.” Stories are powerful because they capture attention, transmit information, provoke strong emotions, elicit empathy and improve recall.

In the words of Jonathan Haidt, “The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor.” Stories are powerful because they capture attention, effectively transmit information, provoke strong emotions, elicit empathy and improve recall. As you converse with the Angry Uncle Bot, you’ll notice a pattern. A handful of responses move the interaction forward while others make it halt or careen. Successful responses are part of a five-step process that makes conversations with the Angry Uncle Bot (and real angry uncles) less polarized and more productive. Ask Listen Reflect Agree Share Reflect Ask Listen Share Agree 1. Ask open-ended, genuinely curious, nonjudgmental questions. 2. Listen to what people you disagree with say and deepen your understanding with follow-up inquiries. 3. Reflect back their perspective by summarizing their answers and noting underlying emotions. 4. Agree before disagreeing by naming ways in which you agree with their point of view. 5. Share your perspective by telling a story about a personal experience. At the heart of the method is a simple idea: People cannot communicate effectively about politics when they feel threatened. Direct attacks – whether in the form of logical argument, evidence, or name-calling – trigger the sympathetic nervous system, limiting our capacity for reason, empathy, and self-reflection. To have productive conversations, we first need to make people feel safe. Most political conversations founder because challenges to our beliefs trigger our sympathetic nervous system. The goal is ensuring people feel safe enough during political dialogues to avoid this. That way the rational part of their brains stays in control and they’re better able to hear, absorb and adapt to new information. While it’s a powerful approach, it isn’t easy. It takes patience, tolerance and conscious engagement to get through all five steps. The method puts the burden for keeping the conversation calm on you: Not only must you not trigger the other person, but you must not get triggered yourself. Given the challenge, it’s tempting to avoid political discussions in mixed company altogether. Why risk provoking your angry uncle when you can chat about pumpkin pie instead? The answer is that when we choose avoidance over engagement, we are sacrificing a critical opportunity and responsibility to facilitate social and political change. Throughout American history, important strides were made because people dared to share their political views with relatives. The civil rights movement, the women’s movement, the antiwar movement, the gay rights movement, the struggle for marriage equality – all gained acceptance through difficult conversations among family members who initially disagreed vehemently with one another. To improve political discourse, remember your goal isn’t to score points, vent or put people in their place; it’s to make a difference. And that means sharing your message in a way that people who disagree with you – including your angry uncle – can hear. Dr. Karin Tamerius is the founder and managing director of Smart Politics, a nonprofit organization that teaches progressives how to communicate more effectively across partisan divides.

Another complication: potential trials for #2020census #citizenshipquestion lawsuits are set to start on Jan. 7 in San Francisco and on Jan. 22 in Greenbelt, Md. They are *potential* bc judges haven't ruled yet on Trump admin's requests to skip trials. Hearings in December. 6. Judge Furman has said repeatedly he wants to move the cases before him along as quickly as possible. He's anticipating appeals. With #SCOTUS setting oral arguments over Ross' depo & other evidence issues for Feb. 19, the timeline here gets complicated. 5.

Some context to keep in mind: The issue before the U.S. Supreme Court right now is not about whether the new #citizenshipquestion the Trump admin added should be removed from the #2020census.

---split---2.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/threat-pelosi-16-dems-back-leadership-59297501---split---Sixteen Democrats who've opposed Nancy Pelosi's quest to become speaker released a letter Monday saying they will vote for "new leadership" when the House picks its leaders in January, underscoring a significant threat to her effort to lead her party's House majority in the next Congress. The letter's release suggests that rather than spending the next six weeks focusing on a fresh agenda to present to Americans, House Democrats could be consumed with a bitter and attention-grabbing internal leadership fight. The battle pits the party's largely liberal and diverse membership backing Pelosi, D-Calif., against a small group of mostly moderate male lawmakers. Of the 16 Democrats who signed the letter — which stops short of explicitly saying they will vote for an opposing candidate for speaker — all but two are men: Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and California's Linda Sanchez. "We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise," the authors wrote, referring to campaign pledges by a number of Democratic candidates. "Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House Floor." Pelosi has activated an aggressive campaign for the job involving House colleagues, prominent outside Democrats and party-aligned interest groups. Her office distributed endorsements Monday from nine House Democrats who are military veterans and UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights organization. Known as a precise vote counter with a keen sense of her caucus' leanings, Pelosi is aided by the lack of a declared opponent and many weeks during which she can dangle choice committee assignments, rules changes and other goodies to help attract support. "Leader Pelosi remains confident in her support among Members and Members-elect," spokesman Drew Hammill said in a written statement. He said 94 percent of House Democrats declined to sign the letter, though Pelosi opponents said they expect others who didn't sign to vote against her. Though the mavericks' numbers represent a handful of the 232 House Democrats elected, plus five races still undecided, they could still garner enough opposition to thwart her. Pelosi seems certain to have enough support to become her party's nominee for speaker when House Democrats vote by secret ballot on Nov. 28. She will need only a majority of Democrats in that contest. But when the full House elects its new leaders Jan. 3, the speaker will need a majority 218 votes, assuming that no one votes "present" or misses the vote and Republicans oppose her en masse, as seems likely. At 232 seats, Pelosi could afford to lose just 14 Democrats and still become speaker. The rebels' letter to their Democratic colleagues praises Pelosi, 78, as "a historic figure" who helped win major victories. Pelosi was speaker from 2007 through 2010 when Democrats held the majority and has been the party's leader since 2003. "We also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change," they wrote. "Our majority came on the backs of candidates who said that they would support new leadership because voters in hard-won districts, and across the country, want to see real change in Washington." Pelosi's critics say the party's long-serving top leaders must make room for younger members. They say years of Republican ads portraying her as an out-of-touch liberal have made it hard for moderate Democrats to win in swing districts. Pelosi allies counter that the party just won House control with their biggest gain of seats since the 1974 post-Watergate election. Many bristle at dumping her at a time when President Donald Trump and the #MeToo movement have helped attract female candidates and voters to the party. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland has been No. 2 House Democrat since 2003 and South Carolina's Jim Clyburn has been No. 3 since 2007. Both are in their late 70s and are running, unopposed so far, for those posts again. Of the letter's signees, five are incoming House freshmen or hope to be. Two of them — Anthony Brindisi of New York and Ben McAdams of Utah — are in races in which The Associated Press has yet to call a winner. Pelosi critics assert there are more Democrats who've not signed the letter who are prepared to vote against Pelosi. That includes Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, who's said she's considering running for speaker. Trump has tweeted his respect for Pelosi and offered to round up GOP votes to help elect her speaker. Pelosi's office has said she will win with Democratic votes, and it seems a stretch to expect Republicans to help elect her speaker — a vote that could open them up to primary challenges in 2020. Others signing were incumbents Jim Cooper of Tennessee; Bill Foster of Illinois; Brian Higgins of New York; Stephen Lynch and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; Ed Perlmutter of Colorado; Tim Ryan of Ohio; Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Filemon Vela of Texas. Incoming freshmen were Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Max Rose from New York and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.
---split---2.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/saudi-kings-speech-makes-mention-slain-journalist-59289309---split---Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday gave his first major speech since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, expressing support for his son, the crown prince, and making no mention of allegations that the young royal ordered the killing. The annual policy speech by the king instead highlighted Saudi Arabia's priorities for the coming year, focusing on issues such as the war in Yemen, security for Palestinians, stability in the oil market, countering rival Iran and job creation for Saudis. The king voiced support for his favored son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that the 32-year-old heir to the throne is focused on developing the capabilities of Saudi youth. The prince oversees all major levers of power in the kingdom, ranging from security to the economy. "The country is working tirelessly to create more jobs and training for Saudi youth," Salman said. "The crown prince, chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs and Development, has focused on developing human capabilities and preparing the new generation for future jobs." Saudi media reported Monday that the crown prince will attend the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month. It would be the first trip abroad for the crown prince after the Oct. 2 slaying of Khashoggi, and would bring him face to face with world leaders from the U.S., Turkey, Canada and European countries that have strongly criticized the kingdom for the brutal killing. King Salman delivered his remarks in the ornate hall of the consultative Shura Council before the country's ministers, senior officials, military officers and clerics. Prince Mohammed was in attendance and seated next to the country's top cleric. In the wake of Khashoggi's killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the 82-year-old monarch put Prince Mohammed in charge of overseeing the reorganization of intelligence services. The king's speech made no reference to that, but he did commend Saudi Arabia's judiciary and public prosecution for their work in seeking justice in accordance with Islamic law. He said the kingdom "takes pride in the blessed efforts" of the judiciary and public prosecution, adding that Saudi Arabia affirms its commitment to the application of Islamic law. On Thursday, Saudi prosecutors said they are seeking the death penalty against five men suspected of killing Khashoggi, who had written critically of the crown prince in columns for The Washington Post. The prosecutor's announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi's death and distance the killers and their operation from the crown prince. U.S. intelligence officials, however, have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. Others familiar with the case caution that while it's likely that the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played. Saudi investigators say a high-ranking adviser to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani, and a senior intelligence official, Ahmed al-Assiri, concocted a plan to force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia, deeming his presence abroad as a threat to national security. Saudi prosecutors say the 15-man team sent to Istanbul exceeded their authority when the lead negotiator in the team decided to kill Khashoggi for refusing orders to return. The Saudis say the agents killed Khashoggi with tranquilizers and then dismembered his body, which has not been found. Those findings came after Saudi authorities spent weeks denying Khashoggi had been killed in the embassy. This past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on their conclusions, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those sanctioned was al-Qahtani, who was fired from his post as the crown prince's adviser after details of the killing emerged. President Donald Trump has said his administration will get "a very full report," including who was responsible for Khashoggi's death, on Monday or Tuesday. Trump has criticized the Saudi response to the killing, but has been reluctant to say definitively if he thinks the crown prince ordered it. ——— Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

---split---2.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/tijuana-residents-protest-migrant-caravan-camped-city-59279696---split---Hundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S. Tensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road, and with many more months ahead of them while they seek asylum. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived. On Sunday, displeased Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted "Out! Out!" in front of a statue of the Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the U.S. border. They accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an "invasion." And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group. "We don't want them in Tijuana," protesters shouted. Juana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records. A woman who gave her name as Paloma lambasted the migrants, who she said came to Mexico in search of handouts. "Let their government take care of them," she told video reporters covering the protest. A block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don't represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: Childhood has no borders. Most of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats. But the journey has been hard, and many have turned around. Alden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. "We want them to return to Honduras," said Rivera. Honduras has a murder rate of 43 per 100,000 residents, similar to U.S. cities like New Orleans and Detroit. In addition to violence, migrants in the caravan have mentioned poor economic prospects as a motivator for their departures. Per capita income hovers around $120 a month in Honduras, where the World Bank says two out of three people live in poverty. The migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx. While many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants' plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at them. The cold reception contrasts sharply with the warmth that accompanied the migrants in southern Mexico, where residents of small towns greeted them with hot food, campsites and even live music. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an "avalanche" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx. Mexico's Interior Ministry said Saturday that the federal government was flying in food and blankets for the migrants in Tijuana. Tijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000. At the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. "We are fleeing violence," said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. "How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?" Some from the caravan have diverted to other border cities, such as Mexicali, a few hours to the east of Tijuana. Elsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S. Edwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer. U.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S. Trump wrote that like Tijuana, "the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!" He followed that tweet by writing: "Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away." ——— Guthrie reported from Mexico City. Associated Press writer Julie Watson contributed to this story from Tijuana and Marcos Aleman contributed from San Salvador.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/japans-top-cybersecurity-official-has-never-used-a-computer/---split---The US refused to join a new global cybersecurity agreement this week—maybe because it was created by French president Emmanuel Macron, with whom President Trump isn’t on great terms. On the same day, internet traffic that was supposed to route through Google’s cloud servers instead went haywire, traveling through unplanned servers based in the likes of Russia and China. Hack? No, as Lily Hay Newman explains, though the cause was still worrisome. We also brought you the lowdown on how Darpa is preparing a Hail Mary plan to restart an electric grid in the case of a major infrastructure hack. We showed you how to get rid of old electronics without leaving your personal data on them. We explained what a bot really even is. And, with Mozilla’s help, we explained how to shop for cyber-secure toys for the holidays. Cryptographer Bruce Schneier explained why surveillance kills freedom and experimentation. And Garrett Graff laid out why the Mueller investigation is probably going to be just fine—despite Trump firing Jeff Sessions and replacing him with a person who called the investigation a witch hunt. And there's more! As always, we’ve rounded up all the news we didn’t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The most cybersecure devices are the ones that aren’t connected to the internet at all. Japan’s minister of cybersecurity Yoshitaka Sakurada appears to have taken that advice a little far, admitting in front of Japanese parliament this week that he has actually never used a computer. At all. The nation of Japan was understandably aghast. When asked whether nuclear power plants in the country allowed USB drives to be used on their computers, Sakurada admitted he didn’t know what a USB drive was. He told parliament if they need to have better answers they should bring in an expert. Though the story is funny in a “this is fine” meme kind of way, it’s actually terrifying, and exemplifies a growing trend of nonexperts in governing positions—and not just in Japan. American lawmakers are increasingly without expertise in the areas they’re assigned to oversee. After the midterms, it made headlines that a lawmaker with an actual science background would be leading the House science committee. It was news because it was such a rarity. This isn’t really fine, is it? It happened in 2016. And now it’s happened again. A judge in New Hampshire has said that Amazon’s Alexa may have heard the stabbing murder of two women. The judge ruled this week that Amazon should hand over the records to prosecutors in the case against the man accused. Amazon said it will only deliver the recordings with a binding legal order, which it appeared to deny the ruling constituted. In an apparent error, a US assistant attorney revealed in an unrelated court filing that Julian Assange has been charged “under seal” in the US. That means no details of the charge, or even the charge itself, are meant to be known by the public. The unrelated filing stated: “Due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.” It went on to indicate the US plans to arrest Assange, who is reportedly wearing out his welcome at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he’s been hiding for the past six years. A spokesman for the court told The Washington Post, “The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.” The Post suggests the filing might relate to the Mueller probe, which has been investigating the role Wikileaks played in Russia’s misinformation attack on the US presidential election in 2016. Facebook says that US government requests for user data have gone up by 30 percent year over year. Most of these were court-ordered search warrants, which the company prevented from alerting users about. The figures were released in its latest transparency report, which came out a day after The New York Times bombshell investigation into the company’s mishandling of Russian misinformation on the platform during the presidential election. Facebook’s transparency report also reveals that between 2014 and 2017, Facebook reports the US government served it with 13 national security letters, the secret subpoenas the FBI issues to companies for data without any judicial oversight, and about which companies are often prevented from discussing publicly. Facebook disclosed the information after the government lifted the gag orders on these specific NSLs earlier this year, according to Facebook’s deputy general counsel Chris Sonderby. As if its traffic being rerouted erroneously through Russia and China wasn’t bad enough, Google’s official G Suite Twitter account was also hacked this week. In a since-deleted tweet, the account promoted a bitcoin scam to its more than 800,000 followers. The Next Web reports the hack was part of a string Bitcoin related scams going around. Earlier that same day Target’s Twitter account had done the same thing. In good news, internet security company Cloudflare released a mobile version of its 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, which works to protect your browsing privacy while on a public internet connection by hiding your IP address.

I spent weeks figuring out how hate gurgles up from the nastiest recesses of the Internet. And I’m sorry to report that unconscionable racists will be a force in American politics well beyond November 8. The gun debate would change in an instant if Americans witnessed the horrors that trauma surgeons confront everyday. With one miscalculation, by one startled pilot, at 400 miles an hour. And now that Russia is determined to destabilize the West, this scenario is keeping the military establishment up at night. When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there’s a fuse. “Sexual harassment” wasn’t even a term until 1975. Why some women in national parks and forests have a tougher time than women in the military. How an unassuming bureaucrat outsmarted Jamie Oliver and pulled off an honest-to-god miracle in one of America’s unhealthiest cities. Inside the NFL's relentless, existential, Big Tobacco-style pursuit of your children. One of the greatest enigmas of 2016, explained. And since then, at least 810 people have lost their lives in jail. Over the course of 20 years, Johnson & Johnson created a powerful drug, promoted it illegally to children and the elderly, covered up the side effects and made billions of dollars. This is the inside story. These three campaign gurus for Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have had some time to reflect on this nightmare of a campaign. And do they ever have stories to tell. Several decades ago, 229 men and one woman were convicted of terrible crimes. They thought they were going to die in prison. But then, many years later, in a nerve-wracking experiment, they received an unimagined second chance. How the military is preparing for the possibility of a wild card in the Situation Room. Inside the pharmaceutical industry’s campaign to put us all to sleep. We’re still trying to eliminate sweatshops and child labor by buying right. But that’s not how the world works in 2015. It’s complicated. Seven crucial days on the campaign trail. Six months ago, the worst thing that ever happened to me was the biggest news on the internet. Now… Scientists believe they’ve discovered a simple formula for happy relationships. Reader, I tried it. And then they upload the photos to social media. A journey to an island caught between the ancient world and 2015. Thousands of rape victims around the world undergo grisly and unsafe abortions because of U.S. policy. Obama could change this with a single executive action. Why hasn’t he? The worst relationship between a U.S. President and an Israeli Prime Minister ever ... as autopsied by the people closest to them. The first female chief of the IMF on the Greek meltdown, a historic refugee crisis and one thing Hillary Clinton has in common with an “old crocodile.” Yousef Al-Otaiba is the most charming man in Washington: He’s slick, he’s savvy and he throws one hell of a party. And if he has his way, our Middle East policy is going to get a lot more aggressive. Their children abandoned them to join the worst terror organization on earth. Now all they have is each other. There’s a miraculous new treatment for schizophrenia that could transform the way we treat mental illness. And then there are the terrible reasons why most medical professionals have never heard of it. Home to one of the most brazen, deadly corporate gambits in U.S. history. One famous band. One huge secret. Many lives destroyed. A documentary that disappeared more than 40 years ago—available to everyone for the first time here—is a gift to modern-day feminists. It’s belligerent, it’s hilarious, and it reveals exactly what the Clinton campaign is missing. What the future of low-wage work really looks like. Let us explain.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/us/landowners-in-rio-grande-valley-sound-off-on-border-wall---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Residents along Rio Grande Valley have mixed reactions to plan MISSION, Texas – Marianna Trevino-Wright, executive director of the National Butterfly Center, is preparing for the inevitable. The 100-acre nature preserve on the U.S.-Mexico border sits in the path of a border wall that will soon be built. In more than three months, government contractors will begin work on the levee road that divides the property. “They will be clearing all the trees and vegetation from this area to create their enforcement zone. They’re going to excavate the earth and levee, put in an 18-foot vertical concrete slab wall, and on top of that 18-foot steel bollards,” said Trevino-Wright. In the last two weeks, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, announced the construction of two additional border walls in Hidalgo County in southern Texas. One wall would stretch six miles and cut through the preserve, and the other would span eight miles. Both contracts were awarded to Galveston-based SLSCO Ltd. The two projects, totaling $312 million, would begin in February. The National Butterfly Center in Mission is just one of several places that would be affected by the new border wall. (Fox News) The government in the beginning stages of building the border wall, recently started issuing right of entry requests, giving them the right to explore the land to figure out where to best put up the wall. That has set up a potential battle between the government and longtime landowners in the area where the wall will go up. “For some of (the landowners), the land has been there for generations. It’s very meaningful to them,” said Efren Olivares, legal director for Racial and Economic Justice at the Texas Civil Rights Project, who has been working with several other landowners in the Valley, advising them on their rights and the government’s right of entry requests. “That’s why they don’t want it destroyed by building a wall through it.” Some believe the wall would degrade their property. “We’re going to lose 70 percent of our land to the border wall because the border wall is not on the border,” said Trevino-Wright, who has been fighting the project since July 2017. “In some places, the habitat would be bulldozed entirely.” The expected construction site in the National Butterfly Center is located about one mile north of the Rio Grande River, which divides the United States and Mexico. In October, the Trump administration waived 28 environmental and public-health laws to make way for the construction of 18 miles of border wall. While some local landowners here are against the wall, others are in favor of it, arguing they are fed up with migrants illegally entering the country through their land. The new wall would run along this levee road of the National Butterfly Center, separating 70 acres on the southern section of the levee. (Fox News) Othal Brand, president of Hidalgo County Water Improvement District 3, also received a right of entry request – but he was happy about it. “Some people say ‘oh, you want a wall?’ I believe in securing the border,” Brand said. “For those that live in a city, they can have a level of security and safety. But those of use that work outside of the city and work along the river, it is a totally different environment.” Brand, who has lived and worked along the river for generations, already has a border wall running through his land. He said he noticed a drop in illegal activity after it was built. Conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the move, saying it will destroy the area’s wildlife and natural habitat. But, security experts believe there’s a reason why the locations were chosen. “I do understand the unfortunate nature of some of these locations. On the flip side, though, you’re having these walls constructed in areas where you have heavy smuggling operations in both directions, which I think is an important aspect to remember here,” said Fred Burton, chief security officer at Stratfor. U.S. Customs and Border Protection have called the Rio Grande Valley Sector the busiest in the country for illegal activity. (Fox News) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has called the Rio Grande the busiest sector in the country. In the 2017 fiscal year, they arrested 137,000 illegal border crossers and seized 260,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,192 pounds of cocaine. CBP said they’ve met with landowners not only to request access to the property for survey but to also listen to their concerns. “Concerns are captured in order to incorporate them into the design of the wall,” CBP officials said. Olivares is pushing for the CBP to hold an open community meeting, which he said has not been done. He said the format would allow for more productive dialogue instead of individual meetings with agents. “We are trying to tell them (the landowners) that they have rights,” Olivares said. “They don’t have to do what the government tells them to do.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

Rep.-elect Haley Stevens, a Pelosi critic during the campaign, just met with Pelosi and said she spoke about a range of issues important to her Michigan district. She kept the door open to backing Pelosi. “I haven’t said no,” Stevens said More Pelosi-mentum. While Seth Moulton is bragging about his imaginary secret letter Pelosi is flipping votes. Secret letter? Moulton says he has a letter of many democrats who promise to vote against Pelosi on the floor. But he won't release it or even show it to reporters. Likely because there's many less names than he says I’m a constituent of his. Called his offices with my dismay. He has permanently tainted his political career and I will work to see him unseated. I had high hopes for him when he was elected but he has really disappointed me I signed his nomination papers last summer and offered to volunteer for his campaign. Now I see him for who he really is, a misogynistic centrist Democrat GOP wanna be. Whip those votes, Nancy! I'm from Michigan too and she needs to say yes! Is there a list of names of all these reps that are talking about not supporting @TeamPelosi ? What can normal folk like me (who's damn po'd with this) do? I'm ready to call, e-mail, etc. #TeamPelosi thank you @haleylive for reconsidering. I voted for you because I believed in your ability to get things done for our district and to make the right decisions for the betterment of this country and voting for pelosi to be the next speaker is a start Thank you, @HaleyLive. Appreciate your openness, Pelosi is a giant of the House no matter what happens & would do a fine job transitioning toward new leadership in 2020. Hope you’re enjoying DC!! Interesting , the only time CNN talks to DEMS is if there is controversy so Ya Manu DEMS are risking fracturing the party, PLEASE REPORT THAT SO THAT YOU SPEND AT LEAST A LITTLE TIME TALKING ABOUT DEMS instead of ready Trump tweets on the air.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-restores-jim-acostas-press-pass-cnn-drops-lawsuit_us_5bf31fb8e4b01909c8086d1d---split---The White House announced Monday that it would restore the press pass of CNN reporter Jim Acosta, leading the network to drop its pending lawsuit against the administration. “Having received a formal reply from your counsel to our letter of November 16, we have made a final determination in this process: your hard pass is restored,” the White House wrote in a letter to Acosta, according to CNN. “Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules set forth above. The President is aware of this decision and concurs.” The letter also included a revised code of conduct for journalists during presidential press conferences. Per White House letter to Acosta on Nov. 19, here are the new rules for press conferences at the White House. pic.twitter.com/a6C2pmLv2K The White House initially revoked Acosta’s press pass after a press conference on Nov. 7, during which the reporter and President Donald Trump had a heated exchange. A White House intern grabbed the microphone from the Acosta, and the White House later shared a sped-up video of the event that suggested the reporter used force against the intern. CNN sued the Trump administration for violating the First Amendment rights of both the network and its reporter. We stand by our decision to revoke this individual’s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video. pic.twitter.com/T8X1Ng912y Acosta’s pass was restored Friday after Judge Timothy J. Kelly ruled that Acosta’s right to due process had been violated. However, the White House indicated Friday in a letter that Acosta’s press pass could be revoked again as soon as the temporary restraining order granted by Kelly expired. The letter, signed by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine, claims Acosta “failed to abide” by “basic, widely understood practices.” Earlier on Monday, CNN sought an emergency court hearing in response to that letter. The filing was aimed at protecting Acosta’s access until the network’s initial lawsuit against the administration was decided. CNN’s communications department tweeted Monday afternoon that the network’s “lawsuit is no longer necessary” and that CNN looks “forward to continuing to cover the White House.” Acosta also tweeted on Monday afternoon, saying: “Thanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday... let’s get back to work.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

Today the @WhiteHouse fully restored @Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House. Thank you CNN for taking a strong stand for our freedom of the press and for supporting Jim Acosta who every day works to provide us with truth. The freedom of tg he press was never denied. CNN could have easily replaced Acosta The US isn't a country where the leader gets to choose who covers him. The world already has too many low-rent dictatorships where that's the case. No American should wish for it. I as an American wish for a fair and unbiased press, which seems to be something CNN is incapable of. You do realize that CNN holds something like 50 hard passes right? CNN was never not allowed in the white house. Just jim accoster. Facts, they matter. I as an American wish for a fair & unbiased press, which I know is something FOX is incapable of especially Hannity or FOX & Friends & yet I support a blanket free press in support of our constitution. Jim Acosta works for CNN & therefore can’t be denied access. Period! You do realize #Huckleberry said they’re revoking it as soon as the TRO expires, right? they dropped that plan when CNN said they were going back to court - now its : ask only 1 question if you try to follow up without permission we will ban you again. Acosta won't even show up then if he can't grandstand and make the presser about him you will soon be proved wrong No, he will show up. And when he refuses to follow the rules of conduct, he's gone and will go back to court and get his pass back You may not like Acosta’s style, but we need more journalists that push back with facts when the President lies to them. Keep fighting for the truth, Acosta! Acosta is a thug who has become a legend in the eyes of the media. No rules, no limit on number of questions, take posession of the mic and keep talking. When the liar in office won’t answer a question, I prefer a reporter who keeps hammering instead of giving in to the filibuster. What has Trump lied about? A lawsuit is no longer necessary but better behavior is. Ever been a reporter? It's not always easy to get the story and be polite. Trump does not answer questions--don't you believe he should be answering questions? How would you have the press handle it? CNN is not paying Acosta to be polite. They ARE paying him to get the story. Actually, it appears that they are paying him to BE the story. Not good journalism by any standard.

Check out Hannity’s comments here: Hannity attacked Acosta last week as well, claiming the CNN reporter was “a disservice to real journalists in the press corps.” The White House Correspondents’ Association disagrees with Hannity’s assessment.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-head-mississippi-amid-gop-concerns-senate-seat---split---Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith faces Democrat Mike Espy in a Nov. 27 runoff. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump will make an eleventh-hour attempt to keep a Mississippi Senate seat in Republican hands later this month when he headlines two rallies there the day before a runoff election. His campaign organization announced Saturday the president will hold two rallies on Nov. 26 on behalf of Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. He will be in Tupelo at 5 p.m. and then in Biloxi three hours later. Hyde-Smith faces former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in the special election runoff after neither cleared 50 percent in the Nov. 6 jungle primary, which saw two Republicans and two Democrats run together on the same ballot. Hyde-Smith was appointed to the seat in April after GOP Sen. Thad Cochran resigned over health reasons. The special election winner gets to serve out the final two years of Cochran’s term. Hyde-Smith earned national headlines in recent days after the release of video showing her making controversial remarks. In one, she’s heard saying she’d be “on the front row” if invited by a supporter to a public hanging. In another, she indicated support for making it “just a little more difficult” for liberal college students to vote. Her campaign has called the first remarks “an exaggerated expression of regard” for the supporter and said the latter comments were made in jest. The Mississippi Senate runoff gives Trump another chance to get back on the campaign trail after his frustrations with the media’s coverage of the midterms, which saw Republicans lose control of the House while picking up likely two seats to expand their narrow Senate majority. The president has painted the midterms as a success, pointing to the Senate gains, while arguing that previous presidents lost more House seats. He has also bragged about campaigning for 10 GOP candidates, saying he helped nine of them win. Inside Elections with Nathan L.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/public-hanging-mississippi-senate-runoff---split---Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., has provoked widespread outrage for joking about "public hanging" at a campaign event in a newly surfaced video. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) At a campaign event earlier this month, Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and her supporters laughed as she quipped about being in the front row of a “public hanging,” according to a newly surfaced video. “If he invited me to a public hanging, I’d be on the front row,” the Republican said in an embrace with one of her supporters, according to a video posted by an independent journalist to Twitter and Facebook on Sunday. Outraged observers say the Hyde-Smith’s comment evokes the bloody history of lynchings in Mississippi, which has the deadliest record of racist mob violence by hanging of any state in the United States, according to the NAACP. The video has also drawn new attention to her runoff race against Democratic challenger and former U.S. agriculture secretary Mike Espy, who is black. Hyde-Smith and Espy were the top performers on Election Day, but neither candidate garnered 50 percent of the vote, triggering a runoff. Mississippi voters will go to the polls again on Nov. 27. Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to fill Sen. Thad Cochran’s seat when he retired due to his health in March. "If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row"- Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith says in Tupelo, MS after Colin Hutchinson, cattle rancher, praises her.  Hyde-Smith referred to the remark as “an exaggerated expression of regard” in a statement. “In a comment on Nov. 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement,” said. “In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.” In its own statement, the Espy campaign called her comments “reprehensible.” “They have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country,” said Campaign Communications Director Danny Blanton. “We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgement to represent the people of our state.” The midterm election has stirred a debate about the role of race in U.S. politics as Democrats and other observers have accused Republicans across the country of appealing to racial animus. NAACP President Derrick Johnson drew a parallel from Hyde-Smith’s remarks to President Donald Trump. They “prove once again how Trump has created a social and political climate that normalizes hateful and racist rhetoric,” he said in a statement. “Hyde-Smith’s decision to joke about ‘hanging,’ in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African Americans is sick,” he said. “To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people, Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful. Any politician seeking to serve as the national voice of the people of Mississippi should know better. Her choice of words serves as an indictment of not only her lack of judgement, but her lack of empathy, and most of all lack of character.” Hyde-Smith's voting record closely aligns with the White House’s policy agenda; the senator has campaigned on building a wall at the southern border with Mexico and supported the president’s ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries. Hyde-Smith and Espy will participate in a debate on Nov. 20.

An anti-migrant demonstrator is surrounded by the press as she argues with a woman during a protest against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018. Protesters accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana; complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an "invasion," and voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group as they wait possibly months to apply for U.S. asylum. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd) The border fence that divides Mexico with the United States is seen in Tecate, Mexico, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd) TIJUANA, Mexico – The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants. The U.S. also closed one of two pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro crossing in a move apparently aimed at preventing any mass rush of migrants across the border. The installation of movable, wire-topped barriers threatens to complicate life for Mexicans using San Ysidro, where about 110,000 people enter the U.S. every day in 40,000 vehicles. Long lines backed up in Tijuana, where many people have to cross the border to work on the U.S. side. Such inconveniences prompted by the arrival of the migrant caravan may have played a role in Sunday's protests, when about 400 Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted "Out! Out!" referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week. Tensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road — and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived. Some Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an "invasion." And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group. "We don't want them in Tijuana," protesters shouted. Juana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records. A block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don't represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: "Childhood has no borders." Most of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats. But the journey has been hard, and many have turned around. Alden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. "We want them to return to Honduras," said Rivera. The migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an "avalanche" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx. Tijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000. At the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. "We are fleeing violence," said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. "How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?" Elsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S. Edwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer. U.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S. Trump wrote that like Tijuana, "the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!" He followed that tweet by writing: "Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away." ___ Associated Press writer Julie Watson contributed to this story from Tijuana and Marcos Aleman contributed from San Salvador.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/melvin-watt-fhfa-sexual-harassment---split---Federal Housing Finance Agency Direct0r Melvin Watt has been accused by a subordinate of unwanted advances and sexual harassment. (Chris Maddaloni/CQ Roll Call file photo) A Federal Housing Finance Agency manager leveled charges of unwanted advances and sexual harassment against Director Melvin Watt during a hearing Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee. Simone Grimes testified that beginning in 2015, when she brought to the regulator’s attention that she was to be paid less than her predecessor in an executive position, Watt offered her a “number of positions” but made clear each time that he had “an attraction” to her. “Director Watt made multiple unwanted advances toward me,” she told the committee. “The frequency of these advances . . . led me to begin recording many of our interactions,” said Grimes, who has brought an Equal Pay action in federal court against the agency and Watt. She also has accused the FHFA Office of Inspector General in its investigation of her allegations to have exhibited a “lack of independence.” Grimes testified that she recorded 15 conversations with Watt that she believes a listener would conclude amounted to harassment. She said she turned all the recordings over to the committee and that the inspector general's office has sued her to obtain copies. Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, emphasizing that the committee “is not a court of law,” cast the allegations against Watt and other investigations, including the committee’s investigation, as indicators of problems at the regulator and the entities it regulates. “Housing finance is in dire need of reform and FHFA is in dire need of oversight,” Hensarling said. He noted that a simultaneous hearing a the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh might overshadow his panel’s hearing. “I’m not sure this hearing will be heard, but it should,” he said. Watt is scheduled to testify later Thursday, as is Laura Wertheimer, the FHFA’s inspector general who has investigated the allegations. Testimony filed by Wertheimer and Watt did not make reference to Grimes' allegations. “Since these allegations were raised, the Agency and the Director have had separate legal counsel on this matter,” the FHFA said in a statement Thursday. The agency said there are currently three investigations into the allegations, by the FHFA inspector general, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and by the U.S. Postal Service on behalf of FHFA. There is also a federal lawsuit that FHFA is a party to based on the Equal Pay Act, the agency said. “[Watt] has not made any decisions on behalf of the Agency with respect to any of these legal reviews,” the statement said. “Further, the Director has had no involvement of any kind in any employment decisions relating to the complainant since these allegations were raised." Ranking member Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who had urged Hensarling to allow Grimes’ testimony, said that she has long been a friend of former Rep. Watt, who served on the Financial Services committee when he was a Democratic member from North Carolina. “If this were a jury in a court of law, I would need to recuse myself,” Water said. “But this is not a jury or a trial. I have a responsibility to ensure that Simone Grimes, who has raised deeply troubling allegations against [Watt] . . . is heard before this committee.” Republicans on the committee have been critical of FHFA’s 10-year oversight of housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, since the pair were taken into federal conservatorship at the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. Both parties have said they were in favor of overhauling the finance system, but have not passed legislation to do so. However, the parties tend to disagree over Fannie and Freddie’s roles in making homeownership more affordable for lower-income families. Democrats are more supportive of the effort and have been concerned about the agency lowering its support for such programs after Watt’s term in office ends in January and President Donald Trump chooses a nominee for the post.

---split---2.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-democrats-are-in-disarray-does-that-spell-trouble-for-2020---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. With Dems disagreeing over health care, what does this mean for the rest of their agenda? GOP strategist Amy Tarkanian and Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright debate. New York Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted last week: “We have tremendous unity in our caucus. That unity has been our strength, and it will continue to be as strong as ever in the 116th Congress.” Mr. Schumer knows better. Democrats are not unified at all, as the skirmishes over leadership positions in Congress have shown. Word has it that Mr. Schumer was reelected Minority Leader by acclamation, but that unanimous vote posed a problem for Kyrsten Sinema, newly elected Democrat senator from Arizona, who had promised to oppose him. Forced to explain why she broke a campaign pledge, Ms. Sinema, who ran as a moderate in her reddish state, said, “Had there been a challenger for minority leader, I would have considered new leadership and a fresh perspective.” Meanwhile, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in the fight of her life to regain the Speaker’s gavel. Many still expect the unpopular representative from California to succeed, but the emergence in recent days of a possible rival – Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge – could give her opponents a boost. Up until now the dozen-plus Democrats who have openly contested her election have had no one to rally around. Now they do. Skirmishes over leadership posts are nothing new, for either political party, but Democrats face more than power struggles. They face serious discord over policy, with the progressive left clearly at odds with establishment figures like Schumer and Pelosi, and with party members who represent red states. In coming months Mr. Schumer and his counterpart in the House will play ringmasters to a slew of newly elected Democrats eager to challenge establishment liberals like himself. These disrupters, like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have already shown a lack of respect for the traditions and hierarchies of Congress. Moreover, they embrace policies anathema to mainstream voters who will likely determine the outcome of the 2020 elections. Mr. Schumer is going to have his hands full. Republican leaders in Congress, like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, might be forgiven a moment of schadenfreude. They have frequently had trouble corralling their own disparate elements, like the Freedom Caucus in the House. The embarrassing failure to upend ObamaCare came down, ultimately, to fundamental disagreements about the role of government in providing health care. By contrast, Democrats have, in recent years, mostly sung from the same songbook. That is about to change. Consider the divide between Senator Jon Tester from Montana and the progressive Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. On gun control: Ocasio-Cortez backs universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and, on her website says she “wants to require Congresspeople to take no money from the gun lobby or private equity companies that invest in the firearms industry.” Questionable syntax aside, Ms. Cortez essentially advocates abolishing the rights upheld by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC. In this past cycle, there was no unifying theme for the Democrats other than disapproval of President Trump. That wasn’t strong enough to take the Senate this year, and it won’t be enough to win the White House in 2020. Jon Tester has a different position on guns: he loves them. Campaigning in Montana, Tester touted his votes in support of the Second Amendment, and his opposition to banning high caliber weapons. He furthered his gun-toting credentials by bragging during his reelection run that he had shot hundreds of cows and hogs on his farm, and also gophers. Videos of the senator plugging docile farm animals have been circulating online. On climate change: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when, on her freshman orientation tour, she joined a sit-in in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding action to prevent climate change. More recently the New York progressive advocated for a sweeping Green New Deal, under which 100 percent of U.S. power generation would come from renewable sources, in ten years. The “deal” also requires total “decarbonization” of the manufacturing, agricultural and other industries as well as of transportation and other infrastructure. Jon Tester, hailing from the state with the nation’s largest coal reserves, as well as substantial oil and natural gas production, supports an “energy economy powered by Montana commonsense,” as he states on his website. In 2016 he introduced legislation to expand carbon capture tax credits, which provides tax credits to coal power producers and companies that capture carbon dioxide from their units. At the time he noted, "Coal plays a pivotal role in Montana's energy future. While some folks around the country are turning their backs on coal, I am pushing to expand the Carbon Capture Tax Credit to provide coal country with more financial certainty and encourage American innovation and investments in clean coal technology." On health care: The New York freshman advocates Medicare for All, and “people-centered” health care, as opposed to health care centered on, for instance, forest creatures. She says on her website that her proposal will drive down costs “by allowing all people in the US to buy into a universal healthcare system.” In interviews, she has repeatedly deflected questions about who will pick up the estimated $33 trillion tab for such an adventure. A year ago, when Bernie Sanders introduced his “Medicare for All” bill, Jon Tester opposed it. He said at the time, “I support fixing what we got because I think that’s more likely to happen.” Tester voted for and supports ObamaCare, even though he admits that “there were plenty of mistakes” made with the bill, and even though premiums have increased in his state by 133 percent between 2013 and 2017. Tester and Ocasio-Cortez may represent the outer fringes of Democrat opinion, but there are plenty who fall nearby, on both ends. Tensions will mount as party leaders try to reward the voters who gave them the majority in the House by writing and passing legislation; there will be winners and losers. In that process, party leaders will hope to mold a coherent platform for 2020; it won’t be easy. Not easy, but necessary. In this past cycle, there was no unifying theme other than disapproval of President Trump. That wasn’t strong enough to take the Senate this year, and it won’t be enough to win the White House in 2020.

---split---2.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/maines-bruce-poliquin-loses-ranked-choice-voting---split---Maine Rep. Bruce Poliquin has lost to Democrat Jared Golden. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Democrat Jared Golden has defeated Maine Rep. Bruce Poliquin in the nation’s first use of ranked-choice voting for a congressional race, according to state election officials. The Democrat won just over 50 percent of the vote in the ranked-choice tabulation, meaning he’ll be the next congressman from the 2nd District unless Poliquin’s legal challenges to the voting system prevail. A Golden win in the 2nd District, which President Donald Trump carried in 2016, mean Democrats have picked up 35 seats and wiped out all New England Republicans in the House. Poliquin led Golden by less than a point on the first count, but since neither candidate received 50 percent of the vote, the state’s ranked-choice voting system kicked in to determine the winner. The new system, which voters have twice approved at the ballot box, lets voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no one receives a majority, the last-place finisher is eliminated and his or her votes reallocated to the candidates whom voters ranked second. The process continues until someone secures more than 50 percent of the vote. A federal judge on Thursday morning rejected a lawsuit from Poliquin that sought to stop the secretary of state from running the ranked-choice voting tabulation. But Poliquin’s suit had also asked the district court judge to rule ranked-choice voting unconstitutional, and in a statement after Thursday morning’s ruling, his campaign said it planned to further litigate its constitutional concerns over the voting system, even if Poliquin had won under the new system. Poliquin reiterated that commitment in a statement after the ranked-choice tabulation resulted in a win for Golden. “It is now officially clear I won the constitutional ‘one-person, one-vote’ first choice election on Election Day that has been used in Maine for more than one hundred years,” Poliquin said. “We will proceed with our constitutional concerns about the rank vote algorithm.” Golden, the state House Assistant Majority Leader, is a Marine veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Leeds native, a former committee staffer to GOP Sen. Susan Collins, represents part of Lewiston-Auburn, an old mill town on the Androscoggin River that makes up the major population center of the district. Democrats held the 2nd District in northern Maine for 20 years before Poliquin flipped the seat when it opened in 2014. He defeated Democrat Emily Cain.

The Pentagon has directed U.S. military commanders to stop calling the deployment of active-duty troops to the southern border “Operation Faithful Patriot,” a name derided by critics as overtly political while President Trump played up the mission in stumping for Republican candidates. The decision was acknowledged Wednesday after the midterm elections, and it was not immediately clear what name the military operation may ultimately take instead. “We are no longer calling it Operation Faithful Patriot,” said a Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Jamie Davis. “We are referring to it as border support. I have nothing further at this time.” A second Pentagon spokesman, Chris Sherwood, said that simply referring to the military operation as “border support” is a “more accurate description” because the Department of Homeland Security is overseeing it. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the directive was issued by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s office on Election Day. He has sought to shield the military from politics, with mixed results. The operation has come under fire from some retired generals, who say it unnecessarily thrusts the military into politics. Trump sought to characterize migrants traveling north through Mexico from Central America in a “caravan” as an “invasion” of the United States. In reality, the group is believed to consist almost entirely of families who could legally apply for asylum at ports of entry at the border. The operation, announced Oct. 29, is in support of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. The Pentagon has sought to stress that it has only a support role, while the president has suggested that the military will face the migrants at the border. Army Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday that the administration specifically asked for active-duty service members to deploy for the operation. They are limited in what they can do by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits federal military from involvement in most domestic law enforcement missions in the United States. About 5,200 active-duty troops were expected to be involved in Faithful Patriot by Monday. The military has deployed the U.S. military to the border before, but not in such large numbers of active-duty troops in a century. More typically, National Guard units, which operate under state authority, are called upon to provide support. The U.S. military has released dozens of photos and videos in recent days of service members on the border, including some Tuesday of Air Force Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, chief of U.S. Northern Command, visiting service members deployed to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base as part of the operation. To date, the Pentagon has not allowed any independent media to cover the operations and provide a fuller account of what is occurring.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-republican.html---split---Supported by Republicans capped a popular deduction for state and local taxes to pay for the tax bill. That may have hurt some House Republicans in the midterms. By Jim Tankersley and Ben Casselman President Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut was supposed to be a big selling point for congressional Republicans in the midterm elections. Instead, it appears to have done more to hurt, than help, Republicans in high-tax districts across California, New Jersey, Virginia and other states. House Republicans suffered heavy Election Day losses in districts where large concentrations of taxpayers claim a popular tax break — the state and local tax deduction — which the law capped at $10,000 per household. The new limit resulted in an effective tax increase for high-earning residents of high-tax states who claim more than $10,000 per year in SALT. Democrats swept four Republican-held districts in Orange County, Calif., where at least 40 percent of taxpayers claim the SALT tax break, defeating a pair of Republican incumbents and winning seats vacated by Representatives Ed Royce and Darrell Issa. Those districts include longtime Republican strongholds, like Newport Beach, and rank among the country’s largest users of the state and local tax break. Representative Barbara Comstock lost a seat in Northern Virginia, where more than half of taxpayers claim the SALT deduction, by nearly 13 points. Representative Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, a huge champion of the tax bill, lost by about the same margin in a district where 40 percent of taxpayers claim the deduction. “The state and local tax deduction being capped at $10,000 hurt a lot of people in our district and our state,” Mike Levin, a Democrat who won an open seat that was previously held by Mr. Issa, said in an interview shortly before the election. The SALT cap may not have been the primary motivation for voters in choosing Democratic candidates. But a review of polling data over the past year suggests that the limit has some key Republican constituencies feeling bittersweet about the new law — and more willing to back Democrats in House elections. New Jersey Democrats wasted little time after the election to begin pushing to lift the SALT cap. On Monday, Representatives Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer called for reinstatement of the full deduction, in a news conference in front of a salt depot in Ramsey, N.J. Before the new law, taxpayers could deduct the full amount of state and local taxes — including income and property taxes — they paid each year from their federal tax returns. The deduction particularly benefits high earners who are more likely to itemize their deductions, instead of claiming the standard deduction. And it tends to benefit taxpayers in more liberal states, like New York and California, where tax rates are often higher. It also costs the federal government billions of dollars each year and lawmakers looked to limit the tax break to help pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut. The cap is expected to generate about $70 billion per year, according to the Tax Policy Center. In their first draft of a tax bill last year, House Republicans proposed to scrap the deduction entirely. That caused an outcry from several Republican lawmakers who represent high-tax districts in New Jersey and California. Even after party leaders offered the $10,000 cap as a compromise, several of those Republicans voted against the final bill, saying it would raise taxes for their constituents. Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, in an op-ed column explaining his ‘no’ vote, said that the law “would raise taxes for many of my constituents.” Representative John J. Faso of New York complained in a news release that the SALT cap “impacts New York families more severely than those in other states.” Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Faso lost their seats, as did Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who similarly voted against the tax bill. The law, as enacted, cuts taxes for most Americans in the first year. But about two million Americans who claim more than $10,000 a year under SALT will see a net tax increase this year from the law, according to the independent Tax Policy Center in Washington. They account for about 1 percentage point of the 6.3 percent of taxpayers who will see a tax increase this year from the changes to the individual tax code, the center’s data shows. Analyses suggest that group skews heavily toward households earning $200,000 or more. In the months leading up to the election, the online research platform SurveyMonkey interviewed nearly 30,000 registered voters about their opinions on the tax law, their voting intentions and other topics. A New York Times analysis of that data suggests that the cap on the SALT deduction may have had a significant effect on voters’ views of the tax law — and perhaps even on how they voted. Voters in areas where a large share of households take the SALT deduction were significantly more likely to say that they opposed the tax law. That was true even controlling for factors like education, income and partisanship. Even among Republicans, the tax law was significantly less popular in ZIP codes where a large share of households took the SALT deduction in 2016. Voters in those areas were also more likely to say they planned to support Democratic candidates in the midterms, although it is unlikely enough votes were swayed to affect the outcome in all but the tightest of congressional races. (Other factors, such as education, gender and race had a far bigger impact.) By contrast, there is essentially no evidence that other elements of the tax law helped Republicans. Republican incumbents fared no better in districts where voters got larger tax cuts, for example. And a majority of independent voters said they opposed the law, according to the SurveyMonkey data.

District-level deduction estimates are based on county-level tax records. Vote swings are based on estimates of districts’ previous voting behavior from FiveThirtyEight. | Sources: Associated Press, I.R.S., FiveThirtyEight. By The New York Times Republicans struggled in the suburbs in the midterms, for many reasons — chief among them a growing dislike for Mr. Trump among voters who graduated from college, especially women. Those losses included a drubbing in the districts where the SALT deduction is most heavily claimed. Democrats won 10 of the 20 Republican-held districts where the largest proportion of taxpayers claim the deduction, including seats in California, Virginia and New Jersey. Some Democratic challengers in those districts criticized the SALT limit on the campaign trail. Still, there is little evidence to suggest that SALT alone tipped those districts toward Democrats, who largely focused on health care in their policy pitch to voters. The SALT provision appears to have gone largely unmentioned in Democratic attack ads: Researchers at the Wesleyan Media Project compiled a full report on mentions of tax issues in House campaigns, and SALT did not appear anywhere in their findings. Democrats don’t have much chance of repealing the cap in the next two years, because Republicans still hold the Senate and the White House. Even if they controlled the whole government, Democrats might struggle to repeal the caps — because they would be, in effect, reversing a tax increase on well-off Americans. Simply reinstating the unlimited cap, without also reversing the changes to the alternative minimum tax, would deliver no benefit to low-income and middle-class Americans, according to a new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank. More than 85 percent of the benefits would go to the top 5 percent of American income earners. The top 1 percent of income earners would see an average tax cut of $35,000 each. That math may be difficult to sell to a Democratic base that spent the past year calling the Trump tax cuts a giveaway to the rich. Jim Tankersley covers economic and tax policy.

Destruction caused by the Carr Fire in Redding, Calif., this summer.CreditCreditJohn Locher/Associated Press Supported by By John Branch NOVATO, Calif. — It was 90 degrees that afternoon, but at a rest stop along Interstate 5 in the mountains of Northern California, it snowed flakes of ash on my pickup. The wildfire raging nearby was about as bad as anyone could imagine, but our imaginations hadn’t reached November yet. This was August, long before we lost Paradise and much of Malibu, before the fiery hellscapes at opposite ends of a state under siege lit up screens around the world. This was before the long-fading myth of California as Eden was scorched into some sort of Mad Max dystopia, before teams of forensic examiners were sent to sift through the ashes to find the dozens, maybe hundreds, of missing dead. It was when there was still hope that the latest big fire would be the last one to worry about for a while. The hot, smoky summer air smelled like campfire. A worried asthmatic woman headed to San Diego asked me when it would end. Other side of Redding, I said. I wasn’t sure. Maybe Sacramento. Just keep going. The Carr Fire burned for six weeks and scorched about 230,000 acres — a bigger area than the five boroughs of New York City combined. It destroyed about 1,600 buildings and killed at least three people. Its smoke carried halfway across the country, proving that California’s influence spreads in peculiar ways. I followed the woman south through the mountains and soon spotted something moving under a long bridge, below the choking haze. Down on Lake Shasta, there were boaters and water skiers. I laughed. That’s so California, I thought. Heavenly and hellish, sometimes simultaneously. It’s after Election Day now. The Camp Fire in Butte County is now California’s deadliest ever, and the Woolsey Fire in and around Malibu chased out a quarter-million evacuees in its first days. I live in the Bay Area, nowhere near the fires but persistently reminded of them. My neighborhood slinks through the rugged hills of dry grass and trees, terrain not unlike what we’ve seen burning on television. It hasn’t rained in six weeks; before that, not since spring. The toxic drift from the Camp Fire has made our air so murky that schools closed. Ash falls again on my truck, parked in the driveway. Twitter delivered the first message from President Trump about the fires. “There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,” Trump wrote, finding little use for empathy or truth. “Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” It was the latest in a series of perplexing verbal missives aimed at California. Californians know all about outsider ambivalence toward the Golden State. It has been going on for generations. Love it or hate it. Now those feelings have spread wide and deep into the national political discourse. All across the country, California represents a foil for people who worry that it foreshadows the future of the country, as it always has. “Are we going to turn into California?” one candidate for governor in Nevada said in October, a derisive echo of campaign talk across the West. California, we were told, was an overpriced and overregulated land of marauding immigrants and straw-less restaurants. And now, post-election, look at it — burning at both ends, the recent setting of another unexplained mass shooting, a place with both abject poverty and astronomical housing costs, everyone waiting for the big earthquake. Funny, I think, every time I hear California insulted. I choose to live here. There is no other place I’d rather raise my children. I’m always proud to say I’m from California, a beautiful and messy place unlike any other, in a moment unlike any other. One in eight Americans live here. If California were a country, it would represent the world’s fifth-biggest economy. It is the most diverse state in the country, by measures of geography, economy, culture and demographics. Always a trendsetter, California today is the United States of tomorrow. That scares plenty of people. It relieves others. California has a unique combination of influence and ambition, an assuredness that rubs some people the wrong way, and now it feels ready to use its power to blunt the forces from the White House, 3,000 miles away. California already has sued the Trump administration 44 times, on issues involving immigration status, health care, the border wall and fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. The administration has sued California three times, including over net neutrality and sanctuary status. Pick a side: California represents a threat; California represents an ideal. It is the enemy or the answer, a roadblock or the resistance. It’s much more complex for the 40 million of us who live here. It is more paradox than paradise. Life would be simpler someplace else, if I thought that was the point. I bemoan the ever-worsening traffic. I’m aghast at the levels of homelessness. I’m disappointed in the public schools. I bought my house six years ago, and there is no chance I could afford it at its supposed value today. I worry that I’m raising children in a place they will never afford for themselves. I hope they don’t have to leave to find the life they want. Some have had enough. The population still climbs because of arrivals from other countries and higher rates of birth than death. But for years, more people have left California than moved into it from other states. Most of us are digging in. It’s exciting to be on the front lines to many of this country’s biggest problems — climate change and energy, economic disparity and infrastructure, race and immigration among them. Ingrained with a wanderlust that I try to foist on my children, I probably see more of California than most. If I plotted my in-state movements over the last three months on a California map, it would look like someone confused, looking for an exit, circling like a caged cat. On one Saturday afternoon, I crossed the northern border from Oregon and drove more than 1,000 miles, all in California, by Sunday evening. (It’s a long story.) I have made trips to Crescent City on the northern coast and San Diego on the southern one. I have been to Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield and Tehachapi, all on separate trips. I have been to two national parks (Yosemite and Redwoods), 500 miles apart. Here might be the most California sentence of all: The only reason we canceled our weekend camping reservations at Lassen Volcanic National Park in October was that my son had an appointment at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the earliest it could be rescheduled was December. All those excursions came as California-bashing boiled over. It changed my perspective as I looked around. What will California represent once the smoke clears? The grapes were plump on the vine, and there was little sign of the swath of death and destruction that began here a year ago, off tiny Bennett Lane, just a few miles north of Calistoga in the Napa Valley. Just a few charred trees on a hillside and more on the hill after that. They named it the Tubbs Fire, because it was initially thought to have started off Tubbs Lane, not nearby Bennett Lane. It was, at the time, the most destructive fire in California’s history. Like a nightmare, it started after dark and did most of its damage by dawn. It killed 22 people and destroyed about 4,000 homes, fueled by 80-mile-an-hour gusts and the element of surprise. The inferno mowed through miles of rugged, dark mountains and through a seemingly random sample of golf-course homes of the Fountaingrove area. A year later, most of the lots now are clear and dormant. Many are for sale — this scorched one for $270,000, that one for $395,000 — their former occupants presumably paid off by insurance or chased out by the ghosts. The course is still green, though. The fire reached Santa Rosa in just a few overnight hours. It burned down a Hilton, just missed a hospital, jumped the freeway and took out a Kmart and a mobile-home park. And it roared through 1,300 homes of Coffey Park, a compact and quiet little city neighborhood, far from the hills. Now the neighborhood is a hive of construction, a resurrection of cut lumber and framed walls amid a few scorched tree trunks. The clear air is punctuated from dawn to dusk by saws and nail guns, Mexican music and chatter in Spanish. Trucks — electricians, plumbers, window installers, taco sellers — clog the streets. Fire represents both destruction and restoration. California knows the cycle. The Tubbs Fire was just one of several that broke out in little-known corners of wine country late that night. I live about 30 miles south of Santa Rosa. I had returned home the night before, after a week in Las Vegas, where I helped The Times cover a mass shooting. Among the 58 dead, I learned once I got there, was the mother of a girl on my daughter’s soccer team. I was reminded of that again this month, when someone gunned down 12 people at a bar in Thousand Oaks. My family has been to Thousand Oaks too many times to count, because my best friend used to live there. The night after the shooting, he was awakened in Florida by text messages telling him to evacuate because of a rapidly growing blaze soon to be known as the Woolsey Fire. It’s sad and strange to think that if the fire had come a couple of days earlier, nobody would have been at the bar to be shot. The day I returned from covering the Las Vegas shooting, my home phone rang around midnight — late enough that you knew there was no good news on the other end. It was my father-in-law. He and his wife, both in their 80s, lived in a seniors-only neighborhood near Santa Rosa and were awakened by a ferocious wind rattling the windows. Fearing shattered glass, they rushed to the spare bedroom. It glowed orange from the light outside. A nearby ridge was aflame. Neighbors gathered in the street, in the howling wind and smoke, trying to make sense of it. There had been no fires when they went to bed. The blazes not only seem to be getting bigger, but faster. My in-laws called to say that they were taking their dog and heading to the safety of a grocery store parking lot a few miles away. Ninety minutes later, they called again. At 3-something in the morning, they showed up at our door, certain that they would never see their home again. For 10 days, they stayed at our house as fires burned in uncontrolled blotches around theirs. Their house survived. The hills are still scarred black. They recently couldn’t see the hills at all, because thick smoke from the faraway Camp Fire had settled into the valley. My wife and I hiked in those burned hills a few weeks ago. The coastal redwoods deep in the shady canyons were among the few trees to survive. They almost always do. Redwoods are naturally resistant to fire, which partly explains how some have lived 2,000 years and grown nearly 400 feet tall. It’s the state tree, which feels appropriate. It rained at my house in early October, for the first time since May, and the brown hills where I run in my free time soon flashed a hint of undergrowth. In California, the grass is greenest in winter. I’ve always found it a fitting metaphor, now more than ever. Advertisement
---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-jim-acostas-press-pass-cnn-seeks/story?id=59291734---split---The Trump White House in a letter says it is dropping its effort to suspend the press pass belonging to CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta but has outlined a set of rules that, if they aren't followed, "may result in suspension or revocation" of a journalist's press pass. "Your hard pass is restored," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine wrote to Acosta. "Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules," they wrote after outlining the rules. Trump was "aware of this decision and concurs," according to the letter. Following the letter from the White House Monday afternoon, CNN dropped the case in court. "Today the White House fully restored Jim Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House," CNN said in a statement. The letter from the White House outlines four rules: a journalist "will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists," follow-up questions will be permitted "at the discretion of the president or other White House officials taking questions," "yielding the floor" is defined as "physically surrendering" the microphone and, lastly, "failure to abide" by any of the rules may result in "suspension or revocation of the journalist's hard pass." Acosta was stripped of his press pass without warning earlier this month after a heated exchange during a press conference with President Donald Trump one day after the midterm elections. His press pass was temporarily restored by a court order Friday and the judge ordered both legal teams to submit a status report detailing how they would like to proceed by 3 p.m. on Monday. The Friday ruling guaranteed Acosta use of his press pass to the White House through the end of the month. But over the weekend, the White House wasted no time informing Acosta of a “preliminary decision” to suspend his pass after that period is up. Lawyers for CNN responded Monday by filing for an emergency hearing the week after Thanksgiving, “or as soon thereafter as possible.”   The letter cites “behavior” at a press conference the day after the midterms that “violated the basic standards governing such events” as the reason to suspend Acosta’s pass. It’s signed by Bill Shine, deputy chief of staff for communications, and Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary, who are both named as defendants in the initial lawsuit. Over the weekend, Acosta and CNN’s legal team wrote back to Sanders and Shine, calling the letter an “attempt to provide retroactive due process” and requesting the White House “refrain from — yet again — violating the constitutional rights of CNN and Acosta.” In the letter, Acosta wrote that there were "no so-called 'widely understood practices'" governing press conferences, which the White House jumped on in outlining four rules on Monday.   CNN filed a lawsuit earlier this week claiming that revoking Acosta's press pass to the White House, known as a "hard pass," violated the First Amendment.   U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly repeatedly emphasized at the court hearing on Friday that his decision to return Acosta's press pass, with a temporary restraining order as litigation continues, was based on the Fifth Amendment, under which the judge ruled Acosta was denied his right to due process. Due process would give Acosta and CNN the chance to rebut and challenge the appropriateness of the government’s action. In his closing remarks, Kelly made clear that the ruling, which is only the beginning of the court proceedings to decide Acosta’s White House access, was narrow and didn’t determine whether or not Acosta’s First Amendment right was violated.

---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-mississippi-runoff-tests-democrats-momentum/story?id=59282557---split---The TAKE with Rick Klein Overtime is over in Georgia and Florida now after Democrats ran out of options -- and are short of votes -- in both southern states. That leaves Mississippi looming as a challenge and an opportunity for a party that wants to show it can compete everywhere, and win, even where it's not supposed to. There are a few reasons to think that the Mississippi Senate runoff, scheduled for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, would offer the right mix of circumstances for a Democratic upset. Democrat Mike Espy only advanced to this round of voting because the two major Republicans split votes two weeks ago. But Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., has made a series of public statements that raise the stakes on matters of race and voting rights. The issues are all too familiar for Democrats after campaigns that fell short in Georgia and Florida. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., campaigned for Espy over the weekend, calling out "racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia." Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., will campaign in the state on Monday and President Donald Trump will stump for Hyde-Smith next week, on the eve of the runoff. The race is sufficiently nationalized at this point. Democrats who want to sustain momentum from Election Day will face an early -- if not entirely fair -- test.   The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks After visiting literal scorched earth in California this weekend, Trump cooled his usual slash-and-burn politics. California Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday the president had the state's residents' backs. After first threatening to pull federal funding to the state, the president since promised to send emergency aid. Brown praised the decision. "In the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities," Brown said on CBS's Face the Nation. "So I think we're on a good path." The president received strong rebukes for his initial comments about land mismanagement, given the Republican Party's silence on climate change and the fact that the federal government actually owns and controls a significant majority of California's forests.   The TIP with John Verhovek The area once referred to by President Ronald Reagan as the place where "good Republicans go to die" and the home Richard Nixon's presidential library will have no Republican members of Congress come January 2019. Before 2016, Orange County, California, hadn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since the Great Depression. And in 2018, Democrats flipped four OC-based congressional districts on their way to reclaiming the House majority. Democrats hold 45 of California's 53 seats in the U.S. House, and those members now compose nearly 20 percent of the entire Democratic caucus. The result is a testament to Democrats' efforts in the area during June's jungle primary, where they spent millions to ensure that despite all candidates running on one ballot regardless of party, they were not locked out of the general election. It is also undeniably a sign of the shifting political ground in many parts of the country. "America used to be a country of regional parties within each party, while both parties are on the path of losing this important representation, the path of the GOP is nearly complete to a nationalized ideological right-wing party," ABC News Chief Political Analyst Matthew Dowd said last week.

---split---3.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-appointment-matthew-whitaker-acting-attorney-general-unconstitutional/story?id=59279730---split---The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said President Donald Trump’s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general was unconstitutional because the attorney general is a “principal officer” and those positions require Senate confirmation under the Constitution. “I think the appointment is unconstitutional,” Rep. Adam Schiff of California told “This Week” co-anchor Martha Raddatz in an interview Sunday morning. “He is clearly a principal officer and the fact that he is a temporary principal officer doesn't mean that that is any less subject to Senate confirmation.” “Will Democrats still challenge that appointment and are you concerned about him overseeing the Mueller investigation?” Raddatz asked Schiff. “Yes and yes,” said Schiff, who will be the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee in the new Congress. “When you have a specific statute that says this is the succession plan and doesn't say you can also use the Vacancies Act to avoid the succession plan, you go with the specific statute,” Schiff said.     The president took to Twitter early Sunday afternoon to respond to Schiff’s criticism, pointing out that Mueller had not been approved by the Senate. Trump also misspelled Schiff's name in the tweet.  So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!  "Wow, Mr. President, that’s a good one. Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller’s questions, or did you write this one yourself?" Schiff replied on Twitter, referencing a statement Trump made Friday about his written answers to the special counsel. "I write the answers. My lawyers don't write answers," the president said during a cybersecurity initiative bill signing in the Oval Office. "I was asked a series of questions, I answered them very easily." The White House has not responded to an ABC News request for comment.     During his interview with Raddatz, Schiff called Whitaker's appointment flawed. “The biggest flaw from my point of view is that he was chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation,” he said.   Because Whitaker has publicly criticized Mueller’s investigation in the past, including in an August 2017 op-ed for CNN, Schiff said that “ethically he should have absolutely nothing to do with the investigation.” While Schiff is a frequent critic of the president’s, some Republicans have doubted whether Whitaker is right to permanently lead the Justice Department.   In a separate interview on “This Week,” Sen. Roy Blunt, who serves as the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Senate Republican Conference, said he didn’t think Whitaker should be attorney general. “I don't know Matt Whitaker well,” Blunt told Raddatz. “On the occasions I've had with him to be -- he's been very responsive and has seen that the Justice Department responded to the things I've asked about. So in terms of an acting capacity, he does not -- he seems to be a person that has the ability to do that acting job.”   “But not a permanent position; is that what you're saying?” Raddatz pressed. “Well, I would think -- I -- I would think not. But that's -- the president needs to determine who's going to be permanently at the Justice Department as soon as he can,” he said.

Researchers collected Facebook posts from members’ official Facebook accounts using the social media platform’s application programming interface (API) for public pages. Researchers obtained 447,684 posts from 581 unique members of Congress across the two most recent Congresses. Next, they identified all Facebook posts that included links to other websites: a total of 177,467 posts, which represent 40% of all posts in the original sample. Researchers standardized these links by identifying their domain1 in order to measure how often members shared information from particular websites. The research team then classified all sites that were linked to at least 25 times, determining which contained news or information related to current events directed at a national audience.2 In total, 42,219 posts – 9.4% of all posts – contained links to national news outlets with stories shared at least 25 times. A total of 106 news outlets were included in the analysis, and all of them are listed in the report Methodology. Additional details about data collection and processing are also included in the Methodology. Political divides in the American news landscape do not end with Americans’ preferences for different news sources; rather, they extend to how members of the U.S. Congress communicate with constituents in the digital age. Between January 2015 and July 2017, nearly half (48%) of the links to national news outlets that members of Congress shared on Facebook were to outlets predominantly linked to by members of just one party, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis.3 What’s more, 5% of these news links pointed to outlets that were exclusively linked to by members of one political party. To reach these conclusions, researchers collected nearly half a million Facebook posts (447,684) by members of Congress posted between Jan. 2, 2015, and July 20, 2017. Of those, 177,467 included links to other websites, including a final sample of 42,219 that researchers identified as linking to stories from national news outlets.4 The study also finds that Democratic members of Congress became more likely to share stories from national news outlets once President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Prior to the November 2016 presidential election, 8% of all Facebook posts made by Democrats linked to national news, a proportion that doubled to 16% after Trump’s inauguration. By contrast, the share of congressional Republican posts linking to national news stories remained about the same before and after the inauguration (9% vs. 8%). A May 2017 Pew Research Center survey also found a much larger appetite for national news among Democrats after the election. As Democrats’ appetite for news increased, so did the intensity of their audience’s reactions. In the six months prior to the election, 5% of “reactions” to national news links posted by Democratic members were “angry,” compared with 9% for Republicans. However, in the six months after the election, that number more than tripled to 18% for Democrats, while remaining at 10% for Republicans. When it comes to disseminating news on social media, people who follow members of Congress on Facebook play an important role. A July 2016 survey by Pew Research Center found that 25% of social media users follow political candidates or other political figures online. Other research by the Center suggests that members with the most liberal and conservative legislative voting records have the most Facebook followers. In the current study, researchers examined whether this pattern extended to audience engagement with links to stories from different national news outlets, especially stories from those outlets that were predominantly shared by liberal or conservative legislators. The new analysis finds some evidence that the ways that Facebook audiences interact with congressional posts containing news links may be modestly reinforcing the ideological divide. Specifically, the Facebook audience re-shared news stories from outlets that fell on the most liberal or conservative ends of a “sharing score” 21% to 22% more often than when the link came from a news source that fell in the middle.5 While Facebook comprises one important part of members’ media outreach efforts, members also communicate with their constituents through press releases, town halls, media appearances and on other social media outlets. Although this report does not examine communication across all these channels, Facebook posts are relatively easy to systematically capture and study. Previous research suggests that at least some statements that members of Congress express on Facebook are similar to those they make in press releases. Focusing on Facebook posts also makes it possible to measure how much a member’s audience interacts with the posts by looking at likes, comments and shares. Facebook is also the social media site from which the most Americans get news. To measure the extent to which members of Congress share news links that align with their own ideology, researchers had to identify the ideological leanings of each lawmaker and link that information with the national news outlets that they link to online. To determine each member’s political ideology, researchers used an existing, widely used measure developed by academics called DW-NOMINATE. The ideology measure runs from positive 0.99 (most conservative) to -0.74 (most liberal) across the time period examined in this analysis. For example, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has a score of 0.40, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has a score of -0.49. Across both Congresses included in the study, all Democrats have DW-NOMINATE scores on the liberal side of the scale, and all Republicans have conservative scores. As a next step, rather than attempting to measure the ideology of the national news site itself, researchers looked at the ideology of the members of Congress who shared news links from each outlet. To do this, researchers assigned each member’s DW-NOMINATE ideology score to the news outlets they linked to online, generating a “congressional sharing score” for each news source. This score reflects the average ideological position of all members of Congress who shared stories from each source while accounting for how often the legislator shared them. A news outlet linked to 100 times by Democrats and 10 times by Republicans would have a more liberal score. For example, stories from The New York Times were shared 4,454 times by 429 different members of Congress between January 2015 and July 2017. That number included 228 Democrats and 201 Republicans. To create a congressional sharing score for The New York Times, researchers first identified the ideology scores of all 429 members who shared a link to the site. However, not all members of Congress shared stories from The New York Times at the same rate. Democratic members of Congress who have more liberal scores shared stories from the Times in 3,761 Facebook posts, compared with a total of 693 for Republicans. Congressional sharing scores take this imbalance into account, by counting each individual link to a news story rather than each member of Congress. As a result, the sharing score for The New York Times is -0.28. Because Republicans outnumber Democrats in Congress, the average DW-NOMINATE score across all members is 0.11, not zero. As a result, a news outlet that was shared at the same rate by all members of both parties would have a Congressional Sharing Score of 0.11. Generally speaking, the news outlets that were most often linked to via Facebook fall into three categories: those linked to predominantly by Republicans, those linked to predominantly by Democrats and those that were linked to by members on both sides of the aisle. Researchers defined an outlet as predominantly linked to by those in one party by examining whether more than 75% of links to the outlet came from just Democrats or Republicans. Of the 106 national news outlets in the study – those that appeared in at least 25 posts by members across the study period – 32 outlets were predominantly linked to by Republican lawmakers, 30 by congressional Democrats, and 44 by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. The graph below shows how liberals and conservatives in Congress shared stories from different outlets, focusing only on the news outlets that were linked to most often (200 times or more) over the study period. A narrow boxed range in the graphic indicates the extent to which the outlet was linked to by liberals or conservatives in Congress. For example, Breitbart news was linked to nearly 700 times among Republican lawmakers (particularly more conservative Republicans) during the study period, and zero times by Democrats in Congress. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there were more than 1,100 links to the Huffington Post by congressional Democrats, but only 89 from Republican lawmakers. In contrast, outlets with a very wide boxed range – such as The Washington Post, The Hill and CNN – were linked to often by both liberals and conservatives in Congress. For example, news links to CNN were shared 1,011 times by Democrats in Congress during the study period, and 1,062 by congressional Republicans.  After Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Democrats in Congress became increasingly likely to share national news on Facebook. Between Jan. 2, 2015, and Nov. 8, 2016 – the day of the presidential election – just 8% of congressional Democrats’ Facebook posts included links to national news stories. From Jan. 20 through July 20, 2017, however, that number doubled to 16%. In February 2016, Facebook introduced an array of new “reactions”6 to content in addition to the long-present “like” button, adding to the information on how audiences feel about what they encounter on the platform. The Center analyzed these reactions and found that, in response to posts from congressional Democrats, the proportion of reactions from the Facebook audience that used the “angry” button more than tripled after the election. From May 1 to Nov. 8, 2016, roughly 5% of reactions to national news links posted by congressional Democrats were “angry” reactions – yet between the election and July 20, 2017, fully 18% of all reactions to Democratic lawmakers’ news links were “angry.” Reactions to Republican-shared news links remained relatively stable. Between May 1 and Nov. 8, 2016, 9% of reactions to Republican posts were “angry,” compared with 10% between Nov. 9, 2016 and July 20, 2017. News from outlets whose stories were predominantly shared by more liberal or conservative legislators was somewhat more likely to be re-shared by Facebook users, compared with news from outlets regularly linked to by both liberals and conservatives in Congress. Posts sharing stories from outlets that were linked to almost exclusively by conservative lawmakers – outlets with congressional sharing scores in the top 10% of the scale – had a median of 26 shares. Stories from outlets in the bottom 10% of the scale – that were linked to almost exclusively by very liberal legislators – had a median of 23 shares. In contrast, news outlets regularly linked to by both liberal and conservative lawmakers – with a congressional sharing score in the middle 10% of the scale – had a median of 11 re-shares. To better account for the fact that more liberal and conservative members of Congress have more Facebook followers, researchers estimated regression models to evaluate the relationship between Facebook re-shares and the congressional sharing score of particular outlets. These models account for that fact that some members receive a great deal of Facebook engagement.7 Based on this model, when Democrats or Republicans in Congress shared stories from outlets with the most liberal or conservative sharing scores, respectively, the Facebook audience re-shared those posts 21% and 22% more often than if the stories came from outlets that fell in the middle of the score’s range. On the other hand, when Democratic and Republican legislators shared a story from an outlet that was almost exclusively linked to by members on the other end of the ideological spectrum – instead of linking to an outlet with a sharing score in the middle of the scale – they could expect to receive 17% and 18% fewer re-shares from their Facebook audience, respectively. Overall, these patterns in re-sharing add up to a slightly higher level of engagement from the Facebook audience when members of Congress posted links to news from outlets linked to almost exclusively by liberals or conservatives in Congress.   Link sharing refers to a member of Congress (or members’ staff) including a link as part of a public post on his or her Facebook page. When a member shares a link, his or her Facebook followers may see the link in their newsfeeds. (Note that such sharing does not necessarily involve use of Facebook’s “Share” command; for instance, a member copying the URL of a news article and pasting it into a new Facebook post would constitute sharing.) National news outlets are the websites of U.S.-based news organizations that provide coverage focused on national affairs. News outlets were included only if their stories were shared at least 25 times during the time studied, resulting in a list of 106 outlets. A complete list of the outlets analyzed in this report appears in the Methodology section. DW-NOMINATE is a measure of political ideology that places members of the U.S. House and Senate on a liberal-to-conservative ideology scale according to their roll-call voting history in each legislative session of Congress.8 The scale ranges from -1 (very liberal) to 1 (very conservative) across all Congresses; for the time period studied here, it ranges between -0.74 and 0.99. Congressional sharing scores for each of the 106 national news outlets outlined above capture the average DW-NOMINATE score of members of Congress who link to a story from that outlet in a post on their Facebook page. The scores take into account the number of times members shared stories from each outlet. Overall, the goal is to determine where members who share links to the site fall on the ideological spectrum – whether it is members on the left or the right who more frequently share links to the site, or whether it has a mixed congressional audience. Re-sharing refers to individual Facebook users encountering a link shared by a member of Congress, and then sharing it again with their own Facebook friends. Re-sharing is a form of audience engagement on Facebook.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., is in a Nov. 27 special election runoff with Democrat Mike Espy. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) A top super PAC aligned with President Donald Trump is infusing the Mississippi Senate special election runoff with nearly $300,000 to help Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. Hyde-Smith will face former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy, who also served as Agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, in the Nov. 27 runoff. Neither cleared 50 percent in the Nov. 6 jungle primary, which saw two Republicans and two Democrats run together on the same ballot. America First Action will run radio, television, and digital ads all across the state touting the president’s endorsement of Hyde-Smith and her record of voting in lockstep with his priorities since her April appointment to replace Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired for health reasons. The ad features Trump’s remarks from a rally for Hyde-Smith earlier this year. “Cindy has voted with me 100 percent of the time,” the president says. “She’s always had my back. ... A vote for Cindy is a vote for me and ‘Make America Great Again.’” The spot also highlights Hyde-Smith’s endorsement from the National Rifle Association. America First Action will also contribute resources for a get-out-the-vote phone call operation from Tuesday through the runoff election. Trump himself is scheduled to headline two rallies on Nov. 26, the day before the election, in Tupelo and Biloxi. He will be in Tupelo at 5 p.m. and then in Biloxi three hours later. The special election winner gets to serve out the final two years of Cochran’s term. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the Mississippi special Senate election Solid Republican. Hyde-Smith earned national headlines in recent days after the release of video showing her making controversial remarks. In one, she’s heard saying she’d be “on the front row” if invited by a supporter to a public hanging. In another, she indicated support for making it “just a little more difficult” for liberal college students to vote. Her campaign has called the first remarks “an exaggerated expression of regard” for the supporter and said the latter comments were made in jest. John T. Bennett contributed to this report.

Per White House letter to Acosta on Nov. 19, here are the new rules for press conferences at the White House.pic.twitter.com/a6C2pmLv2K Not much change here. After all, there's long been a discretionary second question at briefings. Sometimes -- many times -- @PressSec grants them, sometimes she does not. How about a rule that Trump actually lets the reporter ask the question completely BEFORE he starts his lying? Or insulting the reporter. Or deflecting. Better yet you get to hold the mic until you get an actual answer to the question. pic.twitter.com/HxQ15Rh4Wa I don’t remember previous administrations feeling the need to lay this out, maybe because they were run by adults The Court required they lay these rules out or else they can't kick out a reporter out of the press conference, since there's no written code of conduct that the reporter is violating. I don't blame the admin, I blame reporters who can't act like professionals. You win for stupidest tweet of the day. As a real lawyer. These new instructions allow immense discretion and are not due process. This is one more attack on the 1st Amendment by those who start with the Second. Attack the messenger not message. I'm certainly no lawyer. So these rules fail to adopt neutral standards of behavior that if violated would justify revocation, because they are too vague? The WH needs to make more in-depth rules for them to survive the inevitable court challenge? Void for vagueness. I like how the rules don’t include answering questions. (truthfully) Let's not kid ourselves, they never included that. Rules for children except the only child in the room is Donald Trump. He needs to go. Basically the existing rules which have always been in place but now lose your credentials if they decide you've violated any of them. That is NOT due process. That is star chamber justice. Agreed, why can't Trump be like Obama?! Simply indict Acosta as a co-conspirator and tap the phones of his relatives! What? Obama WAS better, right? And he absolutely did that to Rosen... no question. So clearly that would be preferable. Because rudeness is the same thing as a criminal code violation. Chopping a young female intern's are while she's trying to do her job is not rudeness... it's assault. Don't believe me? Ask a real lawyer... Chopping. lol. Watch another doctored video.

Hannity — who was widely criticized earlier this week for campaigning on stage with President Donald Trump — called Acosta “a self-serving liberal hack with zero journalistic integrity” who “deserves to be banned” from White House press briefings. The White House revoked Acosta’s press credentials Wednesday following a fiery news conference exchange with Trump in which an intern attempted to seize the microphone from him. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later shared a doctored video clip that made it appear that Acosta had assaulted the intern. Hannity, who has repeatedly been called out for boosting Trump, was unabashed, however. “He’s unprofessional, it’s outrageous, it’s insulting,” he said of Acosta. “He’s supposed to be a journalist? That’s a charade. You do a disservice to real journalists in the press corps.” Check out the clip here:

---split---3.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/chuck-grassley-will-step-into-tax-storm-finance-gavel-in-hand---split---Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, conducts a Senate Judiciary Committee markup in October. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Sen. Charles E. Grassley is expected to be the next chairman of the Finance Committee, putting the Iowa Republican at the center of the storm in the 116th Congress on what could be divisive debates over tax, trade and health care policy. Grassley cited a sense of “optimism” fueled by the “pro-growth” policies of a Republican president and Congress. “Looking ahead. ... I want to continue to work to make sure that as many Americans as possible get to experience this good economy for themselves,” he said in a statement released Friday. “That means working to provide Americans with additional tax relief and tax fairness so they can spend more of their hard-earned money on what’s important to them.” The announcement that he’ll grab the Finance gavel despite being eligible to serve two more years as Judiciary chairman sets the stage for Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a rival-turned-ally of President Donald Trump, to take that post based on seniority. Grassley added that he wants to work on “expanding market opportunities for farmers, manufacturers and service providers,” and on “improving the affordability, quality and accessibility of health care, including in rural America.” The Finance chairmanship is open since Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah did not seek re-election. Grassley previously held the Finance gavel during the early part of 2001, before then-Sen. James Jeffords left the GOP and handed the Senate majority to the Democrats, and again from 2003 through 2006 when Republicans were in the majority. He was also ranking member until Hatch took over in 2011, when the two Republicans switched places at Finance and Judiciary. Under Senate Republican rules, Grassley still has two more years at Finance, in part because his brief 2001 stint as chairman won’t count. Grassley was a key player on a number of big-ticket measures during his previous tenure as Finance chairman, including the 2001 and 2003 Bush-era tax cuts; enactment of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit in 2003; and passage of several free trade accords including with the Dominican Republic and five Central American nations, as well as with Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman and Jordan. During his time as ranking member, Grassley worked for months on a bipartisan health care overhaul measure with then-Finance Chairman Max Baucus, before the two parties gave up in frustration and the Democratic leadership and Obama administration pursued an ultimately successful strategy to pass the measure with only Democratic votes. Grassley will have his hands full next year as lawmakers try to navigate a divided government and tackle issues like implementing legislation for the revised North American free trade pact negotiated by the Trump administration; clarifications to the 2017 tax code overhaul sought by retailers, multinationals and others; and the ongoing drama over health care costs and stability of the insurance exchanges set up under the 2010 health care law. President Donald Trump also wants Congress to enact a 10 percent tax cut for middle class — and he’s expressed openness to funding it with higher taxes on wealthy households and corporations. First on the slate, unless it is passed during the lame-duck session, will be a technical corrections package to fix issues with the tax code law. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said earlier this week that a technical corrections bill was forthcoming and that it would correct between 70 and 80 problems with the tax code overhaul. Lawmakers also need to figure out what to do with about 26 expired tax breaks that are important to various groups ranging from homeowners to biodiesel producers. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed interest in providing additional incentives both for individuals to save for retirement and for employers to make it easier for workers to do so. Another topic on next year’s agenda that will require Finance Committee involvement is a possible infrastructure spending package. “There’s always more that can be done to help make life better for and empower every individual and family,” Grassley said. “I look forward to working with other senators, both Republican and Democratic, to get the job done.” Grassley’s fellow Finance Republicans still need to formally elect him to the chairmanship in January, and their decision would then be subject to ratification by the full Senate Republican Conference.

Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan. | Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Defense By WESLEY MORGAN 11/19/2018 04:15 PM EST Updated 11/19/2018 05:36 PM EST The 5,800 troops who were rushed to the southwest border amid President Donald Trump’s pre-election warnings about a refugee caravan will start coming home as early as this week — just as some of those migrants are beginning to arrive. Democrats and Republicans have criticized the deployment as a ploy by the president to use active-duty military forces as a prop to try to stem Republican losses in this month’s midterm elections. Story Continued Below The general overseeing the deployment told POLITICO on Monday that the first troops will start heading home in the coming days as some are already unneeded, having completed the missions for which they were sent. The returning service members include engineering and logistics units whose jobs included placing concertina wire and other barriers to limit access to ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border. All the troops should be home by Christmas, as originally expected, Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan said in an interview Monday. "Our end date right now is 15 December, and I've got no indications from anybody that we'll go beyond that," said Buchanan, who leads the land forces of U.S. Northern Command.

In previous cases in which the military deployed to beef up security at the border, the forces consisted of part-time National Guard troops under the command of state governors who backed up U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other law enforcement agencies. But the newly deployed troops, most of them unarmed and from support units, come from the active-duty military, a concession the Pentagon made after Trump insisted that the deployment include "not just the National Guard." Buchanan confirmed previous reports that the military had rejected a request from the Department of Homeland Security for an armed force to back up Border Patrol agents in the event of a violent confrontation. "That is a law enforcement task, and the secretary of Defense does not have the authority to approve that inside the homeland," Buchanan said. The closure earlier Monday of one entry point along the California border near Tijuana, Mexico, was only partial and did not require more drastic measures, Buchanan said. "About half of the lanes were closed this morning, but that’s it," he reported. "No complete closures." Other ports might be closed fully in the future, he said, but he did not anticipate any need to take more drastic measures. "If CBP have reliable information that one of their ports is about to get rushed with a mob, or something like that that could put their agents at risk, they could ask us to completely close the port," Buchanan said. "You understand the importance of commerce at these ports. Nobody in CBP wants to close a port unless they’re actually driven to do so." The troop deployment should start trailing off as engineer and other logistics troops wind down their mission of building base camps and fortifying ports of entry for the Border Patrol. Congress By KYLE CHENEY Army and Marine engineers have now emplaced about 75 percent of the obstacles they planned to, including concertina wire, shipping containers, and concrete barriers at ports of entry. “Once we get the rest of the obstacles built, we don’t need to keep all those engineers here. As soon as I’m done with a capability, what I intend to do is redeploy it,” Buchanan said. “I don’t want to keep these guys on just to keep them on.” Logistics troops, too, will be among the first to head home. “I will probably ask to start redeploying some of our logistic capability,” Buchanan predicted. “Now that things are set down here, we don’t need as many troops to actually build base camps and things like that, because the base camps are built." Among the troops who will remain after construction engineers and logisticians start departing are helicopter pilots, planners, medical personnel, and smaller “quick response” teams of engineers who can help Border Patrol personnel shut down traffic at their ports of entry. In contrast to the speed of the deployment in early November and the fanfare surrounding it, the withdrawal promises to be slower and quieter — but Buchanan expects it to be done before Christmas. “That doesn’t mean it’s impossible,” he added. “But right now, this is a temporary mission, and we’re tasked to do it until the 15th of December.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

---split---3.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/battle-house-hits-shores-southern-california---split---Will a blue wave hit California? Democrat Harley Rouda is one of the candidates hoping to flip a GOP-held seat. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) LAGUNA WOODS, Calif. — The battle for control of the House has landed in California, and it’s partly because of voters like Deborah and Wyatt Carr. Deborah, 69, was not registered with a party, and Wyatt, 73, was a longtime Republican. Both voted for Hillary Clinton and for their GOP congresswoman, Mimi Walters, in 2016. But on a recent Saturday here, the Carrs were sporting bright orange T-shirts to show support for one of Walters’ challengers: Democrat Katie Porter. The Republican Party has moved away from them on issues such as immigration and gun control, they said, and Walters has not done enough to stand up to President Donald Trump or for their 45th District. The question for both parties is how many more voters like Deborah and Wyatt exist in the traditionally Republican stronghold of Orange County. Democrats see new opportunities to flip Southern California House seats, but Republicans say it won’t be that easy. California operatives say there has been more focus on House races in Orange County this cycle than at any other time they can remember. For the first time, both parties’ House campaign committees have offices in the county. And they’re in the same city. Across the highway from John Wayne Airport in Irvine, the National Republican Congressional Committee leased 10,000 square feet of office space. Inside, campaign signs for local GOP members of Congress hang on the walls, and red tablecloths cover the phone bank stations (along with some pocket Constitutions). On an average weekday, between 15 and 20 volunteers hit the phones, focusing on boosting GOP turnout ahead of the June 5 primary. The space is also shared with Walters’ campaign and will host events and serve as a central location for GOP campaigns and NRCC staffers. “This is a long-term commitment,” NRCC spokesman Jesse Hunt said. “Part of it … is taking roots in Orange County and making sure that this bastion of Republicanism [in Southern California], if you will, knows that we’re committed, knows that Republican campaigns, organizations are committed to maintaining our advantage in this area.” Those trying to erode that advantage are also based in Irvine, in a WeWork shared office space, just a 15-minute drive up Interstate 405 from the NRCC office. Staffers with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have been working for a year on the fourth floor. They have eight full-time staffers, including a political director, and have invested in field organizers in seven GOP-held districts in California that Clinton carried. “In my political life, I’ve never seen four Orange County congressional districts in play, at least targeted by the Democrats like this,” said Matt Cunningham, a GOP strategist in California. He’s working with Republican Scott Baugh, who is challenging Republican incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the 48th District. While the Democratic energy has led to a glut of congressional hopefuls, it has endangered their chances of making the general election ballot. Under California’s top-two primary system, the two highest vote-getters on Tuesday, regardless of party, will advance to November. Democrats are concerned having a slew of candidates could split the vote, leaving two Republicans to fight it out in the fall. The DCCC, the state Democratic Party and members of Congress were active in encouraging some candidates to drop out, and are now focused on turning out voters for the primary. They see California as key to taking back the House, given the sheer number of GOP-held districts that backed Clinton. Democrats on the ground say the area was shifting years before the 2016 election. “One thing to remember about this district is it’s a very diverse district, a very young district,” said Sam Jammal, a Democrat running for the open 39th District, where GOP incumbent Ed Royce is not seeking re-election. “It didn’t suddenly become very diverse and young as soon as Donald Trump got elected.” Four of the seven GOP-held districts that backed Clinton in California touch Orange County, long considered a Republican stronghold. Clinton sent shockwaves though the area when she carried the county in 2016 — the first Democratic presidential nominee to do so since 1936. “There was a time when Orange County was behind the orange curtain,” said Andrew Acosta, a California Democratic consultant. “You couldn’t get a Democrat elected down there. … So now there’s a lot more optimism for Democrats to be successful.” Democrats are heavily targeting two open seats held by retiring Republicans — the 39th and 49th districts. They’re also targeting Walters in the 45th District and Rohrabacher in the 48th. Ask people in Orange County what has changed, and they’ll point to the demographic shifts and increasing Hispanic and Asian populations. On a recent Saturday in the 39th District, Democrats gathered in Rowland Heights to encourage voters to turn out in the primary. At a school a few blocks away from the event, a banner about soccer teams displayed three different languages. The 39th is a majority-minority district that Clinton carried by 9 points, and Royce won by 14 points in 2016. Recognizing that his district was changing, Royce has reached out to its different communities, particularly Asian-Americans, who make up 32 percent of the population. But with the 13-term congressman retiring, Democrats see the 39th as a top pickup opportunity, as long as a Democrat makes it out of Tuesday’s crowded primary. The other Orange County districts are also increasingly diverse. Democrats see another reason for optimism about flipping these seats. They say GOP policies in the nation’s capital, such as the tax overhaul and expanding offshore drilling, are negatively affecting the area. “In 2016, we saw that Democrats can appeal to a diverse electorate,” said DCCC spokesman Drew Godinich, who is based in Irvine. “What we also have working in our favor this cycle is how the Republican agenda in Washington has almost specifically targeted Southern California for punishment.” Republicans disagree, saying voters will reap the benefits of the new tax law. They also argue Democratic candidates are moving too far to the left in the crowded primaries. “I feel pretty good about most of our incumbents,” California GOP chairman Jim Brulte said. “The fact of the matter is Democrats … in order to win their primary, are posturing to the left of Elizabeth Warren. And this is not where most California, Southern California, Central California, down-the-line voters are.” Republicans are also turning out their voters, GOP lawmakers and operatives say. In all but one of the four Orange County seats targeted by Democrats, Republicans outnumber Democrats in returned ballots, according to numbers from Political Data Inc. The exception was the open 49th District, where Democratic turnout had equaled the GOP side as of Friday evening. And Republicans believe their voters will turn out to support an initiative undoing an increase in the state’s gas tax that is expected to be on the ballot in November. Some pushed back on the notion that the districts’ increasing diversity meant they would become more Democratic. “It’s always talked about as the sleeping giant,” Cunningham said of Hispanic voters. “Part of the issue is [Democrats] have a hard time converting young voters or minority voters into actual voters.” That is reflected so far in absentee returns, where white voters dominate ballots returned in all four of the targeted seats. Voters between the ages of 65 and 74 also have the highest rate of ballots returned in all four districts. Young Kim, a top GOP candidate in the 39th District, agreed the area was becoming more diverse, but said she believed the districts were actually shifting to the middle, with more voters registering as “no party preference” voters. (Republicans have seen a statewide decline in voter registration. Last week, no party preference voters surpassed Republicans in registration.) Republicans still have to work to appeal to the changing communities, some said. “For too long Democrats have done a better job of getting out into the community and shaking hands and connecting with the community,” Kim said. “But I think that is changing.” Royce serves as an example to Republicans looking to adjust to shifting demographics, said Kim, who has the incumbent’s support in the race and was his longtime district staffer. Kim is known in the community — she served a term in the state Assembly. That sort of familiarity is an advantage other Republican candidates in the area share, said GOP state Sen. John Moorlach, who has been active in Orange County politics for more than two decades. Democratic hopefuls are generally first-time candidates. “You got all these Democratic unknowns running against Republican knowns,” Moorlach said. “And I don’t know how you beat somebody with a nobody.” Some Democrats acknowledge that winning these districts will be a challenge even though Clinton carried them. “I think these seats can flip and they should flip, but the candidates matter so, so, so much more,” Jammal said. “These are educated districts that haven’t elected Democrats in the past, so we actually have to make a case,” he added. “It’s not going to be a situation where, ‘Oh, OK, we hate Donald Trump and we’re going to elect Democrats.’ We actually have to sell it.” One California Democratic consultant in the state put it a different way: If Democrats bank on increased turnout that might not happen, they could get burned. “If you’re waiting for the wave on your surfboard for six hours and the wave never comes, that’s a long day in the sun,” the consultant said.

---split---3.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-pardon-turkey-a-look-at-the-white-houses-thanksgiving-tradition---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. President Donald Trump officially pardons a turkey named Drumstick. Watch his ceremony and other viral turkey pardoning moments in history. It’s a big day to be a tom. President Trump will use his presidential pardoning power to grant mercy to one lucky bird at the White House Tuesday. A fairly new tradition, the event spares one turkey from dinner just two days before Thanksgiving, the biggest turkey-eating holiday all year. The White House has created a Twitter poll for fans to vote for the lucky bird. Although there’s much speculation over just who was the first president to actually pardon the poultry, experts – including the National Turkey Federation (NFT) – credit former President George H.W. Bush for starting the official tradition. “The formalities of pardoning a turkey jelled by 1989, when George H. W. Bush, with animal rights activists picketing nearby, quipped, ‘But let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy – he's granted a presidential pardon as of right now – and allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here,’” the White House Historical Society says. The custom of sending turkeys to the White House is an old one – dating back to the 1870s when “poultry king” Horace Vose would send his birds – but many former leaders of the free world actually ate the turkeys instead of setting them free. However, some presidents, including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, did spare a few fowls in their day. Former President Harry S. Truman was the first president to receive a turkey from the National Turkey Federation in 1947. (White House archives) Harry S. Truman, too, was rumored to have saved a few birds in his day, although his presidential library dispelled those claims. Those rumors most likely stem from Truman being the first president to be presented with a turkey by the NFT in 1947. The annual event has been a tradition ever since – although it’s not clear what the fate was for every turkey presented. The NFT’s chairman is elected every February, but official preparations for the annual pardoning begin around July or August, Kimmon Williams, the public relations manager for the federation, told Fox News in a 2017 interview. This year’s pair – Peas and Carrots – were raised on a farm in South Dakota by NTF Chairman Jeff Sveen and turkey grower Ruben Waldner, according to the White House. The Presidential Flock are usually toms – males – because of their traditional appearance, strut and gobbling sounds, according to Williams. The pair is picked based on their characteristics, personality and interactions with people, she said. The Presidential Flock doesn’t arrive in Washington, D.C. without a little training first. They are “acclimated from an early age to the unique experiences of the ceremony: television lights and crowded noises,” according to the NFT. Williams said the turkeys, too, will take a tour around their home state ahead of their trip to the nation’s capital, where they will meet with children. This gives the turkeys more of a chance to interact with crowds and unusual noises, and kids an opportunity to experience farm culture. Two turkeys from South Dakota, Peas and Carrots, get comfortable in their room at the Willard InterContinental Hotel, after their arrival Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Washington. The turkeys will be pardoned by President Trump during a ceremony at the White House ahead of Thanksgiving. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Ahead of the pardoning, the two turkeys live large. The turkeys are put up in the Willard InterContinental Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. – a swanky hotel near the White House. Peas and Carrots will check out of their accommodations on Tuesday. Don’t worry, taxpayers: the NFT said it covers the cost of the hotel stay. After the pardoning, both turkeys will go to Virginia Tech’s “Gobbler’s Rest” where they will be cared for by students and veterinarians. Other birds have been sent to farms and zoos. The public is welcome to visit Peas and Carrots in Blacksburg, Va., but not for long. With luck, the Presidential Flock might live another year or more. A few of their predecessors have hit the ripe old age of 2, but very few domestic turkeys live that long. The vast majority get sent to processing plants when they're between 14 to 20 weeks old.

---split---3.0---split---https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/11/19/new-orleans-saints-drew-brees-sean-payton-fmia-nfl-week-11-peter-king/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text---split---NEW ORLEANS — “This is the first time in NFL history a play like this has been run from this formation! Ever!” jovial Saints coach Sean Payton called out to his offensive team Saturday night in a second-floor ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton on Canal Street. This was a man in love with his job. The NFL’s state-of-the-art offense was doing a final walk-through in the Salon II ballroom before facing the Eagles on Sunday in the Superdome. (New Orleans embarrassed Philadelphia, 48-7, the worst loss ever by a defending Super Bowl champion.) Quite a sight, as the players lined up and walked/slow-jogged through the first 15 plays they planned to run. Alvin Kamara, wearing flip-flops, black socks and a red hoodie obscuring much of his face. Brees, in shorts, untied sneakers and a black T-shirt pumping his FNA co-ed flag football league. Payton, in a blue pullover, playing defense. Payton called out the name of Sunday’s bizarre play: “Q stop, G snug. Right empty. QB 38 Z Crush Alley.” On cue, Brees joined two wideouts to the left in a bunch formation (three receivers, snug to each other), while jack-of-all-trades-quarterback Taysom Hill joined the same type of bunch formation to the right. Damndest thing I ever saw: Five linemen up front. Three receivers left, three receivers right. No quarterback. As instructed, Brees trailed two bigger wideouts on the left side of the formation. The coaches lined up as Eagle defensive players. “I got Drew!” Payton said, crouching a bit across from the left bunch, like a press corner. “And don’t screw up the cadence, Taysom!” The 11 offensive guys got set, and at the last minute, Hill motioned left to a shotgun position and called out the signals. Center Max Unger snapped it to him, and Hill powered right in a slow jog behind a slew of blockers. The play would be a power run, and it would fit into exactly what Payton told his players in this meeting: “Our emphasis in this game is to run at 22 [cornerback Sidney Jones]. He’s coming off a hamstring, and we don’t think he can hold up.” No fooling around. All business, even on this weird play. Strange seeing football players practice at 30-percent speed in hoodies and jeans and whatever, with coaches playing Fletcher Cox and Malcolm Jenkins. After 15 minutes, each play run the same way, Payton said, “Let’s break it down,” and they gathered in a circle, said something I couldn’t understand, and the players went to team snack. (More than a snack, actually; it was a full-blown buffet meal.) In the wide hallway outside Salon II, I asked Payton: “How’d you think of the double-bunch play?” “Thursday night,” Payton said. “Just doodling. Just thinking. I just thought of it, and I said to the coaches, ‘Will this work?’ And [quarterbacks coach] Joe Lombardi said, ‘Why not? We can do anything we want.’ When I told Troy Aikman about it [in the FOX production meeting], he said, ‘Who’s getting the snap?’ I said, ‘No one. Yet.’ “ Payton thought for a minute, giving a John Nash look into the distance. “Part of it, really, is thinking of something that they [the Eagles] haven’t seen. That’s the job of a game-planner. You want eight heads to turn to [smart Eagles veteran safety] Malcolm Jenkins and be like, ‘What do we do?’ “ Payton took my notebook and drew out the formation. He said sometime later in the game, they’d reverse the call. It’d be Brees who’d go behind center at the last second and take a snap. Only this time it wouldn’t be a power run. Brees would throw it—maybe a quick stop route to the left, or a post from a receiver in the right bunch. By that time, the players had all relocated to the ballroom with the food. Except for one player. That player was playing a grand piano—and playing it very, very well. We looked over, and I asked Payton who it was. “Austin Carr,” Payton said. “Wide receiver. President of his class at Northwestern. He’ll be the president of the United States when he retires.” Carr played for a while, beautifully. I went over to ask him about playing. “Just relieving some tension,” said Carr, talking while his fingers moved over the keys. He said he loves the music of John Legend. This music is what you’d hear from someone coming out of Juilliard. “The song’s beautiful,” I said. “What’s it called?” “I haven’t named it yet,” he said. Lots of composers in this Saints group. Intermission: This is not the usual Football Morning in America column. Last week, I asked Sean Payton if one weekend this year I could write about his Saturday night meeting, and about the relationship between he and Drew Brees, who is having the greatest year of his life (and one of the greatest years a quarterback’s ever had, regardless of age) at age 39. Payton agreed, and so Saturday night around 7, Payton’s assistant, Kevin Petry, took me onto the second floor of the Ritz-Carlton for the Saints meetings, which ran from 8 (Payton actually kicked it off at 7:59) till about 10:40. This is the story of that evening. I will get to the news of the day, just perhaps not in the depth that you’re accustomed because so much of my energy this weekend was devoted to something you’re not going to be able to read anywhere else. I should tell you that the coaches seemed to get a kick out of an interloper among them. The evening began with the coaching staff in a smaller room, the LaSalle Room, at the end of the hall, with 17 men sitting around a large U-shaped table with a white screen at the top of the “U.” I sat in back behind the table, next to the side wall. “You’re embedded in here tonight, right?” Payton said, looking at me. “That the right word, Peter? That’s what they used to have in wars, right? Don’t see that anymore.” Lombardi piped up: “Not quite the same hardship here at the Ritz.” This is what I learned about the best offense in this offensively explosive period of football: It’s a more democratic group than I thought. This isn’t an autocratic Payton dictating plays. Drew Brees has a ton of input in plays he wants to run. Brees’ historically accurate season (he’s a 67-percent career passer, completing 77 percent this year) has a lot to do with his symbiotic relationship with Payton, and with both of them knowing what works best for an offense that’s quite complex. But it’s an offense they’ve nurtured and expanded since both came to the Saints in 2006. As Carr told me: “I can attest to the democratic process here. There’s an ethos of leaving your ego at the door. Lots of teams say that, but you don’t always see it. Sean’s OK when Drew says, ‘I don’t want to do that,’ and same with Drew about Sean. They’ve found the sweet spot in dealing with each other.” I saw that in the final meeting of the night. More about that later. First, let me explain what the night is like. It has six segments: a short all-coaches meeting, maybe 10 minutes; a 20-minute discussion about the first 15 plays Payton intends to call; a very short (maybe five to 10 minutes) all-team meeting, with a message mainly from Payton; the walk-through with the offense; the all-team snack (and, on this night, piano-playing); and finally, a meeting of about 40 minutes with Brees telling Payton, offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael and Lombardi what he likes and doesn’t like in the game plan. The all-coaches meeting has a discussion of injuries and who will be active and inactive, and a message from Payton. Two things tonight: “We gotta run right at 22 [Jones] and we gotta throw at 22. We’re gonna make him defend the run on the first play. We’re going after him on three of the first eight plays.” And then, a bit of a surprise. “We want to put the game on [Eagles quarterback Carson] Wentz,” Payton said. Payton likes Wentz as a player, but his player-personnel analyst, Ryan Herman, gives him trends and numbers every week, and Payton tells the group two interesting ones about Wentz, from Herman: The Eagles are 1-11 when Wentz plays and they allow more than 26 points. And he’s 0-9 when he passes for between 308 and 364 yards, the point being if he does that, the Eagles likely won’t be running the ball well, and the Saints feel they can beat a one-dimensional offense. Then the defensive coaches left to work on their own, and the offensive coaches work on the opening plays. On the screen, Payton’s opening plays come up … and the double-bunch is number five. Clearly, it’s going to be called early in the game. Payton wants to see the big-bodied Hill steaming around right end at number 22. (He never calls him “Sidney Jones.” Just “22.”) For a stranger who doesn’t know the Saints’ vernacular, listening to the discussion of each play is like listening to Dutch. One of the reasons Payton isn’t paranoid about me sitting in, I’m sure, is that when I hear, “Snug left, Y fly, P 35 Stab dog F rail,” I’m not going to know what it means—and that’s just the way they like it. “Ball security in this game is everything,” Payton said. “They’ve got a great front. They’ll come after us. They have to win this game. Let’s go win another one. “Because it’s the next one.” Then the short team meeting with the message, again, about 22. Then the defensive players leave to move next door to have their own meeting. Then everyone in the room, coaches and offensive players, pick up the conference-room chairs and stack them by either side of the room, to make room for the walk-through. This walk-through is a test, to see if every player can remember his job on every play (and for 15 straight plays, there are no mental errors, only the warning from Payton to Hill about his cadence). One interesting thing: Players are drilled in the precision of spacing, and who is on the line and who is off a step. So several times, Michael Thomas lined up wide left, on the line, and almost reflexively waved his hand to the receiver to his left, as if to say, ‘Get a step back.’ One of the coaches told me the receivers take care of each other like that. Then the snack. In the big room with stations scattered throughout, Payton gets spaghetti and explains the week and the importance of continuing to mine information. “This year, because of Taysom’s development, we talk a lot during the week about how to use Taysom,’’ he said, digging into what for him is dinner, not a snack. “But we meet late most nights during the week. I want to go over everything. I want to see it, write it, feel it, discuss it. Last night, I put on the Football Life with Mike Holmgren. He used to be a third-grade teacher, and I think that’s great training for what we do. We gotta put a plan together with who is in the building—not with who we wish was in the building. We gotta evolve with who we have.” R and D is big in the job. “I look at the league a lot,” Payton said. “I look at all the scoring plays every week. I look at [Bill] Belichick and New England. I look at Sean McVay. I found a good one last night. I hadn’t watched all of New England’s offensive plays in the Super Bowl against Philadelphia in a while, and so last night, I put the tape on and I found something. Gronk [tight end Rob Gronkowski] caught a ball inside the 10 and scored, but it’s how he caught it. It was like catching an inbounds pass, using your body to keep the defender off you. That’s perfect for us. I told Mike Thomas, ‘This is a touchdown.’ We practiced it today. I think we’ll use it.” By 9:55, Brees and his coaches sit back in LaSalle, and now it’s Brees’ turn to weigh in on the game plan. Payton has approximately 18 sections of the game plan: play-action, screens, quarterback-movement plays, empty-backfield, two-minute, and more. All the men in the room have a copy of the play sheet. Payton asks Brees, for instance, “Red zone, 20 to the 11, what do you got?” In other words, “What do you want me to call?” To each section, Brees said between one and six plays. In this section, for instance, he said six plays. Payton, using a black Sharpie, placed a dot on each play Brees liked and wanted called. And it was the way Brees said the plays. Deliberately, with reasoning when need be. Like: “22 paint Y shock, X Harvey.” Four or five seconds to look at the next play and envision it. Then onto the others. “52 Z Hank.” And more. In the tight Red Zone category (5-yard line to the 3) Payton asked Brees, “How are you with Bloodhound 21?” Good, Brees said. Payton liked this—it was a way to take advantage of a young and inexperienced secondary, calling the play quickly and using fast tempo to rush to the line while the defense might be swimming. At 10:37, Brees was done with his recommendations. There’d been, by my count, 46 of them. One would pay dividends early in Sunday’s game. After the meeting, Payton and Brees sat with me to discuss imagination and their bond. “The evolution from where we were, call it 13 years ago, when we all first got here in ’06 to now, is pretty amazing” Brees said. “It’s an exciting process. It’s a bit nerve-wracking early in the week I think because you’re sitting there watching film after film and you’re trying to identify all the ways that you can attack that defense, right? I think some of our best ideas at times come on a Saturday or Saturday night, or even Sunday morning.” Said Payton: “This week, it started with me drawing it on the board saying, what if we just lined up with no quarterback and one of the two of them came back depending on the play. Part of the install sometimes is to have some fun and have some levity with something like that. The first day we’re doing it in walk through. Max [Unger, the center] turns around. There’s no one to snap to. Drew and Taysom are kinda looking at each other like, is it me? Or is it you? And— Brees interrupted: “Rock, paper, scissors.” There’s Brees, finishing Payton’s sentence. Gameday. All I can think of waiting for this to kick off is I hope this poor Sidney Jones doesn’t get steamrolled. How the story lines from Saturday night played out on Sunday afternoon: • 22 lasted 22 plays. Jones went out with a hamstring injury again. When he was in, he wasn’t good. On the first snap of the game, as promised, Mark Ingram, with a 35-pound edge on Jones, headed through the right side of the line right at Jones. Ingram blew through an arm tackle and rumbled for 38 yards. Saints settled for a field goal. • The no-QB offense. Five plays after Ingram’s run, here it came: the double bunch. For four seconds, no quarterback. It wasn’t eight Eagles who turned around, confused, wondering what to do. There were three, including Jenkins. No matter. The ballyhooed-inside-the-Saints play busted when Taysom Hill didn’t take a wide-enough rush outside. Stalled in traffic. Gain of one. • Bloodhound 21. Boy, did this one work. It became the first NFL touchdown of Carr’s life, and the 510th of Brees’ career. On the Saints’ second drive, Brees rushed the team to the line, all Eagles weren’t totally ready, and, from three yards out, Carr nestled between two Eagle defenders and Brees lasered one to him. Drew Brees finds Austin Carr for his first career NFL touchdown! #PHIvsNO pic.twitter.com/FBbcasfHZj — New Orleans Saints (@Saints) November 18, 2018  • Gronk. Thomas’ first catch of the day was a classic Gronk box-out, pivoting to turn his body away from the defensive back while bodying up the defender on a 30-yard gain. In the third quarter, Brees called the play, and it might have worked … except for a defensive holding call that put the ball at the Eagle 1. Ingram ran it in from there. • Adjusting on the fly. “I’ve never seen the Eagles play as much man,” Payton said after the game. With significant doubling of Alvin Kamara and Thomas, Brees had to go to his four least-experienced pass-catchers more than he’s planned. Four receivers—Carr, Tre’quan Smith, Dan Arnold and Keith Kirkwood, who entered the game with 25 NFL catches combined—caught 16 passes for 218 yards and two touchdowns. I told Payton the combined numbers after the game, and he cackled in glee. “Sean loves that because he’s such a football nerd,” Carr said. “He’s the football equivalent of a coder.” Moral of the Week 11 story in New Orleans: You don’t know when a play’s going to work and when it’s going to bust. Payton will drag out the No-QB look again, and he’ll think of something else weird in time for the Thursday-nighter against Atlanta (8:20 p.m. on NBC and the NBC Sports app). We’re living in fun times, with coaches like Doug Pederson and Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan and Matt Nagy and Andy Reid who wake up most mornings wondering what’s new under the sun. By the time the sun sets, they’ve usually found something. “The ideas can be good, but they have to include a Kamara or a Tyreek Hill,” Payton said. Maybe, but this New Orleans team just beat the Super Bowl champs by 41 with four NFL neophytes contributing 218 yards and two touchdowns. That’s the genius of Brees’ game, helped by the Payton’s imagination. The football equivalent of a coder. This is a great time to be alive and to be an NFL fan if you love offense, because there’s such a surplus of greatness in the league. But what I love about this league right now was on display Saturday night in some meeting rooms on Canal Street in the French Quarter. Payton wants something new, and he wants it now, and when he finds it, he can be pretty sure Brees is going to execute it like he has Payton’s brain in his head. Which he nearly does. When we last left Indianapolis, in the middle of October, it was already wait-till-next-year time in Indiana. The Colts were 1-5, they’d just given up 42 points to the abysmal Jets, the rest of the year was going to be target practice for Andrew Luck so he (and the franchise) could feel better about 2019. But they’ve won four straight (by an average of 19.3 points), and they totally undressed one of the league’s hot teams, Tennessee, 38-10 Sunday in Indy. In the last four games, the Colts are scoring 36.5 points a game (only the Saints have been more explosive over that time), and Luck, a punching bag when he last played in 2016, has not been sacked. The turn of events has been so stunning that Reich, when this rout was over Sunday, walked into his office at Lucas Oil Stadium, closed the door, sat quietly and found himself near tears. This is why: A year ago, Reich, then 56, was the offensive coordinator in Philadelphia and thought there was a good chance that his dream of being an NFL head coach would never happen. When all the head-coaching jobs for 2018 got scarfed up by the middle of January, Reich thought he’d have to wait (at least) another year. But then the Eagles went on their Super Bowl run, Josh McDaniels told the Colts he was staying in New England two days after the Super Bowl, Reich got interviewed, and Indianapolis chose him as coach. And wouldn’t you be emotional if circumstances finally turned in your favor and you got the job of your dreams, and you had a franchise quarterback playing like one? That’s why Reich was overcome Sunday. “Sitting there,” he told me from Indianapolis after the game, “I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I was so emotional. I really connect with this place and these people and this quarterback, and I just thought how great it was that it worked out that I’m here.” Luck’s a 67-percent passer under Reich, with seven straight games of at least three touchdown throws. Something Reich learned from Doug Pederson in Philadelphia last year is to run a democratic process—to listen to your coaches and to your quarterback about what works best. Collaborating with Luck has been easy. “He’s got a level of tenacity in every part of his preparation that’s special,” Reich said. Also, it’s pretty important to run for 200 yards a game, which the Colts have done three straight weeks now. One of the things Reich has stressed with his team is the ethos of incremental gains. Some call that getting one percent better every day. That’s a Reich mantra. Winning games makes players believe in that. Getting to 5-5 makes them believe they’re progressing. As did this piece of imagery he created for his team after the game: “I told them we’ve climbed out of the deep hole, but now we’ve got a mountain to climb. We got a long way to go.” At least now the Colts can see where they’re going. Normally, the 9-1 Chiefs at the 9-1 Rams would be the game of the year—it probably still is—and we’d be celebrating it breathlessly. And we still may, in the hours before the game; I’ll help in a moment. But two things have overshadowed it. Moving the game out of Mexico City makes the NFL look like a bunch of slightly progressive pikers. “Pikers” because how can the league take a game that we’ve all known would be hugely attractive since it was announced on Jan. 31—two defending division champs with brainy offensive minds—and not properly supervise field conditions in the weeks leading up to the game 10 months later? It’s inexcusable. If the field was in trouble a month ago, which apparently it was, why didn’t the NFL throw its weight around then and insist on a new surface or tell officials there the game wouldn’t stay in Mexico? “Slightly progressive” because they did the right thing after all and moved the game instead of trying to force the players to play there—which, I am told by a player leader from one of the teams, they would not have done. And what a scene that would have been, players boycotting the Game of the Year. The Rams are playing for a wide swath of southern California. They will remember tonight the families of those murdered in the Nov. 7 massacre at the nightclub four miles from their facility in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and for the police officer murdered in that tragedy, and also the first responders and those impacted by the fires that got as close to three miles from their facility and forced 90 Rams employees and family to evacuate their homes. Tonight, coaches and staff from both teams, instead of wearing Rams and Chiefs hats on the sidelines, will wear hats from local fire and rescue departments; all jerseys from the game, plus the hats, will be auctioned off to raise money for the victims. ESPN will show the anthem and the emotional pregame observances. The Rams have given away about 4,000 tickets to public servants and victims of the tragedies, and their players have gone the extra mile. Andrew Whitworth of the Rams gave his suite to the game to first responders, one of several donations made by players to reach out. It’s going to be emotional night at the Coliseum. And there will be fans. Because this game was not on the team’s home schedule, they began selling tickets late Tuesday night, and in just a few days, they sold about 71,000 tickets. So along with the 4,000 donated ones, there should be roughly the same crowd as attended the red-hot Packers-Rams game at the Coliseum three weeks ago (75,822). Now for the game. This is just a hunch, because nothing will surprise me in this game, not even a little defense being played. But in a game of tremendous offensive weapons—for both teams at quarterback, for both teams at running back, for both teams at wide receiver—the one player who I think has the best chance to be the game-breaker is Tyreek Hill. There is simply no player like him in football right now. I was in Kansas City last Sunday, and it took Hill (and Patrick Mahomes) 52 seconds to produce a touchdown against a secondary flailing to keep up with this freak of nature. Patrick Mahomes to Hill down the left side for 38 yards on the first play of the game. Mahomes incomplete to Hill. Then Mahomes to Hill, who ran past his man and had the corner pointing at the late safety, for a 37-yard touchdown. By the end of this game, my gut feeling is Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips will really be missing Aqib Talib. On Saturday, talking to Sean Payton during my time with the Saints, I mentioned to him that I’d been in Kansas City last Sunday, and I didn’t think there was a player like Hill in football. Payton smiled and nodded, and looked around to find Drew Brees. “Hey Drew, tell Peter who’s the most dangerous player in football right now,” Payton said. “Tyreek Hill,” Brees said. Payton beamed and nodded. It’s dangerous to predict which of the intergalactic talents will most influence this game. Todd Gurley is such a touchdown machine that he could more than make up for the loss of Cooper Kupp in offensive production. Patrick Mahomes could get on fire, and with the way Andy Reid spreads the field (his widest-split receivers line up so close to the white-striped boundary that I swear one time they’re going to start a play with a foot out of bounds), an accurate Mahomes could strafe the Rams for 350 yards or more. I’m just excited that it’s going to be a game played on a good field, on a 60-degreee evening with just a puff of wind, and we can judge two superb teams going head to head on fairly equal footing, with each missing a good receiver, Sammy Watkins (Chiefs) and Cooper Kupp (Rams). Bring on the spectacle, and the game. (For my prediction, scroll down to the Monday, Monday section.) Much folderol about the Packers’ decision that may have cost them the game at Seattle on Thursday night. I want to focus on it here analytically, because coach Mike McCarthy said after the game, in making the decision he did, that “we played the numbers.” The situation: Green Bay, down 27-24 with 4:20 to play in the fourth quarter, had a 4th-and-2 at its 33-yard line, with one timeout left. Key defenders Kenny Clark and Mike Daniels were out with injuries. McCarthy decided to punt. McCarthy doubled down Friday, back in Green Bay. “Three-and-out there, I think, puts us right about the two-minute [warning],” he said. “I have great confidence in our two-minute offense, especially with Aaron … It’s a solid decision.” I asked the analytics pros at Pro Football Focus on Friday to run their numbers for me, and for their opinion on the McCarthy call. “It’s very difficult for me to conceive of a sound mathematical process that concludes punting was the right decision here,” said George Chahrouri, the director of research and development for PFF. According to the PFF numbers: • Green Bay’s chance of converting on 4th-and-2: 60 percent. • Green Bay’s chance of winning after punting: 21 percent. • Green Bay’s chance of winning after converting the fourth down: 38 percent. • Green Bay’s chance of winning if they don’t convert the fourth down: 20 percent. Translated, the PFF numbers say the Packers would convert fourth-and-two six out of 10 times, and the number say if they convert, they’d have nearly 4 in 10 chance to win the game. But a punt there, per PFF, gives Green Bay a 2 in 10 chance of winning. Extrapolating further: If Green Bay punts, Seattle likely needs two first downs to run out the clock. If the Packers go for it and make it, Aaron Rodgers needs to go about 60 yards in four minutes to score the go-ahead touchdown—or about 40 yards to try a field goal to tie. If they fail to make it, and they hold Seattle on its possession, a Sebastian Janikowski field goal (no sure thing) would give Seattle a 30-24 lead—and would give Rodgers the ball back, needing to go the length of the field in, say, two minutes for the win. With a defense that allowed 77 and 75-yard drives on Seattle’s previous two possessions, and with a defense playing without two of its best players on the front seven, McCarthy—seriously—might want to examine how he calculates whether to go for it or punt in that case. It’s odd to put the burden on a faltering defense to stop Seattle, instead of putting the burden on Rodgers to make a manageable fourth-and-two. Neither “the numbers” nor common sense seems to back up McCarthy. However, this losing is not all McCarthy’s fault. In Seattle, Rodgers made some exquisite throws in the game, but his worm-burner incompletion on what should have been an easy third-and-two play forced the fourth-and-two decision. Mason Crosby missed his seventh kick in seven games, a 47-yarder wide left early in the game, that factored late. McCarthy and staff have done a good job getting unknown young running backs and receivers up to speed this year. It’s not all bad, certainly. But the Packers just feel like a team going in the wrong direction. And with a quarterback as good as Rodgers, club president Mark Murphy and GM Brian Gutekunst have to decide whether a team that’s stumbled with and without Rodgers in the lineup needs a coaching change and a fresh voice in 2019. Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jeff Rohrer, 59, who recently came out as gay and was scheduled to get married to Joshua Ross on Sunday in Los Angeles, on what the experience of coming out late in life (to the New York Times and Outsports) has taught him: Note: Rohrer was the Cowboys’ second-round pick in 1982, out of Yale, and played 83 games over six seasons with the Cowboys. In 1987, when the Cowboys swept the Super Bowl champion Giants, Rohrer had a sack of Phil Simms in both games, per Pro Football Reference. “Wow. What have I learned? A lot of things. The one big thing I learned recently that maybe I didn’t know is that if you’re a good person, and you have had good relationships with people, and you’ve treated people with respect, you’re going to get that back. That is what has happened to me, and it’s been wonderful. “How incredibly nice my friends and teammates have been to me! I don’t deserve it!” [Over the phone from Califormia, Rohrer got emotional and began crying.] “My high school friends, my Yale friends, my Cowboys teammates, my friends from the film business in California, it’s because of the press this week that they found out. No one knew before that. I didn’t tell anyone. It is shocking how well everyone has reacted to me. They’re saying, We’re so happy for you—so happy for your family, and we can’t wait to meet Josh. Things like that. I’ve had like 150 texts, and I’ve got it down to 30, but more keep coming. Gay former Dallas Cowboy Jeff Rohrer is marrying his boyfriend this Sunday #LoveWins https://t.co/2A4e7EhaDZ via @outsports — Outsports (@outsports) November 14, 2018  “The world is a great place today. “You know what I learned from it? We are moving forward as a society. The train has left the station, and you can either be on that train and move forward, or you can sit at the station. Your choice. “It’s hard for anyone to understand what it was like for me growing up, and in the NFL. Now that I’m out, I know that you’re either born gay or you’re not. And when I was growing up, it simply couldn’t be a part of my life. I was a scholar-athlete in high school, and being gay did not fit into that profile. I was a scholar-athlete at Yale, and it did not fit into that profile. I was a Cowboy, and it didn’t fit into that profile. “My life was suppressed and managed. So, I got drafted by the Dallas Cowboys and I’m gonna be gay now? No. I don’t think so. Not with the Dallas Cowboys in 1982. “My life just went on. I was gay, but that was not a part of who I was then. I got married. I loved my wife [Heather]. Still do, even though we are divorced. I still live with my ex-wife and my two kids and Joshua. We’re the happiest family ever. We’ve got the happiest house in town. “And now I’m gonna be who I am. I am so happy. I’m not Jekyll and Hyde anymore. I’m not the monster. “So … what would I say to young people who might be in my shoes today? I would say, everybody has their own situation, their own clock, their own calendar. Some people today might say, ‘It’s better now. Come out tomorrow.’ For some people that’s the right thing; you’re happy and you’re free. But people have to make their own decision. It’s a very personal decision. Ultimately, it’s taking me most of life, 59 years, to make this choice. But I can’t make it for anyone else.” “You played for Tom Landry—the only coach you had in your NFL career. What would he have thought about you today?” “Tom Landry was one of the most amazing people I’ve ever had in my life. He was all about love and understanding with his players. I loved Tom Landry. He was a man of the Bible, and a good Christian man. So he probably wouldn’t have liked this. But I think he would have loved me no matter what.” Two Pro Football Hall of Famers received the highest honor a U.S. citizen can get, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Trump. Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach and Alan Page, the defensive tackle who played for Minnesota and Chicago, had the medals fastened around their necks in a White House ceremony Friday. Not to deflect any praise from Staubach—who has had an incredible and selfless life of achievement and service—but I think Page is far less known nationally than Staubach. Page is a player, and more notably a man, who should be a beacon for all future players to study and appreciate. Playing 15 seasons, from 1967 to 1981, Page never missed a game. In 1971, he became the first of only two defensive players to win Most Valuable Player. In 1976, Page had 18 sacks, rushing almost exclusively in traffic from the inside. In the 70s, he became the first active NFL player (it is believed) to run a marathon; he loved running so much that his weight dropped to 225 pounds and was a major factor in the Viking releasing him—he wouldn’t quit running, and Minnesota didn’t think a modern defensive tackle could play so light. The Bears disagreed, and Page still had some good days in Chicago. In his last NFL game, in December 1981, he sacked Denver quarterbacks three-and-a-half times. Page fought for rights of players as a key member of the NFL Players Association. He passed the bar and began to practice law late in his career. In 1992, he was elected a justice to the Minnesota Supreme Court, and re-elected to three additional six-year terms. Over 30 years, the Page Education Foundation he founded with wife Diane Sims Page helped provide more than $14 million in scholarship money to 7,000 Minnesota students of color; in exchange, the recipients had to perform community service. Later in life, he took joy in serenading runners in the Twin Cities Marathon by playing a tuba along the route … which caused scores of runners to stop, whip out cell phones, and take mid-race selfies with the most respected man in Minnesota. Page has been critical of Trump’s politics, but wouldn’t engage in that when he went to Washington last week. “We live in a time when people would like to shed more heat than light,” he told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “and I am more interested in shedding light.” That is a life incredibly lived. Ezekiel Elliott, running back, Dallas. What a stat line for Elliott—23 rushes, 122 yards, 1 touchdown; 7 catches, 79 yards—in a crucial win for the Cowboys, who now sit just one game back in the NFC East race. And Elliott’s impact wasn’t just when he touched the ball either; his block on a Michael Gallup 10-yard reception in the final drive helped Dallas convert a key third down. Elliott now has four games with 200-plus yards from scrimmage, which ties him with Emmitt Smith and DeMarco Murray for most in franchise history. Lamar Jackson, quarterback, Baltimore. Hey rook. We know you went to the hospital with a stomach ailment on Thursday, but would you mind making your first career start Sunday? Against a team that hates us? Oh, and stop a three-game losing streak too? That was what was facing Jackson as he stepped in for injured Joe Flacco (hip) and started Sunday’s game against the Bengals. Jackson set a single-game record for a Ravens QB with 117 rushing yards, tacked on 150 yards in the air on 13-of-19 passing and simply played “winning football,” according to coach John Harbaugh. He also kept Baltimore’s feeble playoff hopes alive for another week. Kyler Fackrell, linebacker, Green Bay. It’s fashionable to trash Ted Thompson for his last few drafts and for his lax free-agency history, but he did replenish a few slots on defense, including this third-round pick from Utah State. Fackrell had three sacks of Russell Wilson in the 27-24 loss in Seattle, and it should have been four. Wilson, millimeters from being tackled by Fackrell in the second half, had a borderline intentional-grounding on a throwaway that easily could been called for being down or grounding. Fackrell’s game was still a gem. Khalil Mack, game wrecker, Chicago. I’ve lost count how many times we’ve lauded Mack in this space this season. The ex-Raider was at it again Sunday night against Minnesota, registering a sack, a tackle for loss, a fumble recovery and just being a flat-out difference maker every time the Bears defense was on the field. Von Miller, pass rusher, Denver. He made the biggest play in the Broncos’ come-from-behind win over the Chargers in Los Angeles on Sunday. With the Broncos down 12 in the third quarter, Miller smartly sniffed out a screen pass and returned it 42 yards to the Chargers’ 18-yard line. Denver’s offense woke up after that and the team pulled off the upset. Anthony Myers, sophomore punt-returner, Berks Catholic (Reading, Pa.) High School. After being diagnosed with a stage 3 malignant brain tumor Oct. 22, Myers got permission from his doctor last week to play in a Pennsylvania state playoff game Saturday against Milton Hershey High. Myers is an all-purpose weapon with a Christian McCaffrey body type, a college prospect capable of breaking games open even at 16. In the first quarter, he took a Jet Sweep pitch from the quarterback and scored from a yard out. Later in the quarter, lined up at his 20 to receive a punt, Myers took a low punt, broke right, sprinted down the right sideline, cut back and scored on an 80-yard punt return to give the Saints a commanding lead. Anthony Myers 80 yards to the house. I have tears in my eyes gang. @WeAreBC55 21 @miltonhershey 0 2:02 Qtr one. Unreal. @PaFootballNews @CaryMoyer @ddstokes124 pic.twitter.com/qgcId4CgzZ — Bruce Badgley (@BadgleyBruce) November 17, 2018  The crowd went crazy, knowing what is on the line for the young Myers. Berks Catholic won the game, and, just like in the movies, Myers was carried off the field after the game on the shoulders of teammates. Afterward, talking to local sportswriter Bruce Badgley, Myers spoke like someone five times his age. “You never know when the last snap is going to be,” he said. “I was just playing my heart out every single snap.” Funds are being raised for Myers’ treatment, in the form of a GoFundMe page and T-shirt sales. And Saturday night, from one Saint to another, Sean Payton delivered this message to Myers: Sean Payton, head coach, New Orleans. See the lead section. Mike McCarthy, coach, Green Bay. Much blame to go around for the Packers, with Aaron Rodgers starting all 10 games, being 4-5-1 at Thanksgiving, heading into a very tough Sunday-nighter at Minnesota. But McCarthy needs to take his piece of responsibility after the 27-24 loss to Seattle, in part because of what I wrote earlier about his decision to punt, down three, on fourth-and-two with 4:20 left at the Green Bay 33. In a larger sense, Green Bay lost all three road games (Rams, Pats, Seahawks) in this crucial run of play that ends next Sunday night at Minnesota with crummy fourth quarters of competitive games—any of which the Packers could have won. Green Bay is 0-5 on the road for the first time since 1979, and with Aaron Rodgers starting every game. Cam Newton, quarterback, Carolina. Newton did have a good game (357 passing yards, three touchdowns), but his mistake on the two-point conversion pass with the game in the balance is the difference between Carolina being 7-3 or being 6-4 today. And they’re 6-4 because Newton threw the two-point pass way over the head of a wide-open Jarius Wright in the end zone. I “It’s not the first time. I doubt it will be the last time.” —Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, on his sideline spat with coach Jon Gruden, during Sunday’s game against the Cardinals. Coach and QB were visibly upset with each other after Carr was penalized for trying to call back-to-back timeouts. Both Carr and Gruden downplayed the confrontation after the game, which Oakland won to improve to 2-8 on the season. II “I think Russell Wilson would be a good life coach.” —FOX’s Joe Buck, in the third quarter of the Green Bay-Seattle game. I think he is already. III “He is putting Father Time in a chokehold and giving it a noogie.” —Kay Adams of NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football,” on 35-year-old Dolphins running back Frank Gore. IV “We just went in and yelled at each other.” —Seattle coach Pete Carroll, asked what the Seahawks coaches and players, trailing to Green Bay, did in their locker room at halftime on Thursday night. V “If I had told the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s that I was gay, I would have been cut immediately. It was a different world back then. People didn’t want to hear that.” —Jeff Rohrer, the Cowboys’ second-round pick in 1982, a linebacker, to the New York Times’ Vincent M. Mallozzi. Rohrer, 59, came out in recent days to the Times, and to Cyd Ziegler of Outsports. With two big candidates on the field tonight in Los Angeles, here’s my week-11 MVP ballot: 1. Drew Brees, QB, New Orleans. Last week: 1. The absurd greatness of the soon-to-be-40 Brees continued Sunday, when he put up 48 points in the first 53 minutes of the rout of the Eagles. He was 22 of 30 (.733) for four TDs and a no picks and a 153.2 rating … and his 2018 completion rate decreased. 2. Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City. Last week: 2. If Mahomes throws 57 touchdown passes (he needs only 26 in his last six games; a cinch, obviously), I have a feeling I know what else he’ll win besides a lifetime supply of ketchup. 3. Todd Gurley, RB, L.A. Rams. Last week: 4. Easily could move up on this list. And by the way, you think he’s happy Sean McVay got the Rams job in 2017? In Gurley’s 25 games with McVay running the offense, the Rams runner is averaging 139.3 scrimmage yards a game, and he’s scored 39 touchdowns. Thirty-nine TDs, 25 games. That’s pretty good. 4. Ben Roethlisberger, QB, Pittsburgh. Last week: 5. Revenge (over the Jags) is sweet, and he was superb in the fourth quarter when great players win big games. 5. Philip Rivers, QB, L.A. Chargers. Last week: 3. Bad loss to Denver at home, obviously, and Rivers did not play to his level. But he’s gotten the Chargers to a Patriot-like 7-3 record entering the last six weeks. Green Bay’s regular-season record since Christmas Day 2015: 21-22-1. Aaron Rodgers has started 35 of the 44 games. The Packers are 18-16-1 in the games he’s started in that period. I Rams receiver Cooper Kupp had surgery in Los Angeles last week to repair a torn ACL. His surgeon was noted orthopedist Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache. Kupp, wife Anna and their son, displaced by the wildfire near the Rams practice facility in Thousand Oaks, Calif., needed a place to stay. Their new host, for a while: Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache, who has opened his home to the Kupps. II In his two post-game TV interviews (with FOX and NFL Network) totaling 10 minutes and 15 seconds, after Seattle beat Green Bay on Thursday, Russell Wilson used the phrase “stay the course” seven times and “remain the course” once. That is called “staying on point” in the quarterbacking business. III Syracuse reserve basketball player Buddy Boeheim is the son of Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. This is Jim Boeheim’s 43rd season coaching Syracuse; he took the job two years after Richard Nixon was impeached. Jim Boeheim was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005. At the Syracuse-UConn game Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, on national TV, the back of the jersey of Jim Boeheim’s son read BOHEIM. Syracuse misspelled Buddy Boeheim’s last name. How in the world does that happen? pic.twitter.com/tFwVJXa99j — Adam Zagoria (@AdamZagoria) November 16, 2018  In my time in New Orleans last week, I went to dinner one night at a casual seafood-and-gumbo place near the Gleasons’ home, Station 6. Ridiculously tasty gumbo, with fat gulf shrimp and blue crab. Paul Varisco, a local restaurateur and Steve Gleason’s father-in-law (and his partner in the fight against ALS), told me an incredible piece of foodie news that seemed quite encouraging about the future of the city—or at least restaurants in the city. He gave me these stats: • 2005 (pre-Hurricane Katrina)—Greater New Orleans had 465,000 people and 984 restaurants. • Today—Greater New Orleans has about 395,000 people and just over 1,200 restaurants. We were out on a Tuesday night, eating early, and this place was 80 percent filled. “New demographic of people in New Orleans,” Paul Varisco said. “Young, millennials, new neighborhoods, a need for restaurants. Plus, food is in our blood. Most people eat to live. Here, we live to eat.” So we’ve all been wondering: How is it, after years of horrible offensive line play, that the Colts are protecting Andrew Luck so well? Using Pro Football Focus research, the Colts have kept Luck sack-free in four of the last five games because: • The interior line is significantly better. PFF uses a pure win-loss grade for all linemen on every play; if the lineman keeps the passer clean, he gets a win, and if he allows pressure or a sack, it’s a loss. The tackles are actually slightly worse than last year, but the two guards (Quenton Nelson and Mark Glowinski) have been markedly better, as has center Ryan Kelly. On average, they are winning 3.9 percent more … at a 95.9 percent rate. • Luck is faster on the draw. He’s throwing after 2.49 seconds, on average, which is third-fastest in the league through 10 weeks. In 2016, his last season before this year, Luck’s average was 2.88, which was 26th in the league. • Cleaner pockets. This is a combination of the first two factors. In 2018, Luck has had about seven more pass plays per game from a clean pocket than he did in 2016. Add this up, and you see why Luck, through 10 weeks this year compared to his 2016 season, is seven percent more accurate, with a passer rating 17 points better.

Will practice tomorrow. David Tepper’s comment about being at a competitive disadvantage without an indoor facility is on the mark this year. — Joe Person (@josephperson) November 15, 2018  How on God’s green earth, with everything he did to build the Panthers into a strong NFL franchise, did Jerry Richardson never put an indoor facility, or even a relatively cheap-o bubble, somewhere near his stadium in Charlotte? To say that’s a competitive disadvantage is an understatement. To comment on the column, or to say anything about anything, you can reach me by email. Blame the NFL for Mexico City. From Louis P.: “It is hard to believe the NFL could have been caught so flat-footed by the poor condition of the field at Estadio Azteca for the Rams-Chiefs game. I have to assume the back-to-back concert and futbol match had been on the calendar for a long time, but there were no preventive steps taken to assure the field would be ready? Good for the players for standing up for themselves; bad for the NFL and its efforts to expand the brand internationally.” Perfectly stated, Louis. Nothing to add here. The NFL dropped the sod on this one. This is the nicest email of all time. From Peter V.: “I have been reading your column for many years, and each and every Monday morning, I am aghast. I’m 83 years old, and while I am not a Rhodes Scholar, I am also not the Village Idiot. I retired from a profession in which I had to do considerable writing, and for the life of me, I cannot even begin to wrap my mind around the logistics of how you produce that column, ready to go, by a reasonably early hour on Monday morning. The sheer amount of information you provide is staggering. It would take me the better part of a month to produce anything that came close to the providing the quantity of information that you churn out every Monday morning. So, how?” Peter. Wow. I am so moved by your note. When it’s 3:22 a.m. one of these Monday mornings, and I’m drooling on the laptop, wondering how I’m going to invent one last thing I think, I am going to open this email again, and read it. It’ll be like a jolt of adrenalin. Thank you. It would be impossible to write this column in a day, so most often I start on Thursday or Friday. Myron Cope, the late Steelers broadcaster, used to call the little tidbits he’d use on the air “shirtpocket notes,” things he’d gather during the days prior to him being on air, and then he’d pull out the notes and refer to them when he had the microphone in front of him. So, if I read a good story during the week or come across a smart thing someone said or think of a strong opinion, I’ll email it to myself and then throw it in the word salad on Friday or Saturday, when I do maybe 40 to 50 percent of the column. On Sunday, it’s usually a race to the finish. It’s not Faulkner, but I’ve never been a wordsmith. Thanks again. 1. I think these are my quick-hit thoughts of Week 11: a. If I could choose one quarterback to rally my team, down 10 in the second half, it’d be Russell Wilson. Man, he’s the best there is at ignoring what’s happened on the last play and making something happen on the next one. b. Got the feeling, on Jacksonville’s first scoring drive of the game against Pittsburgh, that coach Doug Marrone said, “I’ve had it. We’re doing it all my way now.” Twelve straight runs. Twelve! Runs of 4, 11, 4, 5, 6, 2, 4, 7, 6, 1, 3, 5. More where that came from. c. First 25 minutes: 25 runs by the Jags. d. Awful throw by Marcus Mariota, picked by cornerback Quincy Wilson in Indy, in a surprise. The Titans had gone three straight games without a turnover, and they can’t afford those plays. e. Adrian Peterson had a perfect, young-back’s jump-cut on the way to a touchdown around left end against Houston. “That is not the cut of a 33-year-old,’” said Trent Green on CBS. f. I really hope the Steelers were mostly kidding around and didn’t maliciously steal stuff from Le’Veon Bell’s locker after his tenure with the team ended last week. Just not cool. g. Now I heard that most of the stuff taken was just shoes and free stuff delivered to Bell this summer and fall. I suppose I should laugh it off too. Seemed a little creepy. I mean, those are not Bud Dupree’s belongings. Why is he taking them? h. RIP Ron Johnson. My first football hero. The Giants running back came to my hometown, Enfield, Conn., in 1970, on a free fall night during the first 1,000-yard rushing season in New York Giants history, to sign autographs at the mall in my town. To be able to touch and talk to an NFL star was very cool—and teams and players of today should never forget what it’s like for 13-year-old kids to press the flesh with guys they look up to. i. Watch the strength and moves of Kenny Golladay, who ripped an interception out of Panther corner James Bradberry’s arms, and what a good all-around running back Kerryon Johnson is, and you understand why the Lions think they’ve got franchise players at each spot. They’re 25 and 21, respectively, by the way. j. The Cowboys drive 85 yards on their first drive of the game, and Dak Prescott throws a perfect ball on a simple out route to Cole Beasley, and he drops the easiest target he’ll have all year. And the Cowboys settle for three. Can’t drop those, Cole. k. Malcolm Butler’s not worth the money. I do not say that lightly, or without evidence. l. Andrew Luck to off-the-street wideout Zach Pascal, with a perfect back-shoulder completion … Luck, with the 68-yard deep strike to T.Y. Hilton, which traveled 49 yards in the air (and he was supposed to be restricted by a shaky arm). Luck looks so good right now. m. Perfect pass defensed by Julio Jones in Atlanta, breaking up what would have been a clean pick by Cowboys safety Jeff Heath. Jones even broke it by 2018 NFL preference, keeping his head out of the play and hitting Heath with all shoulder. n. For such an accurate passer, Russell Wilson overthrowing a wide-open Doug Baldwin in the end zone—lasering the ball a good six feet over his head—was a stunning misfire against the Pack. o. I’d say he made up for it. p. What an unaware play by rookie safety Raven Greene of the Packers, gifting the Seahawks a 48-yard pass-interference penalty by plowing into Tyler Lockett like a bull seeing a red flag. Man, who taught Greene how to defend the deep ball? q. Terrelle Pryor has been dropped (or not been pursued when his contract expired) by eight teams since the start of 2014, now that his two-week trial in Buffalo imploded and he got cut there. Amazing. Oakland, Seattle, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Washington, New York Jets, Buffalo. Next: Calgary Stampeders. 2. I think I am sick for Alex Smith. Any injury is awful. A serious injury—Smith suffered two broken leg bones when sacked against Houston on Sunday—to such a selfless player and person just feels worse. 3. I think Adam Schefter is eminently trustworthy, which is why I am fairly sure there was something to his report Sunday that the Browns may be interested in interviewing former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice for their head-coaching job. Notice the wording there: interested in interviewing. Schefter wrote the Browns “would like to interview” Rice. He did not write, the Browns “would like to hire” Rice. Why would Cleveland want to do this—if indeed the Browns ever did? I am reminded of an old Al Davis story. When I asked someone in the Raider organization once about Davis’ tendency to talk to six or eight people every time he had a coaching opening (and to do long, painstaking interviews), he told me Davis loved milking information and ideas from smart people in football, sometimes in the guise of being interested in hiring them. My biggest problem with the concept is, as Rice admitted in a statement Sunday, she is “not ready to coach.” Right. The idea of her being anything other than a consultant-type interview is asinine. Let’s let a cadre of women who love football make their way in it. 4. I think you’ll see me on TV Thursday night, if you wish, at halftime of Falcons-Saints doing a story on former Saints special-teamer Steve Gleason, who has ALS. My story is about his drive to raise money for the Answer ALS cause, which seeks to pool all ALS research information and raise money, while being a dad and husband. Eight years after he was diagnosed, Gleason and wife Michel had their second child, Gray, to go with seven-year-old son Rivers, with the help of a frozen embryo and … well, let Michel tell it: “We had this one embryo left and I knew I was about to turn 40, and so we talked about it, and I wanted to be able to look Rivers in the eye when he got older and say, ‘I did everything I could to be able to give you a sibling.’ That’s how important I think siblings are.” You’ll see the story of a determined man and his family Thursday evening. A quick video teaser: 5. I think, as you may recall by reading this column over the years, I despise the spot foul on defensive pass interference. It’s unfair to be able to have a 48-yard penalty on the defense when the receiver and corner are jousting for the ball, compared to a max of 10 yards for an offensive pass-interference infraction. It’s beyond stupid. It’s flat-out unfair. But I digress. There’s another call I detest. That’s the call when, on a kickoff or punt, a ticky-tack hold or block in the back that wouldn’t have ended the play negates the entirety of the play. Case in point: Thursday night, Trevor Davis had a kick return of 53 yards for Green Bay, to the Seattle 47. Negated. The officials called a hold on Green Bay linebacker Korey Toomer. The replay showed Toomer with his hands on the outside shoulders of Jacob Martin, the Packer linebacker he was blocking. Was Toomer holding Martin? Hard to see, but I saw no jersey tugging, and it didn’t appear to be a hold. But this is the issue: Martin had zero chance to make the play on Trevor Davis.Martin was five yards away from the play as Davis sped through a big hole; Martin could not have impacted the play. It’s just crazy that because of the ticky-tackiest of penalties, the Packers started that drive at their 10-yard line (after the penalty is assessed) instead of the Seattle 47. That’s a 43-yard difference because of a penalty that might not have been a penalty, on a man who could not have made a difference in the outcome of the play. Lord, help us all on this over-officious officiating. 6. I think the final scorecard on guard T.J. Lang—assuming he is cut after his second straight injury-marred season in Detroit, instead of the Lions picking up his 2019 salary of $9 million—will be this: 19 games played, $19.5 million earned. Not bad for a guard, making a million a game. (Lang allowed but two sacks in those 19 games, per Pro Football Focus.) Not blaming Lang, 31, at all for missing so much time and being put on IR Wednesday by the Lions. But Packers GM Ted Thompson gambled the team would be okay without Lang’s weight on the team’s salary cap, and he gambled right, as it turned out. 7. I think I am going to give you a little timeline here, and then I am going to ask you if can possibly understand why an extraordinarily smart man did this: • Thursday, Nov. 15—With snow covering the Detroit Lions’ practice field in Allen Park, Mich., coach Matt Patricia, in shorts on a 34-degree day, puts the Lions through their normal Thursday practice. • Sunday, Nov. 18—Lions play Carolina indoors, at Ford Field. • Thursday, Nov. 22—Lions play Chicago indoors, at Ford Field. • Sunday, Dec. 2—Lions play the Rams indoors, at Ford Field. • Sunday, Dec. 9—Lions play Arizona, likely indoors (and if not indoors, under a retractable roof on a nice day), in Glendale, Ariz. • Sunday, Dec. 16—Lions play Buffalo, outdoors, in Orchard Park, N.Y. So, 31 days after practicing in foul weather, and 31 days after letting the team’s $40-million indoor facility sit idle, and after playing four consecutive games in temperate conditions, the Lions will play a football game in what could well be wintry conditions in western New York. It is well known that Patricia was an aeronautical engineering major at the brainy Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and served on the Patriots staff under Bill Belichick. I am sort of struggling with why any coach would do what he did. 8. I think I can give one idea about Patricia’s move, and that comes from four years covering Bill Parcells in the eighties, and then three decades of covering the league as a whole … and I pass this along not to say I think it’s true, or that it’s good or right, but only to suggest that some coaches feel a need to do this early in their tenures. Sometimes coaches do things not because a particular decision is the best thing for today, but it’s best for the long haul. Patricia inherited a franchise that hadn’t won a playoff game in 27 years. Maybe Patricia feels he wasn’t getting the buy-in from players he wanted. Maybe he feels he needs to show players, Your way hasn’t worked here in years, and we’re going to try my way, and part of my way is to toughen up and for you to follow the leader. Whatever, I have a feeling this is more than just a coach calling an apparently silly outdoor practice in the snow. 9. I think it will be downright ridiculous to pick only two wideouts this year on the AP All-Pro team. I mean, how do you do that? How do you pick, say, DeAndre Hopkins and Tyreek Hill, and then leave off Michael Thomas (Michael Thomas!) and Adam Thielen (Adam Thielen!) and Julio Jones and Brandin Cooks and Davante Adams? And Odell Beckham Jr., who can explode any week? It’s nuts. I’d probably go Hill and Thomas as we speak, but I’d feel absolutely sick to not pick Thielen, and slightly less sick to leave off Hopkins. The Associated Press, curator of the team, has added a Flex position on the team, which is a good idea. But in the day when 70 percent of the game is played with three wides or more, I would recommend three wides on all-pro teams, and five defensive backs as well. 10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week: a. Newspaper Video Story of the Week: Valuable work from the Sacramento Bee, showing what it’s like to sift through the wreckage of the fires in Butte County, where an entire town, Paradise, was lost to the inferno. b. Lord help those in northern California. c. Scariest thing of all: One local official tells the Washington Post that it is “certainly within the realm of possibility that we will never know” how many people were killed in the blaze. d. Inspirational Story of the Week: by Walter Ford of The Union, In Nevada County, Calif., on one high school volleyball team doing an extraordinary act of kindness for another in the path of the Camp Fire. e. Idea of the Week: From GQ, on the value of being bored. A really smart piece, quoting Manoush Zomorodi of the New York Public Radio podcast “Note To Self” thusly: “I learned this really amazing thing that actually when you get bored and you’re not focused on an activity but you’re either lounging or you’re folding socks—something super repetitive that doesn’t need your brain to be engaged—that’s when you ignite this network in your brain called the default mode. Now neuroscientists know that the default mode is when you do your most original thinking. You do your problem-solving. It’s where you have imagination, where you have empathy. Your mind does something that’s kind of like time traveling. You go back and you think of things that happened and you make sense of them and then you extract lessons from them.” f. In other worlds, screen time 24/7 (of, if you actually sleep, then 17/7) wipes out your imagination. g. Column of the Week: from a trauma surgeon in Maryland, Jacques Mather, writing in the Washington Post: “To the mother whose son I couldn’t save.” An emotional piece that, no matter how you feel about firearms and their place in our society, I strongly recommend. h. Mather writes: “When a life is lost, I alone must corral parents and siblings into a private room to inflict the last salvo. The bullet destroyed your son’s life; my words will destroy yours. Our gazes locked together in that private room, and I watched the hope disappear from your eyes as your son’s demise became your new reality. The sadness filled the shrinking room as though I were watching an explosion with the sound muted. You sat still while others in the room yelled and cried. And then you said something under your breath — a whisper in the mayhem: ‘How many more?’ The last three words were left unsaid: ‘ . . . have to die.’ These words are what prompted this letter.” i. Newspaper Story of the Week: from Emily Lane of the New Orleans Times-Picayune, regarding a supposed bomb threat in the city. A passage: “A man accused of threatening to blow up Willie’s Chicken Shack Tuesday night (Nov. 13) claimed to police when confronted about the allegation that his words were merely a reference to a bowel movement, the man’s warrant states. Arthur Posey, 30, was booked on charges in connection to a bomb threat after his story was not corroborated with the restaurant’s employees … Posey claimed to the officer he told a male employee he was going to ’blow the bathroom up,’ in reference to a bowel movement.’ However, police say a Willie’s Chicken Shack employee told officers, ‘Mr. Posey never told him anything about a bathroom.’ “ j. My only question: Did Emily Lane write that story doubled over in laughter? k. UConn’s going to have a good men’s basketball team. The new coach, Danny Hurley, obviously coaches defense. I watched 10 minutes of UConn-Syracuse, and that’s all you need to see to know that if you don’t play D, you’re not playing for Danny Hurley. l. Kyrie Irving the basketball player reminds me of Le’Veon Bell the football player. Patient. Really good. m. I’m not a big basketball guy, but watching Kawhi Leonard of the Raptors and Irving of the Celtics duel is a lot of fun. n. Congrats, Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, on the “Mike and Mike” election to the Radio Hall of Fame. You guys got the job done, for a very long time. o. Coffeenerdness: Quite pleased with your drip coffee, PJ’s of New Orleans airport, a strong brew, and just as pleased with the quality of your servers. p. Beernerdness: Lucky enough to sample Canebrake Louisiana Wheat Ale (Parish Brewing Company, Broussard, La.), and I strongly recommend if you see it somewhere on the Gulf Coast. Delicious, refreshing, sort of sweet (from Louisiana sugarcane, the brewery says), with a touch of citrus. Outstanding beer. q. Fantastic 39-year run at William & Mary, Jimmye Laycock. He coached Mike Tomlin and Sean McDermott, and McDermott and Dan Quinn both coached on his William & Mary staff. Saturday’s finale: a 10-0 loss to Richmond. r. If you’d told me that Maryland scored 51 points, I’d have responded, “This season?” s. Mookie Betts just finished a year when he was American League MVP, World Series champion, American League batting champion, American League Gold Glove right fielder, American League Silver Slugger outfielder. He led the major leagues in slugging percentage. He led the American League in extra-base hits despite missing 26 games. He made one of the throws of the year, gunning down Tony Kemp of the Astros trying to stretch a single into a double (looked like it would be an easy make for the speedy Kemp) with a 140-foot laser to second base. He had the highest WAR of any player since 2002. He is 26. He seems Mike Trout-humble. What a future he has. t. That Elton John holiday commercial for John Lewis, the British department store? Wow. Just wow. You must have seen it, but if not, here you go: What a pleasure it was to be part of this wonderful @jlandpartners Christmas advert. Hope you enjoy it. Elton xo #EltonJohnLewis 🎹 pic.twitter.com/LnA0clEcSW — Elton John (@eltonofficial) November 15, 2018  u. The look on the little boy’s face when he came down the stairs on Christmas morning … that slayed me. Awesome. v. When I was a kid, I loved Elton John. (Still do.) I was 19 on the day of the Bicentennial, July 4, 1976. It was the summer after my freshman year at Ohio University, and I went with a couple of friends to see Elton John in Foxboro at the old stadium there, Schaefer Stadium. We got there the night before and camped out. What a night. Elton came out dressed as the Statue of Liberty. Late in the show, here came Billie Jean King, and they did a “Philadelphia Freedom” duet. Cool stuff. w. Finally, congratulations to my friend Branislav Vukojevic on becoming an American citizen Friday in Orange County, Calif. Branislav emigrated from Serbia to New York in 2006, established himself as a personal trainer, and we met at a gym in Manhattan in 2011. We trained together for four-plus years. Focused, intense but friendly, wonderful at his job, and a terrific husband and father. He transferred to an Equinox gym in Irvine, Calif., this fall, and that’s where he passed his citizenship test Friday morning. x. Branislav, on his journey, is something we all should read, because we live in a pretty great country, and part of being great is we’re fortunate to be able to add people like Branislav Vukojevic to our citizenry. Sometimes it’s good to get that reminder. In his own words: “I came in 2006 because I felt that Serbia cannot fulfill the ambitions that I have. I used to tell my Mom, ‘One day I am going to live in America.’ I was a big dreamer. Living here, I understand that everything is in my power. I create my own reality. The U.S. offers me to be the best I can be. When I passed the test and I was a citizen, I took a moment with myself. I am a little teary. I am so grateful. “It feels amazing. One of the things I am so proud of is I have the right to vote. I can help make a change. “Here in California, the beaches are paradise. I really have to pinch myself that I live here. I am very grateful. I work hard, and I work with passion because I love my work. This country will reward you even more for your work and your passion. That is why I love America.” Kansas City 37, L.A. Rams 33. Think of this: One of the great NFL games in years was not scheduled for Los Angeles six mornings ago. And tonight, 70-something thousand people will be in the stands in the storied Los Angeles Coliseum watching it. Quite an invention by the Rams. Regarding the score: Chiefs have the ball last. That kind of game. Monday … Los Angeles. Regular-season game of the year, matching the Rams and Chiefs with twin 9-1 records. Fair warning: Don’t miss the burgeoning Rams’ tradition, the lighting of the torch, at the Coliseum. Wednesday … Dallas. Happy 52nd birthday, Troy Aikman. Thursday … Everywhere. Chicago-Detroit at 12:30 p.m. ET for, presumably, indoor football (though Matt Patricia might petition to play in the snow). Playoff implications for the NFC North-leading Bears … Washington-Dallas at 3:30 ET, when the Cowboys try to take the NFC East lead away from Washington. Playoff implications for both … Atlanta-New Orleans at 7:20 ET, Falcons lead the all-time series, 52-47, and that just might be the score on this night. Playoff implications for both—and probably the last chance for Atlanta to keep January hope alive. Friday … Leland, Miss. Happy 60th birthday, Johnie Cooks. One of my favorite names (one “n” in “Johnie”) from one of my favorite drafts (Marcus Allen 10th overall, Oliver Luck 44th, Morten Andersen 86th). Cooks was the second pick in 1982, by the Baltimore Colts. After picking Cooks, the Colts traded huge fan favorite quarterback Bert Jones to the Rams in a package that included the fourth pick in the draft. With that pick, Baltimore selected Ohio State quarterback Art Schlichter, and in less than a year, Schlichter was suspended by the NFL for a year for gambling. And then John Elway was the first-round pick the next year, and again the Colts failed to secure a quarterback of the future because they traded Elway … and, well, I don’t know how Johnie Cooks begat Art Schlichter and John Elway, but there you have it. Condoleeza Rice will be Browns coach when I join the Trump Cabinet. Mike McCarthy’s 4th down decision was the right call. He was being diplomatic and not coming out and saying Rodgers was playing like crap. Here are Rodgers’ second half prices: – 6 plays, Punt – 3 plays, Punt – 4 plays, Punt – 7 plays, FG – 3 plays, Punt 5 drives and only 3 points to show for it. But sure, let’s blame McCarthy for not going for it on fourth down… That Saints segment was prime. They said Wentz was lousy hahahaha. Detroit practiced outside in the snow. In other news so did a lot of other teams too. Maybe if the Panthers had practiced in the rain they woulda won that game? Come on, I know he’s a defensive player–much less *not* a quarterback–but Mack can’t even crack the Top 5 of your MVP shortlist? In reference to your point about calls being made well away from the action, other sports do in fact take this into account. In rugby, for example, if the ref sees an infraction, he will raise his arm to indicate that he saw it. However, he will wait to see how the action plays out and only call the penalty if it becomes clear that the infraction benefited the team committing it. If it clearly did not, he can declare “no advantage” and not call the penalty. fmiaakammqbpft says: November 19, 2018 at 8:50 am Detroit practiced outside in the snow. In other news so did a lot of other teams too. Maybe if the Panthers had practiced in the rain they woulda won that game? ==== Yes of course, because no one on the Panthers had ever played football in the rain before. Of course offenses can come up with all these quirky gimmicks. The No Fun League has outlawed defense. Did anyone see the roughing call on C Cambell in the Jgas game that negated an interception? There was a more egregious sack on Ben in the game later that wasn’t called. PFF says: GB winning after punting: 21% GB winning after not converting on 4th: 20% So, the 40 yrds of field position you gain from punting is worth just 1% chance of winning? This is mathmatical nonsense. You gotta stop Seattle either way. Not an egregiously bad call. McCarthy went conservative on a 50/50 call(I realize he’s going to be fired). Perhaps it’s part of the PFF percentages, but even if Packers converted 4th & 2 and went on to score to tie or go ahead, Seahawks still had all 3 time outs and had scored on last two possessions, i.e. reasonable chance to score on final possession assuming they got the ball back with more than, say, 1 minute. Sorry, but the Steelers get a pass on this one. After an off season and regular season up till the day Bell finally came clean with the Steelers of tweets, frustration, torment and speculation, false hope and disappointment while they tried to maintain focus, deleting Bell from the locker room was much needed closure on the entire matter. I doubt very much that Bell left anything of value beyond team equipment in that locker. Thank you for linking the story of Northern California’s Forest Lake Christian School’s (Auburn, CA-Home of race driver Alexander Rossi) playoff game with the team from Paradise, CA. There is so much more to this story and lives were changed that night. I have never seen such an extraordinarily, lavish act of love upon another. This is the love of God in action. The impact of this one event will live on forever. Love your column Peter. I know they only have Three wins, but wow, no mention of Saquon Barkley having the best game so far of a Stellar Rookie year, or Eli Manning having one of his best games as a pro, and for at least one week, turning back the hands of time. Red zone in the 10 am Pacific slot was off the hook yesterday. Best 3+ hours of football every week but with all these down to the wire games, it was extra special. The gofundme campaign for the young man with cancer is heartwarming. The fact that a high school kid needs a gofundme campaign so that his parents can afford cancer treatments is infuriating. And should be to anyone with even a semblance of a brain. PENALTIES THAT MAKE NO SENSE: watching the steelers/jaguars game, rothlisberger throws an interception and Calais Campbell penalized for roughing the passer. the penalty over turns the interception and steelers continue their drive. the penalty did not cause the interception and the defense should not be stripped of their earned take away. the rule should be changed to defense keeps the ball and 15 yards marked off from the spot of the interception. McCarthy is well, McCarthy and that used to be enough to make the playoffs every year. Whats the difference? Rodgers is just playing really well but no where near well enough to overcome mediocre coaching and a decidedly average roster. If pass interference can be waved off because a ball isn’t considered catchable, I don’t see why holding can’t be waved off if the held player could not have affected the play. Branislav Vukojevic did it legally, too bad there are millions doing it illegally. You must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!

The reversal came days after a judge ordered the administration to reinstate the journalist's press pass. Announcing its decision on Monday, the White House also issued "rules governing future press conferences". These include allowing only a single question from each journalist. Follow-up questions, the White House adds in a letter to Mr Acosta, will only be allowed "at the discretion of the president or other White House officials". The letter warned that further action against Acosta will be taken unless he follows the new rules. Mr Trump has threatened to walk out of future press briefings if reporters do not act with "decorum". Reacting to Monday's decision restoring his pass, Acosta said he was looking forward to returning to the White House. Thanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday... let's get back to work. End of Twitter post by @Acosta During the 8 November news conference, a White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he attempted to ask the president a follow-up question. Mr Trump called Acosta "a rude, terrible person" and the reporter was barred from entering the White House a day later. CNN filed a lawsuit to have Acosta's pass restored, and was joined by other media organisations in their efforts including conservative-leaning Fox News. In a preliminary ruling on Friday, a Washington DC judge said the administration had not provided sufficient justification for the revocation, and Acosta's constitutional rights outweighed the White House's right to have an orderly news conference. Analysis, by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington With the tone of a not-angry-just-disappointed parent, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has issued a series of rules she says will outline acceptable reporter conduct. The rules, of course, are open to interpretation. Which reporter will be the first to try a multipart question? Who gets to determine what constitutes a proper follow-up? If this is how "decorum" is restored in a White House where the president himself tells journalists they ask "stupid questions", the holes are big enough to drive a truck through. Mostly this appears to be a face-saving way for the administration to back down from a legal fight it wasn't likely to win. The White House made its point, and reporters may think twice before pressing Ms Sanders, or the president, quite as hard with their questions. For press freedom advocates, this could be a chilling development. For the president's supporters, who celebrate his "enemy of the people" rhetoric, it's a welcome first step. The White House backs down from a legal fight over the reporter but sets rules for news conferences. 15 sayings from around the world

It’s still waiting. They didn’t like the West’s playbook. So they wrote their own. The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It’s still waiting. By PHILIP P. PAN Photographs by BRYAN DENTON NOV. 18, 2018 In the uncertain years after Mao’s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West? It was the autumn of 1984, and on the other side of the world, Ronald Reagan was promising “morning again in America.” China, meanwhile, was just recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil. There had been progress in the countryside, but more than three-quarters of the population still lived in extreme poverty. The state decided where everyone worked, what every factory made and how much everything cost. The students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy — and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it. Late one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy — and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. “As they were discussing the problem, I didn’t say anything at all,” recalled Xu Jing’an, now 76 and retired. “I was thinking, how do we make this work?” How China became a superpower The Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation. China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union. An epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead — and how to do so in a new era of American hostility. The pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China’s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations. During this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot. But neither happened. Instead, China’s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail. In late September, the People’s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride — a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world’s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin. The world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China’s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world — and the American understanding of how the world works. There is no simple explanation for how China’s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear — a sense of crisis among Mao’s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as they put the disasters of Mao’s rule behind them, China’s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace “reform” to survive — but “reform” must never include democratization. China has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground. Many people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared. Whether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely. None of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out. Mr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao’s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a “cadre school” doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao’s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China’s first stock market in Shenzhen. Among the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China’s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China’s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them. Mr. Wang headed China’s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing’s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party’s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China’s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party’s leader. The careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China’s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists. Bureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September. “Sanya,” Mr. Yan said, referring to the southern resort town he leads, “must be a good butler, nanny, driver and cleaning person for businesses, and welcome investment from foreign companies.” It was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch. Afraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it. Party leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach “crossing the river by feeling the stones” — allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in “special economic zones,” while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first. “There was resistance,” Mr. Xu said. “Satisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.” American economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party’s strategy “an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.” But China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation’s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao’s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction. That included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief “study tours.” When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them. At the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system — the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined. In cities like Shanghai, Chinese schoolchildren outperform peers around the world. For many parents, though, even that is not enough. Because of new wealth, a traditional emphasis on education as a path to social mobility and the state’s hypercompetitive college entrance exam, most students also enroll in after-school tutoring programs — a market worth $125 billion, according to one study, or as much as half the government’s annual military budget. Another explanation for the party’s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao’s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant. The party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets. These seemingly minor adjustments had an outsize impact, injecting a dose of accountability — and competition — into the political system, said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. “China created a unique hybrid,” she said, “an autocracy with democratic characteristics.” As the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled. The private sector now produces more than 60 percent of the nation’s economic output, employs over 80 percent of workers in cities and towns, and generates 90 percent of new jobs, a senior official said in a speech last year. As often as not, the bureaucrats stay out of the way. “I basically don’t see them even once a year,” said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. “I’m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?” In recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party’s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access. In doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy — that it can build and run “national champions” capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington. In December, the Communist Party will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the “reform and opening up” policies that transformed China. The triumphant propaganda has already begun, with Mr. Xi putting himself front and center, as if taking a victory lap for the nation. He is the party’s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng’s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by “hostile foreign forces.” In other words, he appears to have less use for the “opening up” part of Deng’s slogan. Of the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world’s factory. China’s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations. The party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as “grown out of the soil of China” and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China’s rise — that Beijing’s former enemies helped make it possible. The United States and Japan, both routinely vilified by party propagandists, became major trading partners and were important sources of aid, investment and expertise. The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988. Mr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy. But in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes. Mr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike’s largest Chinese supplier. “China’s policies were tremendous,” he recalled. “They were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.” Mr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China — and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland’s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico. The timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan’s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy. Before long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China. Now Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island’s future is uncertain. There are echoes of Taiwan’s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment. The remorse may be strongest in the United States, which brought China into the World Trade Organization, became China’s largest customer and now accuses it of large-scale theft of technology — what one official called “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” Many in Washington predicted that trade would bring political change. It did, but not in China. “Opening up” ended up strengthening the party’s hold on power rather than weakening it. The shock of China’s rise as an export colossus, however, was felt in factory towns around the world. In the United States, economists say at least two million jobs disappeared as a result, many in districts that ended up voting for President Trump. Over lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China’s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. “It was very easy,” said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. “One day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.” Until the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s. “At the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn’t have gone,” he recalled. “So this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.” Such has been the seesaw pattern of the party’s success. The pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao’s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to “reform and opening up” once more. Many who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation’s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs. Now Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle? The fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China’s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe. The party has always been vigilant about crushing potential threats — a fledgling opposition party, a popular spiritual movement, even a dissident writer awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But with some big exceptions, it has also generally retreated from people’s personal lives and given them enough freedom to keep the economy growing. The internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it. In 2011, it confronted a crisis. After a high-speed train crash in eastern China, more than 30 million messages criticizing the party’s handling of the fatal accident flooded social media — faster than censors could screen them. Panicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same. The compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties — and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape. “The cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,” said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. “We still get the information we need for economic progress.” China is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other. The question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner. The trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing’s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached. The two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades — and how it should do so now. Mr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration’s policies as proof of what they have always suspected — that America is determined to keep China down. At the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party’s formula for success may be faltering. Prosperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough. “The basic problem is, who is growth for?” said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. “We haven’t solved this problem.” Growth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population. Mr. Xi himself has acknowledged that the party must adapt, declaring that the nation is entering a “new era” requiring new methods. But his prescription has largely been a throwback to repression, including vast internment camps targeting Muslim ethnic minorities. “Opening up” has been replaced by an outward push, with huge loans that critics describe as predatory and other efforts to gain influence — or interfere — in the politics of other countries. At home, experimentation is out while political orthodoxy and discipline are in. In effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture — and that to survive and surpass the United States it must. Certainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump’s America is in retreat while China’s moment is just beginning. Then again, China has a way of defying expectations. Philip P.

---split---4.0---split---https://www.nbcumv.com/talent/lester-holt/bios_read_more---split---Lester Holt is an award-winning journalist and anchor of "NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt," the network's flagship broadcast currently celebrating its 70th anniversary. Holt also leads NBC News’ special reports, breaking news and primetime political coverage. Holt was named to the role of “NBC Nightly News” anchor in June 2015 after eight years as anchor of "NBC Nightly News" weekend editions and 12 years as co-anchor of "Weekend TODAY." In addition, Holt has served as principal anchor of "Dateline NBC" since September 2011. Holt joined NBC News in 2000 and is known for his outstanding work in the field, reporting and anchoring from breaking news events across the globe. He traveled to PyeongChang in February where he led NBC News’ coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, anchoring “Nightly News” from South Korea and reporting on the stories behind the world’s greatest athletes in what was his ninth Olympic Games. It was Holt’s second trip of 2018 to the Korean Peninsula, where just weeks before the Olympics he reported on the growing tensions between the United States and North Korea from inside the totalitarian state. Over the past several years, he has reported from Manchester, Brussels and Paris on the terrorist attacks that took place across Europe. Previously, Holt anchored from South Africa during the Nelson Mandela memorial service; reported from the streets of Cairo on the latest political and civil unrest in Egypt during the Arab Spring; covered the earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan; and reported on the immediate aftermath and response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti. His field reporting often focuses on people most directly affected by the biggest stories of the day. In the week leading up to the presidential inauguration in January 2017, he traveled across the U.S. talking with Americans about the nation’s most pressing issues and their hopes for the next four years. Holt also hosted a roundtable of South Carolina voters before the 2016 primary, spoke with Baltimore residents following city-wide protests in April 2015, and had an exclusive talk with the witness who recorded the Walter Scott shooting. Holt is deeply committed to providing viewers on-the-ground, first-person accounts when disaster strikes. He traveled to Houston and Southern Florida in the fall of 2017 to get live, first-hand perspectives of the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. He also reported from Las Vegas this past October in the aftermath of the Mandalay Bay shooting, and from Sutherland Springs, Texas after the massacre in a church there took the lives of 26 people. As a preeminent broadcast journalist, Holt was selected to moderate the first presidential debate of 2016, which was the most-watched debate in American history. Holt’s one-on-one with President Trump in May 2017 stands as the most consequential interview of the Trump presidency, after Trump told Holt the firing of former FBI head James Comey was tied to the Russia investigation. In January 2017, he traveled with President Obama on the Commander in Chief’s final trip aboard Air Force One, for an in-depth interview in Chicago. Earlier in the 2016 presidential race, Holt received praise for his work moderating the first Democratic debate of the year. He has also sat down for revealing, news-making interviews with candidates Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. NBC News was the most watched news organization of Election 2016, with Holt anchoring all of the network’s primetime coverage through the Republican and Democratic conventions, debates and Election Night. Before becoming co-anchor of "Weekend TODAY” in 2003, Holt anchored "Lester Holt Live," a daily news show on MSNBC. Holt served as a primary anchor for MSNBC's coverage of major news events, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and the war in Afghanistan, and he was the lead daytime anchor for MSNBC's coverage of Decision 2000. Holt also served as anchor of "Countdown: Iraq," a nightly news telecast concentrating on the latest developments surrounding the war with Iraq, from October 2002 through March 2003. For “Dateline NBC,” Holt has anchored numerous specials and investigative reports, such as “Breathless,” a story of injustice that examined the connection between childhood asthma and poverty in America. Holt also reported on wrongful convictions involving Richard Rosario and Johnny Hincapie, two cases that made national headlines. Additionally, he reported three hours on the aftermath of the Great Recession as part of the “American Now” documentary series. Holt came to MSNBC from after 14 years at WBBM-TV in Chicago. Previously, Holt worked as a reporter at WCBS-TV in New York City and sister station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles as a reporter and weekend anchor. His work has been recognized with numerous honors, including multiple Emmy Awards and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism award. In June 2017, Holt was honored with Quinnipiac University’s Fred Friendly First Amendment Award. In April 2016, Holt received several notable designations: he was featured on TIME’s 100 Most Influential People list, The Hollywood Reporter’s Most Powerful People in New York list and was named “Journalist of the Year” by the National Association of Black Journalists. He was named to Variety’s New York Power List in September 2016. Holt studied government at California State University in Sacramento. He resides in New York City with his wife.

---split---4.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/democratic-senators-sue-whitakers-appointment-ag-59293056---split---Three Senate Democrats filed a lawsuit Monday arguing that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and asking a federal judge to remove him. The suit, filed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, argues that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution because he has not been confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker was chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and was elevated to the top job after Sessions was ousted by President Donald Trump on Nov. 7. The Constitution's Appointments Clause requires that the Senate confirm all principal officials before they can serve in their office. The Justice Department released a legal opinion last week that said Whitaker's appointment would not violate the clause because he is serving in an acting capacity. The opinion concluded that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a "sufficiently senior pay level." "President Trump is denying senators our constitutional obligation and opportunity to do our job: scrutinizing the nomination of our nation's top law enforcement official," Blumenthal said in a statement. "The reason is simple: Whitaker would never pass the advice and consent test. In selecting a so-called 'constitutional nobody' and thwarting every senator's constitutional duty, Trump leaves us no choice but to seek recourse through the courts." The lawsuit comes days after a Washington lawyer challenged Whitaker's appointment in a pending Supreme Court case dealing with gun rights. The attorney, Thomas Goldstein, asked the high court to find that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and replace him with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The state of Maryland also made a similar court filing last week in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over the Affordable Care Act. Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation. The Justice Department issued a statement Monday defending Whitaker's appointment as "lawful" and said it comports with the Appointments Clause, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and legal precedent. "There are over 160 instances in American history in which non-Senate confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis, the duties of a Senate-confirmed position," Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. "To suggest otherwise is to ignore centuries of practice and precedent." The Federal Vacancies Reform Act allows an acting official to serve in a vacant position for up to 210 days, though the official may continue serving while a president's nomination to that position is pending before the Senate.

---split---4.0---split---http://pewresearch.tumblr.com/---split---The public is generally positive about the outcome of last week’s midterm elections. Yet most Americans think that neither Democratic congressional leaders nor Donald Trump will be successful in getting their policies passed into law during the next two years. And after years of growing political divisions in Congress and the nation, the public expects little improvement in relations between Republicans and Democrats in Washington in the coming year. Most expect partisan relations will get worse or stay the same. Just 9% expect that partisan relations will improve. From the very start of Donald Trump’s presidency, Americans have been divided along partisan lines in their views of him. But partisan divisions in U.S. politics are certainly nothing new. Our new video puts views of Trump into context by looking at the country’s growing partisan divides over time. A new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that the “post-Millennial” generation is already the most racially and ethnically diverse generation, as a bare majority of 6- to 21-year-olds (52%) are non-Hispanic whites. And while most are still pursuing their K-12 education, the oldest post-Millennials are enrolling in college at a significantly higher rate than Millennials were at a comparable age. The changing patterns in educational attainment are driven in part by the shifting origins of young Hispanics. Post-Millennial Hispanics are less likely than Millennial Hispanics to be immigrants – 12% of post-Millennial Hispanics were born outside the U.S., compared with 24% of Millennial Hispanics in 2002. More broadly, the post-Millennial generation is being shaped by changing immigration patterns. Immigration flows into the U.S. peaked in 2005, when the leading edge of the post-Millennial generation was age 8 or younger. The onset of the Great Recession and the large decline in employment led to fewer immigrants coming to the United States, including immigrant children. As a result, the post-Millennial generation has fewer foreign-born youth among its ranks than the Millennial generation did in 2002 and a significantly higher number who were born in the U.S. to immigrant parents, though this may change depending on future immigration flows. Other key findings: Japanese feel better about their economy than at any time in nearly two decades. But the overall mood in Japan remains wary, if not pessimistic. The prevailing view is that average people are worse off than before the Great Recession, while few think the next generation will fare any better. Automation is one reason the future may not be so bright for ordinary people: Majorities of Japanese say growing reliance on robots and computers will lead to joblessness and income inequality. And less than half the public is satisfied with the way democracy is working in Japan, while more than half hold the view that politicians do not care about ordinary people, that they are corrupt and that elections ultimately do not change much. Roughly half of YouTube users say the platform is very important for helping them figure out how to do things they’ve never done before. That works out to 35% of all U.S. adults, once both users and non-users of the site are accounted for. And around one-in-five YouTube users (representing 13% of the total adult population) say it is very important for helping them understand events that are happening in the world. Fully 81% of all parents with children age 11 or younger say they ever let their child watch videos on YouTube. And 34% of parents say their child watches content on YouTube regularly. But even as many users are turning to content on YouTube to help them understand the world and learn new things, large shares say they encounter negative experiences with content on the platform. Around two-thirds of users (64%) say they at least sometimes encounter videos that seem obviously false or untrue while using the site, while 60% at least sometimes encounter videos that show people engaging in dangerous or troubling behavior. And among parents who let their young child watch content on the site, 61% say they have encountered content there that they felt was unsuitable for children. Over the past two years, Americans have become more likely to say it is “stressful and frustrating” to have political conversations with those they disagree with. The change in opinions has come largely among Democrats: 57% now say that talking about politics with people they disagree with is stressful and frustrating, up from 45% two years ago. By contrast, Republicans’ feelings about political conversations with people they disagree have changed very little. About half (49%) continue to find such conversations stressful and frustrating. Overall, 53% of Americans say talking about politics with people they disagree with is generally stressful and frustrating; fewer (45%) say such conversations are usually “interesting and informative.” In March 2016, during the presidential primaries, slightly more found such conversations interesting and informative (51%) than stressful and frustrating (46%). Majorities of Republicans and Democrats say talking politics with people whose views differ does not lead to more common ground A majority of Americans (63%) say that when they talk about politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought previously. Fewer than a third of Americans (31%) say they find they have more in common with people they disagree with politically. There is little division across the partisan and ideological spectrum: More than six-in-ten in each group say they find that when they discuss politics with people they disagree with, they usually find they have “less in common” politically than they thought. Liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media to mobilize others or find like-minded groups. Some 44% of liberal Democrats say they have used these sites in the past year to encourage others to take action on an issue that was important to them, while a similar share (43%) have taken part in a group that shares their interest in a cause. These shares fall to around a third or fewer among conservative or moderate Democrats and among conservative, moderate or liberal Republicans. Large majorities of registered voters backing Democrats (77%) and those supporting Republicans (82%) expect their party to hold a House majority after the elections. But Republicans are more bullish than Democrats about Senate control: 87% of Republican voters expect the GOP to hold a Senate majority; 62% of Democratic voters expect their party to have the majority. Two-thirds of Americans (67%) say everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote, but Republicans – especially conservative Republicans – are less likely to hold this view. Some 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, and this is particularly true in lower-income households. This aspect of the digital divide – often referred to as the “homework gap” – can be an academic burden for teens. Black teens, as well as those from lower-income households, are especially likely to face these school-related challenges as a result. Younger adults in the U.S. are better able than older adults to distinguish factual statements from opinion statements, according to a survey conducted earlier this year in which respondents were asked to categorize five factual statements and five opinion statements. Younger adults are not only better overall at correctly identifying factual and opinion news statements – they can do so regardless of the ideological appeal of the statements. A growing share of U.S. adults – including majorities in both parties – say drug addiction is a very big problem in the country today. Increasing shares of Americans also cite the affordability of college and sexism as very big problems. Partisans differ over the seriousness of many other problems, including the gap between the rich and poor and gun violence. There were nearly 5 million English language learners in U.S. public schools in fall 2015, representing 9.5% of enrollees. These students are a diverse group from many different states and native language backgrounds. A new interactive shows Spanish is by far the most common language they speak at home, but other languages are common, too. Spanish is the most common language spoken at home for ELL students, but not in all states. Roughly three-quarters of students with limited English proficiency in U.S. public schools (77%) said they spoke Spanish as their primary language at home in 2015. Although only 2% of ELL students nationwide speak Arabic at home, the share is greater in some states, such as Michigan, where 24% speak it. Brazilians will vote Sunday in a runoff presidential election. In a survey conducted this spring, 9% of Brazilians described the current economic situation in their country as good, even lower than the share (15%) who said this in 2017. A plurality of 43% said the financial situation of average Brazilians is worse than it was 20 years ago, and about half (53%) said children in Brazil will be financially worse off than their parents when they grow up. Voting is compulsory in Brazil: It is one of a handful of countries where at least nine-in-ten people say they have voted in the past. Photo: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images Half of U.S. Latinos say their situation in the country has worsened over the past year, up from 32% in the weeks after the 2016 election and the highest level since the Great Recession. More say they have serious concerns about their place in America today and a majority worry that they, a family member or close friend could be deported. Many blame the current administration for what they see as the worsening situation of Hispanics, the nation’s largest minority group. Two-thirds (67%) say the administration’s policies have been harmful to Hispanics – a much higher share than during the administration of either Democrat Barack Obama (15% in 2010) or Republican George W. Bush (41% in 2007). Overall, six-in-ten Hispanics (62%) say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today, up since 2017 and the highest level since the Great Recession a decade ago, when 70% of Hispanics said they were dissatisfied with the nation’s direction. And yet, attitudes among Latinos are not monolithic. Slightly less than a quarter of Latinos (23%) identify as Republican or describe themselves as leaning Republican. Among this group, six-in-ten (59%) approve of President Trump’s job performance, compared with just 8% of Latino Democrats who say the same.3 In addition, half as many Latino Republicans as Latino Democrats (28% vs. 57%) say the Hispanic population’s situation has grown worse over the past year. Notably, partisan differences do not extend to voting. In each partisan camp, about six-in-ten (59%) registered voters say they are more enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterms than in the last congressional elections. This year, more than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote, up from 25 million in 2014.

---split---4.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dozens-sealed-criminal-indictments-dc-docket-mueller/story?id=59249030---split---Nearly three dozen sealed criminal indictments have been added to the federal court docket in Washington, D.C. since the start of 2018. Sealed criminal court files are assigned a case number, but do not indicate the identity of the parties or the nature of the charges, so it is impossible for the public to discern what those sealed cases contain. But several legal experts told ABC News the number of sealed cases awaiting action right now is unusual. Fourteen were added to the docket since late August alone, a review by ABC News has found, just as the midterm elections were drawing near and longstanding Justice Department policy precluded prosecutors from taking any public action that could appear to be aimed at influencing political outcomes. And the inadvertent discovery on Thursday night of what appear to be secret charges pending against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has drawn fresh attention to the mystery. Legal experts told ABC News that the sealed cases could be tied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possibly part of a quiet effort to protect his investigation from any premature effort to shut it down. “I assume that Mueller knew that once the election was over, there could be an existential threat to his investigation,” said Matthew Miller, a former senior Justice official under former Attorney General Eric Holder. “He knew the best thing to do was act before that.”     A spokesperson for the special counsel’s office declined to comment on the investigation or the uptick in sealed indictments. Sealed indictments are often used in cases where a defendant is overseas and U.S. prosecutors don’t want to tip off their target before they have a chance to make an arrest. But they can also be used to pressure someone to flip on a more important target, according to Kendall Coffey, who served as U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida in the mid-1990s, “especially if there was someone who presented the hope of providing proactive assistance – undertaking conversations, especially recorded conversations with other suspects in the investigation.” Mueller has used a sealed indictment before. The case against unpaid Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos remained a secret for three months before charges of lying to investigators were eventually made public in October 2017. Only then, after Mueller's team secured a cooperation agreement, did the public learn the one-time foreign policy advisor would be the first from Trump’s campaign to plead guilty in the probe. Brett Kappel, a veteran political law expert said he calculated that 16 percent of all the criminal cases filed thus far in 2018 remained under seal, a number he considered “unusually high.” And those were kept under seal much longer than usual, he said. “They normally only remain sealed until the person who has been indicted has been apprehended,” he said. “The other major reason why a case is initially sealed is that publicly revealing the name of the accused would impede an ongoing investigation.” Coffey said he did not know if the stack of secret charging papers had any ties to Mueller. But if they did, he said, they would have enabled the special counsel’s team to keep cases moving ahead of the midterms. “If indeed Mueller had prepared cases for prosecution but did not want the announcement to impact on pending elections then a sealed indictment might have been the preferred method,” Coffey said. And there was good reason, Miller said, for Mueller to lock in charges before the midterms.     Mueller can only indict someone with the approval of the Attorney General, and once the indictments have been approved and filed, any effort to withdraw charges would involve a judge. At the time, those approvals fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia matter. But President Trump had sent strong signals he planned to replace Sessions after the elections with someone who might be more willing to curtail the probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion. The day after the elections, Trump appointed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has previously denounced the Mueller probe. A Justice Department spokeswoman said this week that Whitaker “is fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal.” “You can’t prevent a new AG from blocking new indictments,” Miller said. “But if you were ready to move on cases, you could return a bunch of indictments under seal. If the stumbling block is approval from Mueller’s supervisors, you get that approval while you still have a supervisor who approves of your work.” ABC News' Ali Dukakis and Soorin Kim contributed to this report. Editor’s note: This report has been updated to correct that there have been nearly three dozen, not more than three dozen, sealed criminal indictments added to federal court docket in 2018.

Before it was presented Monday in Washington, D.C. the tree hailed from Larry Smith's tree farm in the mountains of Newland, North Carolina. The tree nearly had a different fate, according to Smith. “I’d basically abandoned it,” Smith told the Charlotte Observer. However, he told the newspaper that two White House officials who chose the tree loved the “natural look” of the fir that had not been trimmed in a few years. “It’s like a Cinderella story,” Smith added. Smith did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.

It was his fifth try, according to the Avery Journal.   The tree was cut down on Wednesday and transported by flatbed truck to the White House presentation on Monday. Smith and his family were on hand to present this year’s tree to President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump. The tree will be displayed in the Blue Room of the White House this holiday season, according to the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group.   As is tradition, the tree arrived by horse-drawn carriage. The Marine band played Christmas-themed tunes as the president and first lady walked around the carriage, admiring the tree from all angles. The first couple also stopped to pose for a few photos with some onlookers. Having one of his trees selected as the White House Christmas Tree “is the most prestigious honor” he could ever receive, Smith told the Observer. “It’s like winning the Super Bowl,” Smith said.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/veterans-still-outpace-civilians-congress-declines-continue---split---Jason Crow, Democratic candidate for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District won his election Tuesday. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file) The number of military veterans in both chambers of Congress will at best remain unchanged despite a midterm cycle featuring dozens of candidates with military experience on both sides of the aisle. Seventy-four veterans won House seats Tuesday night. Eight others were locked in races still too close to call Wednesday afternoon. In the Senate, a projected win for retired Air Force office Martha McSally in an Arizona race would bring the number of veterans in the next Congress to 17 — the same number that finished the 115th Congress. Even if veterans win all the outstanding races in the House, the percentage of House lawmakers with military experience will remain unchanged: 19 percent. That’s a disappointing performance for veterans’ advocates who had hoped to see an end to nearly 50 years of decline for veteran representation in Congress. However, the number of female veterans, Democrats with military experience and younger veterans with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan will rise. But the percentage of veterans in Congress is still higher than the greater population, just 8 percent even after almost two decades of war. Veterans offered an antidote to divisive politics and a deadlocked Congresses in campaign commercials that highlighted their combat experience as evidence they could work across party lines and get things done in times of conflict. Such characterizations are not supported by data, said Lindsey Cormack, a political scientist and author of “Congress and U.S. Veterans: From the GI Bill to the VA Crisis.” “There is no evidence that once they get to Congress, veterans are more bipartisan than anyone else,” she said. Rather, she attributed the large number of veterans on the ballot Tuesday to “smart politicking.” “A lot more people are asking vets to run,” she said. The reason, she added, is simple: “When you look at public opinion polls, people don’t trust politicians, lawyers, scientists but they do trust veterans,” she said. Advocacy groups said veterans were well positioned to appeal to voters on a wide range of issues and gain the trust of voters who consistently rank military officers among the most honest and ethical professionals. Dan Caldwell, Executive Director of Concerned Veterans for America, said veterans from both parties campaigned on policy issues important to their constituents instead of expecting to stand out solely based on their military experience, a mistake candidates made in previous cycles. “They had more developed and well-thought-out policy platforms,” he said. CVA, is a non-profit in the Koch brothers’ political network and a vocal critic of the Veterans Affairs administration. Josh Soltz, chairman of VoteVets, which supports Democratic veterans running in Congress, said veterans were uniquely positioned. “This cycle is about winning in red America, and winning in districts that Democrats used to have.” he said. “This election is defined on Donald Trump, whether you are with him or against him or whether you want to stop his agenda. I think veterans will play a real role in stopping what he wants to do.” He pointed to candidates such as Democrat Jason Crow, who defeated incumbent Mike Coffman in Colorado’s 6th District. Democrats targeted Coffman for several cycles. But Crow, a first-time candidate, was able to appeal to women in red parts of the district, which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and tie Coffman to Trump at every turn. Another example, he said, is Mikie Sherrill, a Navy veteran and former prosecutor, whose win Tuesday night represents the first time a Democrat will represent New Jersey’s 11th district since 1985. Veterans will bring their personal and military experience to bear on a number of defense-related issues in the 116th Congress, including potential budget cuts at the Pentagon, the fallout from President Trump’s decision to deploy the national guard — a cost of $200- to $300 million — to stop a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border, and debate over the Trump administration’s attempts to restrict transgender and immigrant service in the military. Danielle Lupton, a Colgate University political science professor who has studied veterans in the House, said military experience tends to influence lawmakers’ votes on certain issues. When there are more veterans in Congress, she said, lawmakers are less likely to support the use of military force abroad. Veterans in Congress are also more likely to exert oversight over the president’s use of power in foreign policy than non-veterans, she said. “It doesn’t matter if the president is of their party or not,” she said. “They will still increase oversight of war operations and try to put checks on presidential power.” The new class of veterans also reflects the broader success of Democrats on the midterm ballot with 23 wins. (Five more await results in contests not called by publication time.) That comes after a period of decline in Democratic representation among veterans. During the Obama era, veterans were divided about evenly between Democrats and Republicans. But in the last Congress, about 80 percent of Congressional veterans were Republicans, Cormack said. At least four female veterans have won their races, bringing the total number of women with military experience to ever serve in Congress to eight. The number of lawmakers with military experience peaked at 75 percent in the House in 1967 and at 81 percent in the Senate in 1975, after conscription pushed larger percentages of the American into military service, according to the Pew Research Center. At the end of the 115th Congress, there were 77 veterans in the House and 17 in the Senate, according to data compiled by CQ. Air Force veteran Denver Riggleman, a Republican who will replace Rep. Tom Garrett in Virginia’s 5th District, agreed that foreign policy is an area where he and his veteran colleagues “will probably shine.” “There’s an operational experience element to this,” Riggleman said. “There’s a sobriety that comes to that, that when you put people in harm’s way, there better be a darn good reason — because you’ve been there yourself.” More than 170 veterans appeared on midterm ballots Tuesday, with years of service dating back to the 1950s. The candidates represented both parties: Sixty-two Democrats, 109 Republicans and one independent. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

In this Q&A, Michael Dimock, president of Pew Research Center, talks about recent developments in public opinion polling and what lies ahead. There’s a widespread feeling that polling failed to predict the 2016 election results. Do you agree? President Trump’s victory certainly caught many people by surprise, and I faced more than one Hillary Clinton supporter who felt personally betrayed by polling. But the extent to which the expectation of a Clinton victory was based on flawed polling data – or incorrect interpretation of polling data – is a big part of this question. Polling’s professional organization, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), spent the last several months looking at the raw data behind the pre-election polls in an attempt to answer this question. (Note: The leader of the AAPOR committee tasked with this inquiry is Pew Research Center’s director of survey research, Courtney Kennedy.) While it might surprise some people, the expert analysis found that national polling in 2016 was very accurate by historical standards. When the national polls were aggregated, or pulled together, they showed Clinton winning among likely voters by an average of 3.2 percentage points. She ended up winning the popular vote by 2.1 points – a relatively close call when looking at presidential polling historically, and significantly closer than what polls suggested in 2012. Of course, as we all well know, the president isn’t chosen by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College – so it is the state poll results, rather than the nationwide surveys, that were particularly relevant for those trying to project election results. And the state polls, according to the report, “had a historically bad year.” In particular, in several key Midwestern states with a history of voting Democratic at the presidential level – including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania – Clinton was narrowly ahead in pre-election polls, only to be edged out on Election Day. So what happened? The AAPOR committee report offers at least two factors that were at play. First, data suggests that a number of voters made up their minds in the final days of the campaign. And those late deciders broke for Trump by a significant margin. In the battleground of Wisconsin, for example, 14% of voters told exit pollsters that they had made up their minds only in the final week; they ultimately favored Trump by nearly two-to-one. Yet nearly all of the polling that drove expectations of a Clinton victory in Wisconsin was conducted before the final week of the campaign, missing this late swing of support. Secondly, unlike in other recent elections, there was a stark education divide in candidate support that some state-level polls missed. Pollsters have long talked about the importance of gender, religion, race and ethnicity as strong correlates of voter preference. Last year, education was also a strong correlate. A number of pre-election polls that didn’t account for it – by adjusting, or “weighting,” their samples to better reflect the full population – were off if they had too many highly educated voters, who tended to vote for Clinton, and too few low-education voters, who tended to vote for Trump. What does that all mean? Well, polls may have been an accurate representation of voter preferences at the time they were taken. But preferences can change, particularly in a fast-moving campaign. Combine that with an education gap that wasn’t apparent in other recent elections – and wasn’t reflected in some state-level surveys – and you can see why some of those state polls did a poor job of projecting the ultimate outcome. The key for survey practitioners is that both these types of errors can be addressed by known methods. If polls can get election outcomes wrong, doesn’t that mean polling in general is unreliable? No. There are important differences between election polling and other kinds of survey work. Forecasting elections doesn’t just involve asking people whether they support candidate A or candidate B. It also involves trying to determine whether respondents will act on their preferences by casting a ballot at all. And that extra step of identifying “likely voters” has long been one of the most challenging things for pollsters to do. Survey respondents generally do a better job of telling you what they think than what they are going to do, especially when it comes to voting. It is this extra step – where a lot of assumptions about factors associated with turnout need to be made – that is quite distinct from the principles of random sampling and good question design that make survey research valid and reliable. Another wrinkle when it comes to election polling is that we’re now in an era when the aggregation of polls emphasizes their use specifically as a forecasting tool, and asserts degrees of certainty to those forecasts. This is much like the weatherman using a variety of tools to forecast the weather. But I don’t think this is the primary, or even a good, use of polling. In fact, most survey work is not engaged in election forecasting. Instead, it’s meant to get beyond the surface and into people’s heads – to truly understand and explain their values, beliefs, priorities and concerns on the major issues of the day. These kinds of surveys are aimed at representing all citizens, including those who might not vote, write to their member of Congress or otherwise participate in the political process. After each election, there is a tendency for the winning candidate to claim a mandate and point to the results as evidence of the public’s will. But given that so many citizens don’t vote, and that many who do vote don’t like either of the options before them, elections aren’t necessarily reflective of the will of all people. A deep, thoughtful survey can help address this disconnect by presenting the voice of the public on any number of issues. Let’s talk about response rates. In recent decades, fewer people have been responding to telephone surveys. Does that mean poll results are becoming less accurate? We spend a lot of time worrying about declining response rates. There is no doubt that the share of Americans who respond to randomized telephone surveys is low and has fallen over time – from 36% of those called in 1997 to 9% in 2016. A low response rate does signal that poll consumers should be aware of the potential for “nonresponse bias” – that is, the possibility that those who didn’t respond may be significantly different from those who did participate in the survey. But a Pew Research Center report released last month shows that survey participation rates have stabilized over the past several years and that the negative consequences of low response rates for telephone survey accuracy and reliability are limited. In particular, there’s no evidence that Democrats or Republicans are systematically more or less likely to participate in telephone surveys. There’s also a misperception that the rise of mobile phones is a problem for survey accuracy, but it’s not. To be sure, mobile phones are a factor: It’s now estimated that roughly 95% of U.S. adults own a mobile phone, and more than half live in households that have no landline phone at all. To meet this reality, the Center conducts the majority of interviews – 75% – via mobile phones. And we’ve actually found that it has improved the representativeness of our surveys by improving our ability to reach lower-income, younger and city-dwelling people – all of whom are more likely to be mobile-only. Has “big data” reduced the relevance of polling, or will it in the future? Calling a sample of 1,000 to 1,500 adults may seem quaint in the new world of big data. Why even collect survey data when so much information already exists in the digital traces we leave behind as part of our daily lives? While it’s possible that some of the more straightforward tasks that polling had traditionally provided – like tracking candidate popularity, consumer confidence or even specific brand images – might eventually be tracked by algorithms crunching massive public databases, for the foreseeable future getting beyond the “what” to the “why” of human behavior and beliefs requires asking people questions – through surveys – to understand what they are thinking. Big data can only tell you so much. And the existence of big data doesn’t equal access to data. While researchers could potentially learn a lot about Americans’ online, travel, financial or media consumption behaviors, much of this data is private or proprietary, as well as fragmented, and we don’t yet have the norms or structure to access it or to make datasets “talk” to other sources. So rather than feeling threatened by big data, we see it as a huge opportunity and have made some big investments in learning more. We’re particularly interested in work that tries to marry survey research to big data analytics to improve samples, reach important subpopulations, augment survey questions with concrete behaviors and track changes in survey respondents over time. The future of polling will certainly be shaped by – but probably not replaced by – the big data revolution. What is the future of polling at Pew Research Center? We were founded by one of the giants of the field – Andy Kohut – and have built much of our reputation on the quality of our telephone polls. But we are also an organization that has never rested on its laurels. We spend a lot of time and money taking a hard look at our methods to make sure they remain accurate and meaningful. I remain confident that telephone surveys still work as a methodology, and the Center will keep using them as a key part of our data collection tool kit. And I’m particularly proud that the Center is at the forefront of efforts to provide the data to test their reliability and validity, with no punches pulled. But we aren’t stopping there. For example, we now have a probability-based online poll that accounts for about 40% of our domestic surveys. We tap into lots of government databases in the U.S. and internationally for demographic research. We’ve got a Data Labs team that is experimenting with web scraping and machine learning. We’ve used Google Trends, Gnip and Twitter, ComScore, Parse.ly, and our own custom data aggregations to ask different kinds of questions about public behaviors and communication streams than we ever could with polls alone. All in all, this is an interesting time to be a social scientist. There are lots of big changes in American politics, global relationships, media and technology. Our methods will continue to change and evolve in response. At the end of the day, though, our obligation remains the same: to gather the public’s opinions reliably and respectfully, to analyze and assess what people tell us with the utmost care, and to share what we learn with both transparency and humility.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Mississippi Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith’s Democratic opponent Mike Espy slams her ‘public hanging’ remark as ‘reprehensible.’ With the recounts over and the races in Florida and Georgia finally decided, the nation's attention is shifting to another southern state. In what is the last battle of the 2018 midterm season, a special runoff election is taking place in just over a week to decide who will fill Mississippi’s second seat in the Senate. The runoff pits Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith against her Democratic challenger, former Secretary of Agriculture and ex-Democratic Rep. Mike Espy. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed in April to fill retired Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's seat, and Espy beat out two other candidates earlier this month, but neither was able to accumulate more than 50 percent of the vote to win the race outright. Now the runoff is drawing national attention – and money – in a competitive contest that could see Espy become the state’s first Democratic senator since 1962. Before the November 6 elections, polling showed Hyde-Smith enjoying a sizeable lead over her three contenders in the deeply red state, but on Election Day she garnered only 41.4 percent of the vote with Espy close behind at 40.7 percent. Since then her campaign has run into some public relations issues after two videos surfaced in the last week of her making questionable comments. In one video, the senator says that if she were invited by one of her supporters to a "public hanging," she would be in "the front row,” while in the other she is heard telling a group of supporters that “there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who that maybe we don't want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. So, I think that's a great idea.” While her campaign has said her comments were "an exaggerated expression of regard” and “all a joke,” both have upset many in a state known for its history of lynchings and other racially-motivated attacks on African-Americans. Her opponent, Espy, is African-American. Mississippi also has the highest percentage of black residents – at 37 percent – and community leaders have heavily criticized the senator for her comments. “Hyde-Smith’s decision to joke about ‘hanging,’ in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African Americans is sick," NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. "To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people, Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful. Any politician seeking to serve as the national voice of the people of Mississippi should know better." Hyde-Smith’s comments have become prime fodder for the political action committees that have funneled millions of dollars into helping Espy win the Senate seat. FILE - In this Aug. 2, 2018, file photo, Mike Espy, a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary, speaks at the Neshoba County Fair, one of the state's largest political events, in Philadelphia, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File) One PAC in particular, PowerPACPlus, has latched on to Hyde-Smith’s “hanging” comments by putting out an ad that features a 1930 photo of a white crowd in Indiana posing around a tree as the lifeless bodies of two black men hang above them, lynched in nooses. The ad then superimposes an unrelated photo of Hyde-Smith alongside the “This is where U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith would like to be.” PowerPACPlus has also given ESPY’s campaign around $1.8 million. To combat the bad press, Hyde-Smith’s campaign and national Republican leaders are pulling out all the stops to make sure she retains her seat come January. President Trump is making two stops in Mississippi the day before the special election – in Tupelo and Biloxi – to rally voter support for Hyde-Smith as he did for a number of other candidates across the country in a mad dash of appearances before Nov. 6. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Mississippi by almost 18 points and remains popular within the Magnolia state. “President Trump is so committed to getting out the vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith that he scheduled two rallies in the great State of Mississippi on the day before the run-off election,” Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner said in a news release. “The President needs all hands on deck on Election Day on November 27 so he can continue to count on Senator Hyde-Smith’s outstanding support for his America First agenda.” Along with the presidential support on the stump, the Hyde-Smith campaign is also receiving a sizeable financial bump from the GOP, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee expected to spend more than $1 million on a TV ad blitz. Despite the cash infusion and Hyde-Smith’s missteps, Espy is not even close to a guaranteed win in next week’s runoff. Mississippi is still a deeply conservative state overall and even more so when it comes to the people in the state who vote. To that end, Espy is trying to rally African-American voters to head to the polls once again in November to cast their ballots for him. Espy – who has played off Hyde-Smith’s “hanging” comment while on the campaign trail – hopes to use those voters, along with any crossover Republicans put off by the comment, to win the race. "Here's what you're not going to get from me: You're not going to hear any talk about voter suppression. You're not going to hear any talk about public hanging," Espy said on Sunday. Before the Nov. 6 elections there were a number of parallels drawn between the Senate race in Mississippi and last year’s special election that saw Democrat Doug Jones defeat the scandal-plagued Republican Roy Moore to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed attorney general. Some critics at the time balked at the comparison as Hyde-Smith’s record was squeaky clean, but with two high-profile missteps emerging in the last week, the question remains, does that change anything? “Cindy Hyde-Smith is giving Espy some freebies with those comments,” Marvin King, a political science professor at the University of Mississippi, told Fox News. King noted that Hyde-Smith’s comments have heightened the attention on the race and energized some voters appalled by her words – both helpful to Espy. But will it be enough to turn Mississippi blue? “I don’t think so,” King said. “It will change nothing in the aggregate, but maybe some things on the margins.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. First lady Melania Trump reportedly wants Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel fired. The two allegedly clashed during Trump’s trip to Africa. First lady of the United States is a hard job. It’s not formally defined yet entails many demands; it has an impact on history but no formal powers; it’s the focus of all eyes, but people like to make it clear nobody elected you. Its locus is the East Wing, which the West Wing considers the silly place. You must be guided by tradition but be open to novelty so no one accuses you of being boring. Melania Trump has been a figure of sympathy, at least in this space, lauded for her grace, elegance and stoicism. She’s married to a man who, emotionally and intellectually, is not exactly in the middle of the bell curve. She wound up in a job she never particularly wanted, in a time of unprecedented national division. She has done it pretty well. She has brought chic, American glamour and beautiful manners to the world’s capitals. (There was the “I Really Don’t Care Do U?” jacket, but at least that was spirited.) She humbly presented a gift in a Tiffany box to the Obamas on Inauguration Day, while her husband forgot to help her out of their car. She has self-control, and the independence to disagree with her husband -- when she said separating families at the border is no good, when she stood up for LeBron James after the president called him stupid. She’s slapped his hand away when he gropily attempts to portray normal unity. She’s put up with many scandals, some personally mortifying. So it was a surprise to see her issue a hissy-fit of a statement about the deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.” Yowza. Granted, Ricardel’s public reputation suggests she’s quite a blunderbuss. But Mrs. Trump’s statement added to -- and included her in, for the first time -- the White House’s reputation for chaos, the sense that nobody’s in charge, that it’s all factions, head-butting and rumors about who’s going to get fired next. Wednesday Politico had a quote from an unnamed former White House staffer describing the atmosphere: “It’s like an episode of ‘Maury.’ The only thing missing is a paternity test.” To continue reading on The Wall Street Journal, click here.

---split---4.0---split---http://www.latimes.com/essentialwashington/#nt=secondarynavbar---split---Follow our coverage of the midterm elections here. Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington. Our coverage of California politics is here. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for the free politics newsletter Sixteen House Democrats said Monday that they will vote to deny Rep. Nancy Pelosi another stint as House speaker, a show of defiance that puts her opponents on the cusp of forcing a seismic leadership shake-up as their party prepares to take the majority. Their pledge to oppose Pelosi (D-San Francisco), both in an internal caucus election and a Jan. 3 floor vote, delivered in a letter sent to Democratic colleagues, comes as Pelosi has marshaled a legion of supporters on and off Capitol Hill to make her case. But her opponents said Monday they are convinced it is time to select a new leader. Three Senate Democrats filed a lawsuit Monday arguing that Acting Atty. Gen. Matthew Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and asking a federal judge to remove him. The suit, filed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, argues that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution because he has not been confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker was chief of staff to Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and was elevated to the top job after Sessions was ousted by President Trump on Nov. 7. Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott says incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson called him to concede defeat in their extremely tight race. Scott issued a statement Sunday saying Nelson "graciously conceded" their Senate race shortly after the state's recount ended. The final results show Scott defeated Nelson by just over 10,000 votes out of 8 million cast. Nelson is scheduled to release a videotaped statement later Sunday. The defeat ends Nelson's lengthy political career. The three-term incumbent was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000. Before that he served six terms in the U.S. House and as state treasurer and insurance commissioner for six years. Gil Cisneros defeated Republican Young Kim on Saturday in the last of Orange County’s undecided House races, giving Democrats a clean sweep of the state’s six most fiercely fought congressional contests and marking an epochal shift in a region long synonymous with political conservatism. For a party in freefall the last two decades, California Republicans learned that it's possible to plunge even further. Congresswoman-elect Katie Porter said she plans to support Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid for speaker of the House and will make campaign finance reform her top priority when she enters the chamber in January. “I'm going to continue to have conversations, but so far I feel like Leader Pelosi is definitely making the things that were a priority to the families that elected me her priorities, including announcing her support for campaign finance reform and anti-corruption as HR1," Porter said in her first public appearance since being declared the winner in California’s 45th Congressional District on Thursday evening. “It means a lot to me that she is a Californian. She understands our state,” Porter added. “When we talk about environmental protections, this is a person who understands as a Californian how fragile our environment is and what's at risk in things like drilling off our coasts." President Trump says he will name the Environmental Protection Agency's acting head, Andrew Wheeler, to the post permanently. Trump made the announcement almost in passing Friday at a White House ceremony for Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees. The president singled out Wheeler in the audience at the ceremony, adding Wheeler "is going to be made permanent" at EPA. Florida’s acrimonious battle for the U.S. Senate headed Thursday to a legally required hand recount after an initial review by ballot-counting machines showed Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson separated by less than 13,000 votes. But the highly watched contest for governor between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum appeared to be over, with a machine recount showing DeSantis with a large enough advantage over Gillum to avoid a hand recount in that race. Gillum, who conceded the contest on election night only to retract his concession later, said in a statement that “it is not over until every legally casted vote is counted.” Democrat Gil Cisneros pulled ahead of Republican Young Kim in one of California’s undecided congressional races Thursday, an ominous sign for a GOP already reeling from its loss of four House seats in the state. In updated vote counts released by the registrars for Orange and San Bernardino counties, Kim fell 941 votes behind Cisneros in the contest to succeed Republican Rep. Ed Royce in California’s 39th Congressional District. The 39th straddles Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties. In another unresolved House race, Democrat Katie Porter pulled further ahead of Republican incumbent Mimi Walters in the 45th District, which includes Mission Viejo, Tustin, Irvine, Rancho Santa Margarita and Laguna Hills. Unofficial Florida election results show that the governor's race seems to be settled after a machine recount but the U.S. Senate race is likely headed to a hand recount. Republican Ron DeSantis is virtually assured of winning the nationally watched governor's race over Democrat Andrew Gillum. Florida finished a machine recount Thursday that showed Gillum without enough votes to force a manual recount. Unofficial results posted on a state website show the margin between U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Gov. Rick Scott is still thin enough to trigger a second review. State law requires a hand recount of races with a margin of 0.25 percentage point or less.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  In Washington, power is fleeting. Elected and appointed officials know they better use it before they lose it. In the House of Representatives, Republicans are going to lose it Jan. 3 when they become the minority party. The change in power that GOP representatives will experience will be dramatic – like Superman turning into Clark Kent or Wonder Woman turning into Diana Prince. Voters elected a Democratic majority to the House in the Nov. 6 midterm elections, ending uninterrupted Republican control of the chamber that last began in 2011. With a few races still undecided, Democrats have flipped at least 35 seats held by Republicans. This gives the Democrats the ability to elect a new speaker of the House and install Democratic chairs to head every committee. While the Senate will remain under Republican control in January, legislation needs to be approved in both the Senate and House to become law. So Republicans have only a short time left to pass bills during their lame duck session and get them to President Trump so he can sign them. This task is more complicated than it sounds, because Republicans have plenty of disagreements with each other. But they would be foolish to let their differences prevent them from making progress on important measures in the next few weeks. Republicans need to play chess and not Russian roulette with the Democrats. There is an opportunity to horse trade or to jam Democrats if Republicans adopt the ancient advice that “united we stand, divided we fall” and think strategically. I urge Republicans to work long days and into the night for the remainder of this year to pass as many measures as they can, not kicking the can down the road to the next Congress where Democrats will be empowered. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may need Republican votes to be elected speaker of the House, because some Democratic insurgents are saying they won’t support her bid. The Democratic rebels are giving Republicans leverage over Pelosi to demand that she agree to some GOP priorities – like funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as other spending measures – in return for their support. The idea is that it is better to deal with the devil you know than what could come next. I urge Republicans to work long days and into the night for the remainder of this year to pass as many measures as they can, not kicking the can down the road to the next Congress where Democrats will be empowered. Republicans should be able to get bipartisan support for measures like a budget resolution needed to avoid a government shutdown, permanent repeal of the medical device tax, and a multibillion-dollar program to fund infrastructure expansion and improvement projects. Then there are heavier lifts like immigration reform, border wall funding, tax cut 2.0 to target the middle class, and the Holy Grail – a full and complete repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. Republicans should not squander the opportunity to lead – the sand is almost through the hourglass. For many representatives who lost their seats in the midterm elections, action and results could be a great legacy as they exit stage right. Republicans should have no regrets as this year ends and not give up the fight in 2019. Democrats cannot govern alone next year. If Democrats act in good faith and heed the electorate that is sick and tired of bitter partisanship they will get things done. Democrats would be wise to resist the temptation to get even for past grievances and the urge to engage in endless, pointless and fruitless investigations. What Democrats need to realize and accept is that President Trump is transactional – not an entrenched ideologue. He wants to make deals and say he is winning, but on the other hand he will not be taken advantage of. So the choice is clear. Republicans need to lead in the lame-duck session and Democrats need to help where they can or get out of the way. Then when a new Congress arrives in January, Democrats need to reach across the aisle to advance legislation for the good of the country. Democrats should remember that when President Clinton and President Obama suffered heavy midterm loses they still managed to get re-elected, in part because of the behavior of the opposition party and the way Republicans obstructed instead of governed. Many Democrats in Congress have tied themselves to the delusional and obsessive anti-Trump “resistance” movement. They need to remember that they weren’t elected to come to Washington to stage protests and reflexively oppose everything the president and GOP lawmakers propose. This is especially true for some of the young and far-left Democrats who call themselves democratic socialists and who support massive increases in government spending to fund a laundry list of expensive government programs. Voting for these measures means voting for big tax increases or unsustainable deficits that are likely to anger voters in 2020. I believe President Trump can lead Republicans to compromise with Democrats in the House and Senate for the remainder of this year and in 2019, but it will take three to tango – the House, Senate and White House. The lame-duck session should operate under the motto of “Lead or get out of the way.” The 2019 congressional session should operate under the motto of “Let’s make a deal.” And Republicans who Pelosi turns to for support should ask: “What’s in it for us?” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

---split---4.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mattis-defends-militarys-border-support-mission-visiting-troops/story?id=59191508---split---Defense Secretary James Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of active duty troops to the border with Mexico Wednesday, calling it "a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen." While visiting with some of the soldiers deployed to the southern U.S. border, Mattis said "border security is part of national security" and stressed that the military mission is strictly to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection as it prepares for the arrival of four migrant caravans in the coming weeks.    "It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen," Defense Secretary James Mattis says as he travels to visit U.S. troops deployed to the southern border in anticipation of the arrival of a migrant caravan heading toward the U.S. https://t.co/AfEIFrfeM5 pic.twitter.com/MQlF3O3bJ6 On Wednesday, Mattis visited Camp Donna, a large, newly-constructed camp outside of McAllen, Texas that was built to house 1,000 soldiers and their equipment. He was accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who oversees Customs and Border Protection, and Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command.    THE MISSION: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Donna, Texas, to inspect work by some of the thousands of soldiers deployed by Pres. Trump to protect against the migrant caravan. https://t.co/NOWAZjh1ON pic.twitter.com/3lMzu6cDju  As of Wednesday, there were 5,900 troops deployed on the border. More than 7,000 active duty troops are expected to be fully deployed in Arizona, California and Texas ahead of the arrival of the migrant caravans. "The eyes of the world, and certainly all of the Americans, are on you," Mattis told soldiers during his tour of Camp Donna. Some military analysts have speculated that the deployment could end up costing as much as $200 million, but Mattis told reporters traveling with him that he was not able to provide a preliminary cost estimate because the information was still flowing into the Pentagon. "So we can estimate costs all we want," said Mattis. "I prefer to give you real costs." Four migrant caravans were making their way through Mexico to the U.S. Several hundred migrants from the first caravan arrived in Tijuana on Tuesday where they are expected to rest and receive legal advice before approaching the border crossing at San Ysidro to request asylum. Last week President Donald Trump signed an executive order that only allowed asylum requests to be made at formal ports of entry, a change of existing law that allows asylum requests anywhere on the border. Migrants from a caravan that left Mexico City earlier this week and are now headed to the border crossings near Tijuana, 1,500 miles to the northwest. That was a change from the expected route to McAllen and Brownsville, Texas, a much shorter distance. Mattis acknowledged the location of the caravans arrival was a "dynamic situation" but said "we can move the troops back and forth." "Right now the only thing we’ve been asked for is to put in obstacles, provide transportation and to provide housing," said Mattis, reiterating that the soldiers' mission along the border is one of support. "I do not anticipate military personnel coming into direct contact with migrants," said Mattis. "I’m a hundred percent confident we have the number of troops at each of those ports of entry to complete what we’ve been asked to do prior to the arrival of the large caravans."  Defense Sec. James Mattis says U.S. troops deployed to the southern border will not be "directly participating in any law enforcement" at this time. "At the present I do not anticipate military personnel coming into direct contact with migrants," he adds https://t.co/AfEIFrfeM5 pic.twitter.com/zLYMFCCVAh  Additionally, the only military personnel who will be armed are the military police providing security to the military support units. “The service members there in an engineering capacity who are building barbed, wire and barriers are not armed," said Mattis. Military police watching over these engineers, he said is part of normal force protection.   The military deployment became a politically charged issue in the lead-up to the midterm elections with Democrats questioning whether it was necessary and if Trump was using the military for political gain. While campaigning, Trump regularly referred to the U.S. military mission to help deal with the migrant caravans which he labeled as an "invasion." But since the election, the president has not mentioned the border mission publicly or on social media. He has also not used the term "invasion."   Last week, Mattis instructed that the name "Operation Faithful Patriot" be dropped and instead refer to the deployment as a border support mission. He explained he did not want to risk misinterpretation by using military terminology to describe a mission supporting another agency. "I do not want to put this mission in some arcane military terms if what we are doing is laying wire," said Mattis. "I want to talk to the American people because this is a highly politically visible issue and I want you to tell them what you’re doing."  Defense Sec. James Mattis on why name of Pentagon mission on southern border changed from "Operation Faithful Patriot" to a border support mission after midterms: "I had given instructions I do not want to put this mission in some arcane military terms" https://t.co/6K48bZHhCY pic.twitter.com/RNIp4uJbQq 
---split---5.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-finished-answering-muellers-questions-submitted/story?id=59248079---split---President Donald Trump said Friday he has finished his written answers to special counsel Robert Mueller for the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, but told reporters he has yet to submit the answers to Mueller's office. "I write the answers. My lawyers don't write answers," Trump said during a cybersecurity initiative bill signing in the Oval Office. "I was asked a series of questions, I answered them very easily." Pressed on his tweet storm Thursday in which he accused Mueller's investigators without evidence of going "absolutely nuts," the president assured reporters that nothing of note triggered his tirade but that it was a “continuation” of the objections he’s already raised with the probe.     "No, I'm not agitated. It's a hoax," he said.  The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don’t...   ....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!  "There should have never been any Mueller investigation because there was never anything done wrong," Trump said. "There was no collusion -- there never has been." "The witch hunt, as I call it, should never have taken place," he said. "It continues to go on. I imagine it's ending now. From what I hear, it's ending. And I'm sure it will be just fine. And you know why it's going to be just fine? Because there was no collusion."     While he repeatedly stated that his legal team has not been involved in helping him write his responses to Mueller, Trump expressed concern over investigators looking to catch him perjuring himself.   "I was asked a series of questions. I've answered them very easily. Very easily, He said. "I'm sure they're tricked up, because, you know, they like to catch people -- 'Gee, you know, was the weather sunny or was it rainy?" "He said it may have been a good day; it was rainy, therefore he told a lie. He perjured himself.' Okay? So you have to always be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions." Several former Trump campaign officials, including Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, have pleaded guilty to providing false statements to the FBI after their interviews with investigators.

In response, CNN dropped its lawsuit against the Trump administration. “Today the @WhiteHouse fully restored @Acosta’s press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,” said CNN in a terse statement Monday. A rep for the White House did not immediately respond to request for comment from TheWrap.

In restoring Acosta’s credentials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders laid out new “rules” in an email Monday afternoon, saying that going forward, reporters would be allowed to ask only “one question” and that follow-ups would be determined at the president’s discretion. Anyone who violates the new rules would be subjection to revocation of their press credentials.  SARAH SANDERS says that Acosta's press pass has been restored, sets new explicit standards of conduct for POTUS press conferences, and warns that they will do so for press in other non-public areas if they must. I pic.twitter.com/Q3FB0kTsPP — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) November 19, 2018  Earlier this month, the White House yanked Acosta’s credentials after the CNN reporter refused to back down from a series of tough questions about the migrant caravan during an East Wing press conference. “CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN,” Trump exploded at Acosta during the Nov. 7 press conference. “The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. The way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn’t treat people that way.” By that evening, Acosta’s press pass had been suspended and CNN filed suit a short time later. The network was presumed to have a strong case and an early ruling from federal Judge Timothy Kelly — a Trump appointee — had restored Acosta’s pass for two weeks. Acosta was pleased with the restoration of his credentials and said “let’s get back to work” in a tweet.  Thanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday… let's get back to work. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 19, 2018  Read original story Jim Acosta’s Press Credentials Restored by White House; CNN Drops Lawsuit At TheWrap John: Trump stopped Acosta from attending, I didn't see or hear where he stopped CNN from sending someone else in. 1.8k

---split---5.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/cnn-seeks-hearing-white-house-again-vows-yank-160629894.html---split---WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CNN on Monday called on a federal court to hold emergency proceedings after the White House said it would again revoke press access to correspondent Jim Acosta despite a temporary restraining order on Friday to reinstate him. Acosta's credentials were revoked after Trump denounced him as a "rude, terrible person" during a Nov. 7 news conference. CNN challenged the move in court and on Friday won a ruling that temporarily reinstated Acosta while the court considers the news network's lawsuit over the ouster. In a filing on Monday, CNN and Acosta asked for an expedited hearing next week after top White House communications officials told Acosta in a letter late on Friday that it had already decided to suspend his press once the two-week restraining order expires. The White House opposed the request for an emergency hearing, and asked for more time to respond to the court. "Not only is there no 'emergency' right now, it is impossible to know at this point whether next steps are necessary, much less what those steps should be," it wrote in a court filing. It said the White House expected to make its final decision on Acosta credentials by 3 p.m. EST on Monday. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who is presiding over the case, gave the White House until 6 p.m. EST on Monday to give the court an update. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders and White House communications chief Bill Shine had earlier told Acosta that it had made a "preliminary decision" backed by Trump. When Kelly temporarily restored Acosta's credentials, the judge said the White House had failed to provide due process. He did not address any alleged violations of free speech, protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Trump, who has long blasted the media and often targeted Acosta, said on "Fox News Sunday" the judge's decision was "not a big deal" and that the White House would establish rules for the press. Asked what they would entail, he said: "We're going to write them up right now ... we'll have rules of decorum, you know, you can’t keep asking questions." Despite the filing, Acosta and CNN said they "remain hopeful" the dispute could be resolved outside of court, they wrote. At the contentious news conference a day after Trump's Republicans lost their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Trump erupted into anger when Acosta questioned him about the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and a migrant caravan traveling through Mexico.

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democratic-senators-sue-trump-whitaker-appointment---split---Matt Whitaker was appointed acting attorney general by President Donald Trump after Jeff Sessions was asked to stepped down. (Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call file photo) Three Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, asking a federal court to stop him from leading the Justice Department. Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Mazie K. Hirono of Hawaii argue in the case that President Donald Trump’s move to name Whitaker temporarily as the nation’s top law enforcement official violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. If allowed to stand, “Mr. Whitaker’s appointment would create a road map for the evasion of the constitutionally prescribed Senate advice-and-consent role,” the senators argue in the lawsuit. Trump has said there is “no rush” to name a new attorney general, and the Justice Department has concluded the move is legal and constitutional. Whitaker is the first acting attorney general who has not received Senate confirmation since 1866. “The U.S. Senate has not consented to Mr. Whitaker serving in any office within the federal government, let alone the highest office of the DOJ,” the Democratic senators state in the lawsuit. Whitaker will be able to exercise all the powers of the attorney general for as many as 210 days and potentially many more, the senators wrote, and that unlawfully denies legislators their right to cast an effective vote and robs them of their core powers and responsibilities. The Senate in the confirmation process would have the opportunity “to consider his espoused legal views, his affiliation with a company that is under criminal investigation for defrauding consumers, and his public comments criticizing and proposing to curtail ongoing DOJ investigations that implicate the President,” the lawsuit states. As acting attorney general, Whitaker also has “vast ability to shape whether and how the laws enacted by Congress are enforced and the money appropriated by Congress is spent,” the lawmakers state. The senators ask for a declaratory judgment that Whitaker and Trump are violating the Constitution, and an order to prevent him from acting as attorney general. The case is Blumenthal, et al. v. Whitaker, et al., U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Docket No. 18-cv-02664.

Drinking too much "The norm is the more you drink the more you eat," Cox said. "After one or two alcoholic beverages, you don't have the same sense of self-control and tend to overeat while you are still drinking." The body metabolizes alcohol before food because it is a toxin and the body wants to get rid of it, Fitzgerald added. "When this happens, fat oxidation stops and the metabolism of everything we're eating slows down, which can contribute to weight gain over time."

"We need to stop accepting that there isn't anything we can do about it," said David Jernigan, a Boston University public health professor who has researched alcohol for 30 years. Among ideas that have worked: raising taxes, restricting sales, upping treatment availability and teaching kids how to cope with stress and trauma without booze. Ron Byrd remembers losing his daughter Erika to complications of alcohol abuse, despite he and his wife June's best efforts. USA TODAY When it comes to Thanksgiving, microwaves are usually reserved for the leftovers. But many people are playing a fun prank on their parents by asking them how to cook a 25-pound turkey in the microwave, then sharing reactions. The responses so far? Priceless. Interestingly enough, you can indeed cook a whole turkey in the microwave. You just need a bird small enough to fit inside. A judge sentenced Christopher Watts, a suburban Denver dad, to three consecutive life terms in prison and 84 additional years Monday for the murders of his pregnant wife and two daughters. In Colorado, those with a life sentence are not eligible for parole. Watts, 33, strangled his wife, Shanann Watts, 34, before smothering daughters Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, and disposing of their bodies in an oilfield. The motive, per Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke: Watts' wanted a new life with his girlfriend. Watts was arrested Aug. 15, one day after he pleaded for his family to come home in an emotional TV interview. "Prison is too good for you," Shanann Watts' dad, Frank Rzucek, said at the hearing.

Mandy Moore and Dawes lead singer Taylor Goldsmith have tied the knot. Federal circuit courts field 50,000 cases a year. The Supreme Court, by comparison, handles about 70. That's why President Trump has appointed regional judges at a record clip — 29 so far, more than one per month in office. And those moves could reshape issues such as gun control, affirmative action and religious freedom. But the appointments some call Trump's crowning achievement may slow down during his third year. Why? Liberal judges aren't retiring, leaving fewer vacancies. And with Trump as president, one conservative group says, those judges may not want to budge.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reporters-defend-cnn-jim-acosta_us_5be3ae6be4b0e84388935da9---split---Fellow journalists and members of the White House press corps came to the immediate defense of CNN’s Jim Acosta on Wednesday after the Trump administration revoked his press credentials. Acosta was involved in a fiery exchange with President Donald Trump during a lengthy, post-election news conference at the White House earlier Wednesday. After repeatedly asking the president questions, provoking a heated outburst, an intern stepped forward to try to take a microphone from the CNN reporter as he moved to evade her. Within hours, Acosta said the Secret Service had denied him entry to White House grounds and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed the reporter had placed his hands on the young woman. President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern... That account prompted a full-throated outcry from many political journalists. The White House Correspondents’ Association, a coalition of the reporters who cover the executive branch, released its strong objections to the move, calling the decision “out of line” and “unacceptable.” WHCA statement on White House decision on credentials. pic.twitter.com/bukK7CGu2G “Journalists may use a range of approaches to carry out their jobs and the WHCA does not police the tone or frequency of the questions its members ask of powerful senior government officials, including the president,” the group wrote. “Such interactions, however uncomfortable they may appear to be, help define the strength of our national institutions.” The group urged the White House to “immediately reverse this weak and misguided action” and encouraged the public to watch the video of Acosta’s interaction with the intern. Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, said the move was a “very bad sign” and something he had “never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996.” If this is a decision by the White House because it doesn't like the coverage, it's the first time I can remember this happening to any reporter since I started covering the White House more than 22 years ago. Very bad sign. https://t.co/VNPDua0dZn “Other presidents did not fear tough questioning,” Baker wrote on Twitter, noting that Trump may have intentionally called on Acosta to lash out. “If he really thought [Jim] was unfair, then why did he call on him? Because he wants the confrontation.” Reuters’ White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who said he was seated next to Acosta, said he did not see his colleague “‘placing his hands’ on the young intern.” Others called the move “incredibly concerning,” said it simply “didn’t happen” or noted that the administration was likely trying to manufacture a “fresh controversy for the base” following the midterm elections. The WH is now denying @Acosta access to the WH grounds do his job. This is incredibly concerning. https://t.co/lnZICQIGim They need a fresh controversy for the base too. https://t.co/RIwa7H1Sqh This is wrong and deeply concerning. https://t.co/8fAE2eC9Uc The thing about this White House is that, over and over again, they choose to lie in order to justify wrong and stupid decisions, knowing the press will get worked up over the lie and the base will either believe it or not care about it at all. First part is questionable, second part didn’t happen. https://t.co/t4DSrxuX6W Even Ben Shapiro, a notoriously conservative commentator, defended the CNN journalist, writing back to Sanders that her account was “not what happened.” “You could have banned him simply for refusing to abide by any of the normal rules of the press room,” Shapiro wrote. “No need to state something that didn’t happen.” This is not what happened. You could have banned him simply for refusing to abide by any of the normal rules of the press room. No need to state something happened that didn’t. https://t.co/p9hgtVE8eZ Other reporters noted that even though, as the BBC’s Jon Sopel put it, Acosta may be a “royal pain in the ass” for Trump, he was just doing his job. Well this is not complicated. @PressSec has patently misrepresented what happened here. White House aide aggressively tries to take the mic from @Acosta and he never lays a hand on her. The truth still matters. https://t.co/MsWwlTGTd2 This is dumb. And disproportionate. @acosta may be royal pain in ass - but that’s our job. We’re not sent to ask easy questions. But can’t help feeling this is a shiny object thrown for the media to chase when far more important things are happening. https://t.co/tAlcg2FqR1 Watching the video below, it does not appear that @Acosta was “placing his hands” on this female intern, as the White House claims https://t.co/QkSasv3qdl This is a complete lie. The woman grabbed Jim's arm repeatedly. He never once touched her. In fact at one point @Acosta tells her politely "pardon me, mam" as she's yanking on his arm. https://t.co/Mfh3Ol5Q46 Despite the criticism, Sanders doubled down on the White House’s decision late Wednesday evening, releasing a video on her Twitter account that played a moment from the encounter on a loop, slowing down and zooming in on the footage. “We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,” she wrote. We stand by our decision to revoke this individual’s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video. pic.twitter.com/T8X1Ng912y CNN stood by Acosta, sharing the same video interaction “for the world to see” on Twitter. “This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better,” CNN said in its statement. “Jim Acosta has our full support.” Here is a video of the interaction for the world to see: pic.twitter.com/us8u5TWzDz Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-climate-change-views---split---President Donald Trump indicated Saturday that his views on climate change and those of California Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newson are “maybe not as different as people think.” (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) President Donald Trump on Saturday stopped just shy of saying he believes climate change is a legitimate scientific phenomenon, a statement that likely would not sit well with his conservative base and most GOP lawmakers. “We have different views but maybe not as different as people think. Things are happening. Things are changing,” he said aboard Air Force One in California, flanked by Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom. Both are Democrats who believe in climate change. Trump’s views on the issue have vacillated wildly over the years. He has called it a hoax and acknowledged changes are occurring — but insisting in October that weather patterns will eventually “switch back.” “And I think most importantly we’re doing things about — to make it better,” he said Saturday. “We’re going to make it a lot better.” Trump, who often describes himself as a one-man fixer for just about any problem, did not provide examples.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-mexico-border-troops-caravan_us_5bf337d2e4b0376c9e67e213---split---The troops President Donald Trump sent to the border ahead of the elections earlier this month will reportedly soon be leaving, in spite of continued flows of asylum-seekers and other migrants coming to the United States. Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is overseeing the troop deployment at the border, told Politico on Monday that the Pentagon will begin heading home as soon as this week after completing the tasks of fortifying ports of entry and building base camps. “Our end date right now is 15 December, and I’ve got no indications from anybody that we’ll go beyond that,” Buchanan told Politico. Pentagon spokeswoman Laura Seal said in an email to HuffPost that she had no details on redeployment to announce at this time, but that troops “have made significant progress in closing gaps and hardening points of entry” and are authorized to support Customs and Border Protection until Dec. 15. Buchanan said troops had completed many of their tasks, such as placing concertina wire and other barriers, which meant many engineers would not need to stay much longer. Troops involved in logistics will also be able to depart now that base camps have been built, while helicopter pilots, medical personnel and engineers who can help close traffic at ports of entry will stay on longer, Politico reported. Still, the reduction in troop levels now ― after Trump largely stopped tweeting or talking about the caravans post-midterm elections, but while thousands of migrants are still en route to the U.S. ― is likely to bolster critics who said the deployment was more about pre-election fear-mongering than responding to a need. The Trump administration announced plans to deploy thousands of active-duty troops to the border in late October, amid the president’s frequent campaign refrains and tweets about incoming migrant caravans. Officials insisted it wasn’t a stunt, although the number of troops to be sent exceeded the first caravan’s numbers at that time and the military is barred from conducting immigration arrests. Trump said at one point that he might send as many as 15,000 troops to the border, but as of last week, had deployed about 5,900. The mission was initially called “Operation Faithful Patriot,” but the Pentagon dropped that name after the midterm elections, opting to refer to it as supporting border efforts instead. “We determined the missions as absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers, it’s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,” Defense Secretary James Mattis said last week. On Monday, Department of Homeland Security officials said security at the border is still very much at risk. Customs and Border Protection closed down northbound traffic at a port of entry in San Ysidro, California, for three hours ― ending around 6:25 a.m. ― on Monday after receiving intelligence that some migrants were considering rushing through lanes for automobiles. There are between 8,500 to 10,500 migrants currently seeking to go to the U.S., about 6,000 of them waiting to cross in San Ysidro, officials told reporters during a briefing call on Monday, declining to be quoted by name. Asylum-seekers are encouraged to go to ports of entry to ask for help, but are often forced to wait weeks or months to do so because the U.S. government admits only a limited number at a time for processing. DHS officials argued that agents at ports of entry have other responsibilities beyond screening asylum-seekers. Although migrants could previously seek asylum either at ports of entry or after entering illegally, Trump took action earlier this month to bar those protections for anyone who crossed the border without authorization. That was meant to “funnel” asylum-seekers to ports of entry, according to officials. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued to block the policy and argued in court on Monday for a preliminary injunction. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---5.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-look-new-dccc-chair-protect-majority---split---Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., is one of four candidates competing to lead the DCCC next cycle. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) For the first time, House Democrats are competing in an open race to lead the party’s campaign arm next cycle. And the new leader’s responsibilities will include something no predecessor has faced in a decade: protecting their chamber majority. The race to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is currently a four-way contest between Reps. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, and Denny Heck and Suzan DelBene of Washington. The DCCC chairmanship was an appointed position until 2016, after Democratic losses led to demands for changes at the committee. Current DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján is running for assistant Democratic leader. Having made historic midterm gains, especially in some tough districts, the candidates are making their cases through the next two weeks for why they can protect — and even expand on — this year’s successes. They previewed their arguments in brief interviews with Roll Call on Wednesday. Also Watch: Democrats Divided on Pelosi as Speaker After First Post-Election Caucus Meeting All four candidates were elected in 2012, and they’re all members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition. Although several have touted their ability to win in tough districts, each member’s 2018 re-election race was rated Solid Democratic by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Bustos is a familiar face at the DCCC. She most recently served as chair of heartland engagement, a new position to which Luján appointed her in the summer of 2017. She formerly chaired the committee’s Red to Blue program for its strongest recruits and was a vice chair of recruitment during the 2016 cycle. She’s known for mentoring candidates, often traveling to campaign for female and Midwestern recruits. As one of the co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, she’s currently the only elected member of leadership from the Midwest. She dropped out of the race for assistant leader to pursue the top job at the DCCC. Maloney dropped a challenge to Luján after the 2016 election, instead conducting an extensive review of the DCCC’s inner workings. After losing the primary for state attorney general in September, he went on to win a fourth term in a district north of New York City. Heck and DelBene both had top roles in the DCCC in 2018. Heck led the committee’s recruitment effort, while DelBene was its finance co-chair. DelBene, a former Microsoft executive, came to Congress in a special election. She’s also the vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition. Both Bustos and Maloney represent districts that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and a major part of their pitches is that they know how to win in Republican-leaning areas. “That’s what I lived and breathed since I’ve been elected,” Bustos said Wednesday. “I’ve increased my margin from 6 to 10 to 20 to 24. … It’s the biggest margin in the country for a Democrat in a Trump district.” While Trump won her 17th District by less than a point, Bustos hasn’t had a competitive opponent the last two cycles. Last week, she defeated a Republican who had raised $27,000 by mid-October. (Bustos banked $3.7 million). Her 2016 opponent had raised about $12,000 at the same point in the cycle. Bustos stressed that there shouldn’t be a uniform approach to holding Trump districts, but basic things such as constituent services and outreach to non-Democrats was important. Bustos is known for her “Supermarket Saturday” and “Cheri on Shift” programs in which she engages with constituents. She’s also piloted a bootcamp in her district to train Democrats to run for local office. Her geographic appeal may be enough to win over some members who’d like to see more representation in leadership beyond the coasts. “I will default to my region,” said Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who’s often been critical of her party for not paying enough attention to the heartland. Maloney similarly argued that his status as a Democrat in a Trump district means he’s well-equipped to lead the DCCC. After winning close races in 2012 and 2014, he has easily won his next two terms, vastly outspending his GOP opponents. But that’s only part of his pitch. Maloney also said he knows the committee best after completing a monthslong review of the DCCC’s inner workings. And he said he has the best relationship with New York City and national donors. Heck and DelBene, the first candidates to jump into the race, have both touted their roles in the DCCC. Heck said Democrats would still target races they came close to winning in 2018, but also recognized that they needed to shift to a defensive posture. He cited recruitment, field operation, and Luján’s ability to work with members as key to the Democrats’ success. “I’m essentially pledging to my colleagues that I will continue in that tradition — double down on it in many regards,” he said. Heck also said it was important for the DCCC to coordinate with the caucus’s official messaging and leadership to bolster first-term members. HE said he was “fully committed” to conducting a review of the DCCC’s 2018 activity to evaluate what could be improved. DelBene alluded to her experience in the private sector as a manager and suggested she’d be able to help the party utilize new technology to connect with voters who don’t watch TV or answer their phones as much as they used to. DelBene was a member of the DCCC's Frontline program for vulnerable members during her first re-election in 2014, and said her experience in a “swing district” qualifies her for the role. DelBene won a fourth term by 18 points last week. Shifting from the minority to the majority also means the campaign committee will be focusing more on defending its members — many of whom were just elected in competitive districts. Several incoming freshmen surveyed Wednesday remained undecided on who should lead the DCCC. But some offered advice on how the committee should approach 2020 — mainly that the new chair should listen to them. “The most important thing is … that they articulate how they’re going to help newly elected members and learn the lessons that they learned from winning their races,” Rep.-elect Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said. California Rep.-elect Katie Hill also said the new DCCC leaders should listen to the class of 2018, while adding that she would lean toward supporting a female candidate in this race and other leadership contests. Former Rep. Steven Horsford, who won a comeback bid in Nevada’s 4th District, said he wants the new DCCC chair to continue to prioritize turning out low-propensity minority voters, who were key to his victory. While Democrats will have a presidential race boosting turnout in 2020, Horsford noted there wouldn’t be a gubernatorial or Senate race in Nevada doing the same — a similar scenario to when he lost his 2014 re-election. “I don’t want to repeat that experience ever again. Neither do I want any of my colleagues after winning the majority to have to go through that either,” Horsford said. “So we need a chairman who understands that and who has a strategy and who has a commitment to put the resources in early.” Correction: A previous version of this story stated DelBene was a member of the DCCC's Frontline program in 2018.

---split---5.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/democrats-score-marine-veteran-challenge-poliquin---split---Democrat Jared Golden is taking on two-term GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine’s 2nd District. (Courtesy Jared Golden campaign.) Democrats have landed a top recruit in a rural Maine district where candidate profiles matter — even more so than most places. State House Assistant Majority Leader Jared Golden, a Marine veteran, announced his candidacy for the 2nd District in Lewiston’s Kennedy Park Thursday morning. He’s taking on two-term GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whom Democrats have spent millions trying to portray as a Wall Street guy who only returned to the state to seek political office. (Poliquin was born and raised in Maine.) [Bruce Poliquin: Energizer Bunny?] Golden attacked Poliquin’s vote for the GOP health care bill in his campaign launch, drawing an implicit contrast between the congressman’s vote and that of GOP Sen. Susan Collins, for whom Golden once worked in Washington, D.C. Golden faces an uphill battle against the well-financed incumbent in a district President Donald Trump won last fall. But Democrats are excited about the native Mainer’s chances to connect with white, working-class voters who have moved away from the Democratic Party in recent years. [As Maine’s 2nd District Goes, So Goes the Nation?] Golden, 35, grew up in Leeds, a town of just over 2,000 people in central Maine. He joined the Marines in 2002, serving combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Golden graduated from Bates College, also in the 2nd District, in 2011. After volunteering in Afghanistan, he went to work for Collins on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Elected to the state House in 2014, Golden was elected assistant majority leader in 2016. He represents part of Lewiston, an old mill town on the Androscoggin River that makes up the major population center of the 2nd District. Democrats have made an effort to recruit veterans across the country in their quest to win a House majority in 2018. And Golden has been in close contact with Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who’s spearheaded that effort. Golden’s service in the Marines features prominently in his announcement video. Golden also praised Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, vice chairwoman of recruitment for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and former Rep. Michael H. Michaud for their help. Shortly after announcing, Golden climbed in his truck on Thursday to embark on a four-day tour of the district, part of which will include “Jared on the Job” stints. He’ll work on a farm in northern Maine and haul lobster traps in Jonesport. Golden’s also attending house parties, where he’s hoping to hear from voters about where the Democratic Party has gone astray. Golden refused to weigh in on the party’s leadership fights in D.C. Asked whether he’d support Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi if elected to Congress, he demurred. “I honestly don’t think Mainers care that much about parlor games,” Golden said. “They’re focused on jobs, and I’ll support the leader who shows me that’s their priority.” [When House Challengers Have Their Districts to Themselves] But Poliquin’s vote on health care, as well as his refusal to tell anyone how he was going to vote, Golden said “was just awful.” Poliquin, 63, has earned plenty of negative headlines for dodging questions from reporters and constituents. But he’s twice overcome Democrats’ attempts to portray him as an out-of-touch businessman who doesn’t fit the 2nd District. Poliquin’s team was quick to criticize Golden Thursday morning. "Young Jared Golden looks good on the surface but diving deeper you find an extreme Augusta liberal politician," campaign adviser Brent Littlefield said in a statement. "Golden has consistently voted against needed welfare reforms, he voted to support illegal immigration sanctuary cities, socialist bureaucratic healthcare, and Golden even earned a D rating from the NRA for opposing Maine’s sportsmen and 2nd Amendment rights," Littlefield added. Democrats relished the attack on Golden’s age, taking it as a sign that Poliquin is nervous. "I’d ask Brent what he was doing 15 years ago when I was fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq," Golden said. As for his record on gun rights, Golden defended his support for background check legislation and said he recently voted for a bill that bans the creation of a gun registry in Maine. "I’m a Marine Corps infantryman. I don’t think Brent Littlefield should question whether or not I’m comfortable with a rifle," Golden added. The Maine GOP went after Golden’s announcement, saying "his statements are simply out-of-touch and not true." Executive Director Jason Savage defended Poliquin’s “fight against unfair trade deals” and the opioid epidemic. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the 2nd District race Likely Republican. Democrats targeted this district heavily in 2016, when they recruited 2014 Democratic candidate Emily Cain for a rematch. Poliquin had defeated her by 5 points in 2014. But Poliquin, a member of the Financial Services Committee, proved an impressive fundraiser for a freshman. [EMILY’s List Names Maine’s Emily Cain Executive Director] Meanwhile, Trump’s brand of populism went over well in the 2nd District, even among lifelong Democrats. President Barack Obama carried the district in 2008 and 2012. But Trump appealed to the same demographic that helped twice elected controversial Republican Gov. Paul LePage. Although Hillary Clinton won Maine, Trump won the 2nd District by 10 points, picking up one electoral vote. Poliquin defeated Cain by 10 points that year. No incumbent has lost this district since 1916. [Before Donald Trump, There Was Maine’s Paul LePage] But the race could look different if Poliquin runs for governor. He hasn’t yet made a public announcement about running for re-election. But he’s continuing to raise money for his federal campaign account, which he couldn’t use for a gubernatorial bid. Poliquin ended the 2nd quarter with nearly $1.2 million. Golden won’t have the race to himself. Democrat Tim Rich, a Bar Harbor restaurateur, announced his candidacy earlier this month and will be kicking off his campaign with a rally this weekend. Former state Senate candidate Jonathan Fulford is also running for the Democratic nod. The owner of a Monroe construction business, he narrowly lost 2014 and 2016 races to state Senate President Michael Thibodeau. Dexter mail carrier Phil Cleaves and Islesboro bookseller Craig Olson are also running. Golden didn’t sound concerned about the primary. “I’m the first candidate, on day one of launch, who has Poliquin’s attack dog out,” Golden said. “That says something.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

We’re not allowing people to come in.” Trump’s comments came a day after the general in charge of the border deployment said 5,239 active-duty troops would be heading to the border with more potentially to follow, in addition to the 2,092 members of the National Guard already there. It wasn’t clear whether Trump’s 15,000 figure included the National Guard deployment. If the deployment reaches 15,000 troops, it would be roughly equivalent to the size of the U.S. military’s presence in Afghanistan and three times the size of the presence in Iraq. Already, the deployment is believed to be the largest of its kind in more than a century. “The number of troops deployed will change each day as military forces flow into the operating area, but the initial estimate is that [the Defense Department] will have more than 7,000 troops supporting DHS across California, Arizona and Texas,” U.S. Northern Command said in a statement issued shortly after Trump spoke. Critics say the president’s decision to announce the deployments just days before the election is a political stunt designed to fire up a base concerned about immigration. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, rejected the criticism on Tuesday, saying the military was deploying to support the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. “The support that we provide to the Secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police, so we don't do stunts in this department,” Mattis said. [Border deployment puts Mattis and the military in political crosshairs] The defense secretary said the military had carried out similar missions within the United States following natural disasters. “We are there in support of the Secretary of Homeland Security, who needs additional military assistance,” he said. A retired Marine Corps general, Mattis has long prioritized protecting the military from politicization, regularly emphasizing the apolitical traditions of the American armed forces. Deploying forces domestically in relation to such a politically charged issues risks eroding the public support that the armed forces enjoy with the American public. Officials in Washington say that if thousands of migrants make it to the border and attempt to force their way through a crossing, the military will be needed and should be in place well in advance. The officials also hope the deployment will help deter the caravans from proceeding. Two caravans, each with more than 3,000 travelers, are trailed by at least two other groups of several hundred migrants. Many are fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras and intending to seek asylum in the United States. At the speed they are moving, they are weeks away from the border. The military’s active-duty deployment, dubbed Faithful Patriot, will send planning teams to coordinate operations, helicopter companies to move around CBP personnel, engineer battalions to construct barriers and medical units to treat patients, according to U.S. Northern Command. The forces will also erect temporary housing to support CBP and military personnel. Northern Command, which is overseeing the deployment, has identified 13 bases in Arizona, California and Texas close to the operations area near the border that will serve as primary logistics hubs for the deployment. In addition, the command listed 38 units from 14 bases that had been identified to deploy to the southwest border. Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, estimated that a deployment of 15,000 active-duty troops through mid-December would cost from $90 million to $110 million. He calculated a 10,000-troop deployment of active-duty forces would cost about $60 million to $75 million. Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, commander of Northern Command, said Tuesday that he could not give an estimate of the operation’s cost.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.yahoo.com/news/jim-acosta-vs-trump-cnn-162751384.html---split---The White House is once again threatening to pull a CNN journalist Jim Acosta's press credentials after a temporary court order stopping them doing so expires at the end of the month. In response, the news network has called for another an emergency court hearing claiming the Trump administration is continuing to breach the constitutional rights of the First Amendment - free speech - and the Fifth Amendment, the right to due process. On Friday, District Judge Timothy Kelly temporarily restored Acosta's credentials for 14 days, saying the White House had failed to provide due process in removing Mr Acosta's pass over "inappropriate" behaviour at a press conference where he clashed with Donald Trump . The judge did not address any alleged violations of free speech, which will form part of the arguments in CNN's larger lawsuit over the move. In a letter later on Friday, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Communications Director Bill Shine sent Mr Acosta a letter stating the White House made a "preliminary decision" to revoke his pass once the order expired on 30 November. In a filing on Monday, CNN and Mr Acosta asked for an expedited hearing next week. “The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution,” the network said in a statement. “These actions threaten all journalists and news organisations. Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the president.” The White House opposed the request for an emergency hearing, writing in response to the court: “Not only is there no 'emergency' right now, it is impossible to know at this point whether next steps are necessary, much less what those steps should be.” It said the White House expected to make its final decision on Mr Acosta credentials by 3pm on Friday. Mr Acosta had been accused by the White House of getting physical with a press intern during a particularly tense 7 November exchange with the president as the young woman attempted to take the microphone back from the reporter. At the time, Ms Sanders tweeted out what appeared to be a doctored video, edited to show Mr Acosta pushing the woman’s arm away. “We will not tolerate the inappropriate behaviour clearly documented in this video,” she tweeted. The White House later appeared to drop that claim, merely saying that Mr Acosta had acted inappropriately in refusing to give up the microphone and trying to ask multiple questions. Mr Trump told Fox News on Sunday would have his pass pulled if he “misbehaves” again; “we’ll throw him out,” he added. Mr Trump said the court ruling issued late last week to reinstate Mr Acosta’s access was “not a big deal,” adding “what they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etc. etc. We’re doing that, were going to write them up right now”. Ms Sanders responded in a statement after the court's initial ruling on Friday that the White House will "further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future." CNN has been vocal in their defence of all journalists’ access to report from the White House. Mr Trump has frequently hit out at the network, calling it “fake news” and “truly dishonest...sick people”. His exchange with Mr Acosta was not an isolated incident. The president called several questions from female, African-American journalists in the White House press corps "stupid" and "racist" at various points that same week. The news network was also the recipient of two packages with explosive devices, addressed to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan - just two of a string of explosives sent to several prominent Democrats in recent weeks who were all vocal critics of Mr Trump.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/16/does-poll-include-or-exclude-nonvoters/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Courtney Kennedy and Claudia Deane The early days of a new presidential administration produce not just a blizzard of news but a blizzard of numbers. Pollsters of all stripes race to get and report Americans’ first impressions of their new president. But, frustratingly, those reports don’t always match up as precisely as the Type A among us might wish. Take the past three weeks of polling on President Donald Trump. Depending on the poll, Trump’s approval rating between Feb. 5 and 13 could have been as high as 53% or as low as 39%. So which was it? There are a number of possible reasons for polls arriving at different estimates – from the mode used to collect data to how people are selected for a survey – but here we’ll tackle one of the most basic: Did the poll include or exclude the 45% of adult Americans who didn’t cast a vote last November? Typically, polls in the U.S. are designed to represent one of three populations. The broadest is the general population of all adults (GP). Surveys based only on adults who are registered to vote (RV) apply a narrower lens on the public. Narrower still is the filter applied with surveys that interview only registered voters who are deemed likely to vote (LV). Many pollsters might conduct surveys of all three, depending on where they find themselves in the election cycle. In non-election years like this one, most pollsters survey all adults, but not all follow this convention. A number of pollsters continue to do surveys of registered or even likely voters. Why does this matter for Trump’s approval ratings? It’s about demographics. Voters as a group skew older and whiter than the general public. And older Americans, as well as white Americans, tilt more Republican than other groups. So, voter-only polls tend to get somewhat more favorable views of a Republican president or candidate and less favorable views of Democrats. This pattern was evident during Barack Obama’s presidency, with his overall ratings tending to be somewhat higher among the general public than among registered or likely voters. A look at some of the presidential approval numbers released this month shows a pattern consistent with these demographic differences. LV polls – those surveys based only on the views of “likely voters” – are generally reporting higher levels of support for Trump than general population polls. There is a more muted but still significant difference in an RV-GP comparison: Pew Research Center’s general population poll conducted Feb. 7-12 recorded Trump’s presidential approval rating at 39%. Among registered voters in that survey, his rating was 42%. So how many people are we including, or excluding, when we decide to look at the views of only registered or likely voters? In the U.S., roughly six-in-ten adults are registered to vote. The registration rate tends to tick up a few points in presidential election years (to about 65%) and back down a few points in non-election years. This means that RV polls, by design, exclude nearly 40% of adults living in the U.S. LV polls, of course, exclude even more, as they aim to include only those registered voters who actually cast, or will cast, a ballot. The voting rate among adults ages 18 and older was 55% in the 2016 presidential election and 33% in the most recent midterm election. If a pollster is currently conducting an LV poll with 2018 (a midterm election year) in mind, then recent midterm voting behavior suggests that their results might be excluding the views of a majority of adults in the U.S. Which population is appropriate – all adults, registered voters or likely voters – depends on what information the poll is intended to gather. For political operatives whose jobs (winning elections) require them to be in perpetual campaign mode, polls of registered or likely voters arguably provide the most accurate information about the mood and opinions of that subset of Americans who will actually cast a ballot in the next election. The fact that the poll excludes a large share of the population is a desired feature, not a bug. For those interested in the opinions and experiences of the entire country, as is the case here at the Center, general population polls are a more informative and useful tool. Nonvoters, like any other group of Americans, include people who pay taxes, want health insurance, run small businesses, use the public education or court systems and have a stake in the nation’s security – even though they do not play a role in selecting the officials who craft the public policies that affect them. While nonvoters do lean more Democratic than Republican, it would be a mistake to cast them as a partisan lot. Overall, they are much less likely than registered adults to identify with either major party (24% don’t lean toward either party, compared with 6% among voters). So polls that exclude nonvoters don’t just change the shade of the country’s partisan balance, they paint a portrait of a public that is distinctly more politically engaged and ideological than those that survey all adults.

A court order restored the pass, but the case is moving forward. Have presidents tried this before? USA TODAY CNN journalist Jim Acosta talks with reporters as he arrives at the White House after having his press pass restored, Nov. 16, 2018, in Washington. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) WASHINGTON – The White House backed down Monday from a fight with CNN over its decision to revoke the press credentials of reporter Jim Acosta, writing in a letter to the reporter that it made a "final determination" to give him back his badge. The White House also said it was establishing new rules for conduct at presidential press conferences. "Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules set forth above. The President is aware of this decision and concurs," the letter said. CNN had sued in U.S. District Court to get the press pass back, and dropped the case Monday after the White House decision. The new rules include limiting reporters to a single question each, with follow-ups permitted "at the discretion of the President or other White House officials." "We have created these rules with a degree of regret," said Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary. "We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference. But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules." The White House suspended Acosta's credential Nov. 7, after a contentious exchange with Trump during a news conference when the president called Acosta a "rude, terrible person." In response, CNN filed a lawsuit – backed by several media outlets, including USA TODAY – demanding the return of Acosta's credentials. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, granted the request and ordered Acosta's pass restored while the rest of the case played out. Kelly said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal. Later Friday, the White House sent CNN a letter that said Acosta's press pass could be revoked again right after a temporary restraining order granted by a federal judge expired after 14 days. But the letter Monday detailed several new rules for reporter conduct at presidential press conferences, including "a single question" from each journalist. Follow-ups will only be permitted "at the discretion of the President or other White House officials." Sanders said the new rules are: •A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists. •At the discretion of the president or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted. When a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor. •“Yielding the floor” includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner. •Failure to abide by any of rules may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass. "If unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision," Sanders said.

---split---6.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/rick-scott-declares-victory-florida-senate-race-still-uncalled---split---Florida Gov. Rick Scott held the hand of his grandson, Auguste, at his election night party in Naples, Fla. The Associated Press declared Scott the winner after a recount. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has conceded Florida’s Senate race to his Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott following a hand recount. “I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson, who graciously conceded, and I thanked him for his years of public service. This victory would not be possible without the hard work of so many people,” Scott said in a statement. “Now the campaign truly is behind us, and that’s where we need to leave it.” While there is a run-off still to come in Mississippi, the Scott win makes it most likely the Senate Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the 116th Congress. Much of the Florida suspense was, predictably, in Broward County, where the vote counting was rather slow and deliberate and a pattern of under votes in the Senate contest emerged. But as county officials worked through the hand recount ordered after the margin was within 0.15 percent statewide, it was clear Nelson couldn’t make up the deficit. The race was the most expensive Senate contest in the Sunshine State’s history. On election night, Scott came out to greet supporters in a resort ballroom in Naples shortly before midnight, and he declared victory even though Nelson had not conceded and the Associated Press had not yet called the race. “Now that this campaign is behind us, that’s where we’re going to leave it,” Scott said, saying the contest with Nelson had been “too nasty.” As it turned out, the nastiness was not quite over, with the two campaigns and their supporters continuing to trade barbs and accuse each other of trying to steal the election. Scott came to Capitol Hill to participate in post-election activities of the Republican Conference, including leadership elections. And his campaign took to referring to the outgoing governor as the incoming junior senator. Nelson and other Democrats, led by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, had been optimistic about the hand recount showing a different result. But, that was not the case. Schumer and Nelson had called for Scott to step aside from any role in overseeing the recount. “Gov. Scott needs to recuse himself from any involvement in the recount, and do it now. He’s a contestant in this election and can’t possibly be trusted to be a neutral, fair arbiter as the votes are tallied,” Schumer said Tuesday. Nelson went into Election Day with a slight lead in polling, with the conventional wisdom being that he was being boosted by enthusiasm for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum. Gillum, it turned out, did not have the coattails. Former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, was deemed the winner of the governor’s race before the actual resolution to the 2018 Senate contest. Scott and a super PAC he helped create spent millions of dollars on the Senate race, but the fact that the wealthy governor wasn’t able to put the race away over the summer gave Democrats confidence that the incumbent could hold on. Trump narrowly carried Florida in 2016, and national Democrats tried tying Scott to the president as well. Scott was one of the first Republicans to endorse then-candidate Trump in 2016, and Trump urged the two-term governor to run for Senate. Scott had worked to distance himself from the president and the national Republican Party of late on issues such as gun control and offshore drilling, though he made appearances with Trump in the closing days, as well as swings to events organized by groups of president’s supporters, like one with “Bikers for Trump” at a bar in Fort Lauderdale. Scott, a former health care executive, contributed $64 million of his own money to this race, including a $12.5 million contribution in the final weeks of the race. He’s worth $232 million and previously self-funded his two winning gubernatorial campaigns. Scott got a head start in this race, while Democrats fretted that Nelson was slow to build up a campaign and wasn’t doing enough to reach Hispanic voters. The three-term senator didn’t air his first TV spot until late August. Meanwhile, Scott and his allies pummeled Nelson on the airwaves in English and Spanish, attacking him for being in Washington for too long. Scott also benefited from earned media attention, especially as hurricanes ravaged the coast. But spending from outside Democratic groups kept him from running away with the race over the summer. As they have against Republicans elsewhere in the country, Democrats attacked Scott for his opposition to the 2010 health care law. The environment played a bigger role in the debate in this race than in most federal contests this year. Both Scott and Nelson went after each other for the red tide and blue-green algae crises, with both parties accusing the other of not doing enough, at either the federal or state level, to address the problem. The campaign arms of the League of Conservation Voters and the Environmental Defense Fund also spent for Nelson. Even Jimmy Buffett changed the lyrics to Margaritaville for a Gillum and Nelson campaign event. “Some people say that there’s a red tide to blame/ but I know, it’s Rick Scott’s fault,” Buffett sang in West Palm Beach on the Saturday before the election. But none of that was enough to get Gillum to the governor’s mansion or the incumbent senator a fourth term in Washington.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hans-von-spakovsky-acting-ag-matt-whitaker-has-no-conflict-of-interest-and-no-reason-to-recuse-himself---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Debate over acting attorney general pick's past remarks on the Russia probe. Under the ethics regulations that apply to Justice Department lawyers, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker has no conflict of interest. Hence, he has no ethical or legal obligation to recuse himself from supervising Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The demands that he do so are expressions of political theater with no factual or legal basis. Whitaker is being criticized for having voiced an opinion about Mueller’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. For example, on Nov. 11, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other congressional Democrats wrote the Justice Department’s designated agency ethics officer, complaining about Whitaker saying on June 9, 2017, that the “evidence was weak” and that there was no “criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had.” But Whitaker was legally correct then, and he is still correct today, about both of those assertions. Why? Because to date, the special counsel has publicly disclosed absolutely no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. The indictments released so far by the special counsel go to great lengths to point out that the alleged actions of Russian agents to use social media to inflame public opinion in 2016 were done without the knowledge of any individuals in any presidential campaign. In fact, the Russians used false and stolen identities to impersonate Americans. Not only is the evidence of any supposed collusion “weak,” it is nonexistent. Furthermore, according to two separate opinions issued in 1973 and 2000 by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted or charged. The 1973 opinion said a president cannot be prosecuted due to his “unique position under the Constitution.” The 2000 opinion added that, under our constitutional structure, only the House of Representatives “has the authority to bring charges of criminal misconduct through the constitutionally sanctioned process of impeachment.” Thus, according to Justice Department policy, neither Donald Trump nor any other president can be indicted for “criminal obstruction of justice.” Whitaker’s impartiality cannot be questioned when the opinions he voiced agreed—and still agree—with the facts and the law. Some legal scholars disagree with those opinions. However, the regulations under which Mueller was appointed require him to “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.” Thus, Mueller can’t file any obstruction of justice charges against Trump, no matter what he finds. Once again, Whitaker was correct: there is no “criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had” here. Whitaker has also been criticized for questioning Russian “interference” in the 2016 election. Certainly, the special counsel’s failure to publicly produce any evidence of collusion justifies some skepticism. Furthermore, Jeh Johnson, President Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Security, stated that there was “no evidence” of any tampering in the 2016 vote count by the Russians or anyone else. Although Whitaker was voicing his personal opinion, that opinion to date has not been shown to be wrong. All of these statements were made when Whitaker was not a government official and had no access to any of the nonpublic evidence gathered by Mueller. And none of these statements comes even close to requiring Whitaker to recuse himself under applicable regulations. He has no conflict of interest as outlined in those regulations because neither he nor any member of his family has any personal or financial interest in the outcome of the Mueller investigation. Some have reached even further to claim conflict, citing Whitaker’s support of Sam Clovis in a 2014 state political race. Clovis, who cochaired the Trump campaign, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. There is no evidence that, as required by the applicable regulation (28 CFR 45.2), that Clovis was “substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.” In fact, Mueller hasn’t turned up any unlawful conduct by the Trump campaign related to the election. Whitaker’s impartiality cannot be questioned when the opinions he voiced agreed—and still agree—with the facts and the law. The demands for recusal are baseless. Whitaker should be given the chance to do his job. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

---split---6.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-military-border-caravan_us_5bd78134e4b017e5bfd4df77---split---The Trump administration is sending at least 5,200 active-duty troops to the border this week in what officials said Monday is a necessary response to a roughly 3,500-person migrant caravan still weeks from reaching the United States. The troop deployment, dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot, was announced eight days before the midterm elections. But Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, dismissed accusations that the move is motivated by politics. “This is a law enforcement operation,” he said at a press conference. President Donald Trump has repeatedly condemned a migrant caravan making its way from Honduras to the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials are reportedly considering a dramatic crackdown on Central Americans and asylum seekers in response. But first, the administration is using the caravan to justify an eye-popping expansion in the military presence at the border ― even though the migrants are about 1,000 miles from the U.S., their numbers are already diminishing and many of those headed to the country are expected to seek asylum through a legally protected process at ports of entry. About 800 troops are already en route to help “harden” the border at and between ports of entry, and more will follow by the end of the week, said Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, who leads United States Northern Command, at the same press conference. They will join about 2,100 National Guard troops already there to assist CBP efforts. Taken together, that’s more troops deployed to the border to address a migrant caravan than there currently are in Iraq and Syria, according to The Wall Street Journal. “The president has made it clear that border security is national security,” O’Shaughnessy said. The U.S. military can’t carry out immigration arrests under law except in limited circumstances, but it is expected to assist border officers with various forms of engineering, medical and aviation support ― including identifying people crossing the border, constructing temporary barriers and providing medical services. Troops who are authorized to carry firearms will do so, O’Shaughnessy said. The migrant caravan is already shrinking. Once estimated at more than 7,000 people, it now numbers around 3,500, officials said. Still, the size of the caravan and potential for more to follow ― a second group of migrants tussled with both Guatemalan and Mexican police over the weekend ― calls for more preparations, McAleenan said. McAleenan said asylum seekers will still be able to request help in the same manner as before ― at least for now ― but he encouraged them to take up the offer from the government of Mexico to remain there instead. Many caravan participants have already registered for asylum in Mexico, and others are likely to stay as well, particularly after its president offered protections to those who chose to. Some experts expect only about 1,000 people to ultimately make it to the border, based on past trends. Trump claimed on Monday, without evidence, that gang members are part of the caravan, and called it “an invasion of our country.” “Our military is waiting for you!” he tweeted. Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you! CBP, which includes Border Patrol and officers at ports of entry, apprehended about 520,000 people on the southwest border last fiscal year, about 40 percent of whom were families and unaccompanied minors. Although total apprehensions were higher than Trump’s first year in office, 2018’s numbers aren’t unprecedented ― CBP apprehended more than 550,000 people in the 2016 fiscal year, for example, and more than 1 million in 2000. Nearly a quarter of those apprehended last year were picked up at ports of entry after being deemed inadmissible, a number that includes asylum seekers following a legal process. U.S. and international law allows people who fear persecution in their native countries to seek asylum. The administration has struggled to quickly deport those it apprehends because a larger proportion are Central American asylum-seeking families and children, who have more protections to have their claims heard before they can be sent back. Immigrant rights advocates argue that the border needs more resources to process asylum seekers, not more militarization. “President Trump has chosen just before midterm elections to force the military into furthering his anti-immigrant agenda of fear and division,” Shaw Drake, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union Border Rights Center in El Paso, Texas, said in a statement. “But this harmful action is nothing more than Trump’s latest aggression against immigrant families with children who seek our protection. These migrants need water, diapers, and basic necessities — not an army division.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. President Trump defends Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker as Democrats step up pressure over his appointment; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Three Democratic senators on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of President Trump’s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. Whitaker was appointed by Trump to lead the Justice Department after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out of the role earlier this month. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono filed the complaint against Whitaker in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday. All three issues fiery statements. “Installing Matthew Whitaker so flagrantly defies constitutional law that any viewer of School House Rock would recognize it. Americans prize a system of checks and balances, which President Trump’s dictatorial appointment betrays,” Blumenthal said. "The stakes are too high to allow the president to install an unconfirmed lackey to lead the Department of Justice – a lackey whose stated purpose, apparently, is undermining a major investigation into the president,” Whitehouse said. “Donald Trump cannot subvert the Constitution to protect himself and evade accountability,” Hirono said. The senators argue that Whitaker’s appointment is in violation of the Constitution’s appointments clause. They ask the federal court to declare Whitaker’s appointment unconstitutional and block him from carrying out duties. But the Justice Department maintains that the appointment is legal. DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Monday the appointment is “lawful” and comports with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the appointments clause of the U.S. Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, past Department of Justice opinions and past actions of Republican and Democratic presidents. “There are over 160 instances in American history in which non-Senate confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis, the duties of a Senate-confirmed position,” Kupec said. “To suggest otherwise is to ignore centuries of practice and precedent.” Last week, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion supporting Whitaker’s appointment. DOJ SAYS MATTHEW WHITAKER CAN SERVE AS ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL “This office previously had advised that the president could designate a senior Department of Justice official, such as Mr. Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General,” the OLC said, noting that Whitaker has been serving at the Justice Department “at a sufficiently senior pay level for over a year.” Others have filed lawsuits over the Whitaker appointment, including the state of Maryland. For more than a year, Trump repeatedly lambasted Sessions over his recusal from the Russia investigation, saying he wouldn’t have installed him as the country’s top law enforcement officer had he known his attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia probe. Democrats have expressed alarm about what the change at DOJ could mean for the Russia probe, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying, “protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount.” Other Democrats have called on Whitaker to remove himself from the Russia probe because of his past comments expressing skepticism about the scope and appropriateness of the probe. The Democratic senators are being represented by two non-profit law firms in the case: Protect Democracy and the Constitutional Accountability Center.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. New Fox News polling shows several Senate races are far from settled. A new round of Fox News battleground polls shows a Republican trend in the fight for the U.S. Senate. The GOP candidates are helped by increased interest in the election among Republicans and pro-Donald Trump sentiment. There’s been an uptick in GOP interest in all five states surveyed. Compared to early September, the number of Republicans feeling “extremely” interested in the upcoming election is up by 2 points in Arizona, up by 9 points in Indiana, up 8 points in both Missouri and North Dakota, and up 11 points in Tennessee. In each state, Republicans are now just as likely as Democrats to say they are extremely interested -- erasing an edge Democrats had in several states last month. The battle over Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court might explain increased interest in the election among Republicans. And how incumbent Senate Democrats vote on Kavanaugh could tip tight races, especially in Missouri and North Dakota. Voting against his nomination hurts more than helps the Democrats in those states. However, the races are far from settled. Only one of the Senate candidates has a lead outside the survey’s margin of sampling error. And that same candidate is also the only front-runner above the important marker of 50 percent support from their electorate. Starting with Arizona, here are the state-by-state results: Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema tops Republican Martha McSally by a 47-45 percent margin in the Senate race to fill the open seat of retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Last month, Sinema was up 47-44 percent (September 8-11). Sinema is helped by strong backing among women (+9 points), voters under age 45 (+14) and Hispanics (+29). She also enjoys greater party loyalty, as 91 percent of Democrats back her vs. 83 percent of Republicans for McSally. READ THE COMPLETE ARIZONA POLL RESULTS. However, McSally’s overall support is stronger, with 83 percent of her backers saying they are certain to vote for her compared to 71 percent of Sinema’s. Veterans prefer McSally, a retired Air Force pilot, by a 25-point margin. In addition, she leads among white voters (+5) and voters over age 45 (+4). The two candidates are about equally liked. For Sinema, 48 percent have a favorable opinion vs. 41 percent unfavorable. For McSally, it’s 46-45 percent. President Trump won Arizona by nearly four percentage points in 2016. That’s in line with his current job rating, as 51 percent of the state’s likely voters approve, while 47 percent disapprove. Indiana Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly tops Republican challenger Mike Braun by two points (43-41 percent), while Libertarian Lucy Brenton takes 6 percent. Eight percent are undecided. That’s a reversal from early September, when Braun had a two-point edge (45-43 percent). Men are more likely to back Braun by a 9-point margin, while women pick Donnelly by 11. READ THE COMPLETE INDIANA POLL RESULTS. Voters with a college degree support Donnelly by 10 points, while those without a degree go for Braun by 3 points. Strength of support is about equal: 77 percent of Braun’s backers say they are certain to vote for him. It’s 74 percent for Donnelly. If Donnelly votes against Kavanaugh, 30 percent say it would make them more likely to vote for him, 32 percent say less likely, and 34 percent say no difference. The Democrat announced he would vote against Kavanaugh on September 28, after Senate Judiciary Committee hearings that included testimony by Christine Blasey Ford on her sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. While Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 19 points in Indiana, today Hoosier voters approve of his job performance by just 6: 52 percent approve, while 46 percent disapprove. Missouri The Missouri Senate race is all tied up at 43 percent apiece for incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley, while other candidates garner 8 percent and six percent are undecided. Three weeks ago, McCaskill was up 44-41 percent (September 8-11). The survey also finds the race tied, 46-46 percent, in a hypothetical two-way matchup. READ THE COMPLETE MISSOURI POLL RESULTS. Suburban women (+15 points) and voters under age 45 (+6) are more likely to back McCaskill. The gender gap is somewhat diminished, as McCaskill’s advantage among women stands at 4 points, down from 9 points last month. Hawley has the edge among men (+5 points) and rural voters (+22). About three-quarters of both McCaskill’s (75 percent) and Hawley’s supporters (74 percent) feel certain they will back their candidate. McCaskill announced she would vote against Kavanaugh September 19, a week before Kavanaugh and Ford testified. Among the 28 percent of voters who say they could still switch candidates, almost twice as many say McCaskill voting against Kavanaugh’s confirmation would make them less inclined to back her. In general, voters have mixed views of both McCaskill (48 favorable vs. 48 unfavorable) and Hawley (47-45 percent). The president remains popular in the Show-Me State: a majority of 54 percent approves of the job Trump is doing, while 45 percent disapprove. He won Missouri by 19 points. North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this year, along with Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly. The survey shows Heitkamp may be in the most difficult position, as Republican challenger Kevin Cramer now leads by 12 points (53-41 percent). Last month, he was up by four (48-44 percent). READ THE COMPLETE NORTH DAKOTA POLL RESULTS. The shift comes mainly from declines in support for Heitkamp among women (was up by 7 points, now trails by 4), and voters with a college degree (was up by 7, now trails by 8). More Democrats back Heitkamp (94 percent) than Republicans back Cramer (87 percent), but in a state so red that Trump won by nearly 40 points, that isn’t enough. Strength of support is also with Cramer. Nearly 9 in 10 (87 percent) of his supporters are sure of their vote, compared to 8 in 10 Heitkamp backers (79 percent). Heitkamp remains undecided on Kavanaugh. If she votes against his confirmation, twice as many say they would be less likely (34 percent) rather than more likely (17 percent) to vote for her. By a 64-35 percent margin, likely voters approve of the president. That 29-point spread comes close to matching his 36-point margin of victory in 2016. Meanwhile, Republican Kelly Armstrong (51 percent) leads Democrat Mac Schneider (34 percent) by 17 points for the state’s only House seat, which Cramer vacated to run for Senate. Tennessee The president held a rally Monday in Johnson City, Tennessee. He won the state by 26 points, and voters there still love him. Likely voters in the Volunteer State approve of Trump’s job performance by 60-39 percent. READ THE COMPLETE TENNESSEE POLL RESULTS That helps put Republican Marsha Blackburn ahead of Democrat Phil Bredesen by a 48-43 percent margin. Blackburn’s 5-point advantage is inside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, she had a 3-point edge over Bredesen. They are competing for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Women go for Bredesen by 5 points, while men are more likely to pick Blackburn by 17. Among white men, her lead grows to 30 points. Bredesen stays in the game by garnering greater party loyalty (92 percent of Democrats back him compared to 82 percent of GOP for her), while also taking 10 percent of Republicans. About the same share of Bredesen (79 percent certain) and Blackburn (77 percent) supporters say they are certain to vote for them. Plus, roughly equal numbers have a positive view of both Blackburn (50 favorable vs. 41 unfavorable) and Bredesen (51-39 percent), who served as Tennessee’s governor from 2003 to 2011. Governor Pollpourri In the Arizona governor’s race, Republican incumbent Doug Ducey leads: 55 percent vs. 37 percent for Democrat David Garcia. One in five of Sinema’s supporters (20 percent) split their ballot and back the Republican, Ducey, for governor. By a 17-point margin, Tennessee likely voters back Republican Bill Lee (53 percent) over Democrat Karl Dean (36 percent) in the state’s gubernatorial race. Fourteen percent of those backing Bredesen in the Senate race defect to support Lee, the Republican, for governor. The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted September 29-October 2, 2018 by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among likely voters in Arizona (716), Indiana (695), Missouri (683), North Dakota (704) and Tennessee (666). Results based on the full sample in each state have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Registered voters were randomly selected from a statewide voter file (except in ND where all eligible voters were included), and respondents answered screening questions about their likelihood to vote in the November elections.

---split---7.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-bastions-democrats-gains-traditionally-conservative-districts/story?id=59217697---split---From Orange County, California, to rural Maine, to the congressional district that's home to one of President Donald Trump's golf courses, the Democratic majority that will preside over the 116th Congress will claim members from areas of the country once thought of as impenetrable bastions of conservatism and Republican dominance. While the laborious task of counting mail-in ballots delayed projections in many key California races, what once was a possibility has now become a reality for the GOP: they will have zero congressional representation in Orange County, once described by President Ronald Reagan as the place "where the good Republicans go to die." "Good Republicans," "Country Club Republicans," "Chamber of Commerce Republicans," whatever name is applied, in 2018 the GOP saw substantial losses in areas that birthed many of the figures and ideas that defined the modern conservative movement in America, seeing a sizable block of voters recoil at the tone and tenor of Trump, while Democrats were determined to register their disapproval of the commander in chief. "The results of the midterm show a continued disappearance of regional power by the GOP, as it becomes more and more centered in the South and rural America," ABC News Chief Political Analyst Matthew Dowd said. "It shows a continued homogeneity of the GOP where differences among the GOP caucus become fewer and fewer and looks less and less like America as a whole. Moderate GOPers have all but disappeared. So it not only becomes geographically concentrated but ideologically and demographically as well. It also means the possibility of nominating a candidate from either coasts or from urban areas is diminished."   According to ABC News projections, Democrats flipped all four Orange County-based seats, as Democrat Harley Rouda toppled 15-term incumbent GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, while the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa was won by Democrat Mike Levin.   As mail-in ballots across the state continue to be counted, Democratic candidate Gil Cisneros beat out Republican Young Kim to win California’s 39th District, home to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library. Earlier this week, Democrat Katie Porter defeated Republican Congresswoman Mimi Walters in the state's 45th Congressional District, which Hillary Clinton won by 5 points in the 2016 election. Prior to Clinton's narrow win in Orange County in the 2016 election, the area had not sided with a Democratic presidential candidate since 1936, when President Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a second term. Republicans also lost a seat partially located in the state's traditionally conservative Central Valley, and another in southern California, where Rep. Steve Knight, the only Republican representing any part of Los Angeles County in the House, lost to Democrat Katie Hill. When Congress is sworn in next year, Republicans will hold just eight of California's 53 U.S. House seats, or 15 percent of the congressional delegation in a state with nearly 40 million residents.   Half of New England re-elected their Republican governors in 2018, but after GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin was defeated by Democrat Jared Golden in Maine's 2nd Congressional District on Thursday (in part due to the state's implementation of ranked-choice voting) there will be exactly zero U.S. House members representing the region. Come January 2019, Maine Sen. Susan Collins will be the only Republican Member of Congress from New England.   In New Jersey, a state that elected and re-elected a Republican governor twice this century, Democrats flipped four U.S. House seats in 2018, leaving Rep. Chris Smith as the only Republican-member of the state's 12-person congressional delegation. In the state's 11th Congressional District, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the seat held by the retiring Republican chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a seat that had been in Republican hands since 1985. Republicans also now hold just 6 of the state of New York's 27 congressional seats after Rep. Dan Donovan lost re-election to his Staten Island-based seat and Representatives John Faso and Claudia Tenney were defeated by Democratic challengers in upstate New York. Democrats all flipped seats in suburban Atlanta and Chicago that once belonged to two former Republican House speakers, Newt Gingrich and Dennis Hastert, as well as the suburban Houston seat that was once held by former President George H.W. Bush. "America used to be a country of regional parties within each party, while both parties are on the path of losing this important representation, the path of the GOP is nearly complete to a nationalized ideological right-wing party," Dowd said. According to ABC News' current count, Democrats have a net gain of 37 seats in the U.S. House, with 2 races still undecided.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) trumpeted their work in California early and often this cycle, spending millions in the primary to ensure they got their candidates through the state's "Jungle Primary" system where the top two candidates advance regardless of party. It was a move that ultimately appears to be paying large dividends.   "The DCCC responded to this threat immediately in January 2018, conducting a thorough data analysis to determine the strongest and weakest candidates - both Democrats and Republicans - and working to consolidate the Democratic primary fields," DCCC regional press secretary Andrew Godinich wrote in a post-election memo recapping the DCCC's California strategy. But beyond surviving a unique primary system, the candidates that advanced and ultimately scored Democrats some of their most high-profile victories in traditionally conservative strongholds largely portrayed themselves not as partisans, but as pragmatists. Rouda, a former Republican and real estate developer, called for a "return to the middle" throughout his campaign. Sherrill, a former helicopter pilot in the U.S. Navy, joins a host of female veterans like Pennsylvania's Chrissy Houlahan, Virginia's Abigail Spanberger and Michigan's Elissa Slotkin, who all won victories in Republican-held seats in 2018, focusing both on their backgrounds and the issue of healthcare, a central part of the Democratic Party's messaging.   In one of the cycle's most impactful television advertisements, Slotkin highlighted her mother's struggles with the American healthcare system after a diagnosis of stage 4 ovarian cancer that eventually took her life, using footage of her Republican opponent Rep. Mike Bishop celebrating the House GOP's vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2017. Golden, a state legislator and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, ran on a platform of protecting Social Security and Medicare against an opponent that also voted to repeal the ACA.  While Democratic victories in areas once considered hallowed conservative garnered the most attention, on a macro-level, the party also outperformed the GOP in state's won by Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. According to an analysis by ABC News, while Republicans won just 36 of the 188 (19 percent) congressional seats in states won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, Democrats were able to capture 79 of the 245 seats (32 percent) up in states Trump won in 2016.   Democrats also now hold either a majority of half of the congressional seats in three Trump-won states: Arizona, Iowa and Michigan. The new Democratic majority also boasts representation from traditionally Republican states like Kansas, Oklahoma and South Carolina, which all backed Trump by wide margins and entered this cycle with all-Republican congressional delegations. But while those seats will likely return to the top of the GOP-target list in 2020, the ability of the party to compete in places like Orange County and the Northeast, at least in federal races, is in serious doubt. ABC News' Adam Kelsey contributed to this report.

Twitter erupted this weekend with mockery of the president after he claimed, during a visit to a scorched California town, that the leader of Finland had told him the Northern European country prevented wildfires in part by raking their forests. "You gotta take care of the floors," Trump said Saturday while touring Paradise, California, a town devastated by the Camp Fire, the most destructive in the state's history. "You look at other countries where they do it differently, and it’s a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland, and he said we have a much different -- ‘we’re a forest nation.’ He called it a ‘forest nation.’ And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don’t have any problem.” Finnish President Sauli Niinisto later told a Finnish newspaper he had briefly discussed forest management with Trump while the two were in Paris for Armistice Day, but he did not recall mentioning "raking the forest," according to the Associated Press.   While Finland's leader was bemused, Finns themselves were amused, especially with the hashtag "#haravointi," Finnish for "raking." According to the analytics firm Spredfast, Finland had the second-highest concentration of #haravointi tweets after the United States. "Here I am just #raking around as all us #finns do to prevent forest fires," one person tweeted, along with a gif of a raking team:  Here I am just #raking around as all us #finns do to prevent forest fires. pic.twitter.com/lNFUiQoqmj   #haravointi #raking in the forrest in Finland ;) #Trump pic.twitter.com/h4fSY77i8v   Just waiting for this leaf to drop so I can rake it!

Trump initially drew criticism for a tweet appearing to blame California's forest management for the blazes and even threatening to withdraw federal funds if the state did not make unspecified changes. "There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor," the president tweeted after the fires began. "Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!"

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/a-divided-congress-still-has-time-for-redemption---split---Neil Gorsuch's confirmation stands out as a big achievement for the GOP Congress. (CQ Roll Call File Photo) The demise of the Republican effort to repeal the 2010 health care law put an exclamation point on what has become obvious in Washington: The GOP, for all its enthusiasm following its election win last year, is too riven with dissension to meet ambitious goals it set out for itself. And President Donald Trump seems to have oversold his skills as a deal-maker. “On delivering on their campaign promises, it’s hard to pat them on the back and tell them they’ve done a good job,” said Sam Geduldig, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, now a partner at the CGCN Group lobbying firm. That said, the downfall of the Senate health care effort has obscured the achievements Congress has had. History shows that “it is a mistake to expect big-ticket legislative accomplishments during the early months of presidents newly elected to the office,” said David Mayhew, the Yale political scientist who is perhaps America’s foremost student of congressional productivity. The exceptions come in moments of crisis, such as early 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed landmark legislation to regulate the sale of stock in response to the Great Depression, or early 2009, when President Barack Obama got his stimulus bill to revive an ailing economy. Obama didn’t sign his health care law or his financial regulatory overhaul, Dodd-Frank, until his second year in office. President George W. Bush got a tax cut across the finish line in June of his first year but didn’t sign the biggest policy victory of his first Congress, the No Child Left Behind law, until January of the following year. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have set ambitious goals to overhaul the 2010 health care law and revamp the tax code. Prospects for both look bleak — GOP leaders announced last week they were throwing out their initial tax plan — but who knows? It’s easy to foresee the 115th Congress setting a record for futility. But there have been achievements. So far, the biggest GOP win was the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, gained by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority to confirm him — as well as hold the seat open more than year after Antonin Scalia’s death, depriving Obama of the chance at so much as a hearing for his nominee to succeed Scalia, Merrick G. Garland. The Senate has confirmed every Trump Cabinet appointee it considered. Trump’s only loss on that front, his first Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder, dropped out after acknowledging that he’d hired an unauthorized immigrant as a housekeeper. Trump trails his three most recent predecessors, Obama, Bush and Bill Clinton, in the pace of his nominations and confirmations. On the productive side of the ledger, this Congress did make innovative use of the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law allowing it to rescind recently finalized regulations. It had been used successfully once before, in 2001, when Bush signed a resolution revoking a rule by the Clinton Labor Department requiring employers to protect their workers from repetitive stress injuries: the ergonomics rule. This year, Congress rescinded 14 Obama-era regulations to keep pollution out of streams and guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, among other things. Such CRA resolutions make up nearly a third of its legislative output. It also sets a precedent future Congresses will surely mimic. In May, Congress finalized fiscal 2017 spending. It came seven months after the fiscal year began, but was done without shutdown brinkmanship. In June, Trump signed a law that marks a bipartisan win: a measure responding to the scandal at Veterans Affairs Department hospitals, where dying veterans were left waiting for appointments. The law makes it easier to fire VA employees for poor performance and for whistleblowers to come forward. Still, Congress hasn’t made much progress on basic obligations. Fiscal 2018 appropriations bills have only begun to move, with no indication Republican leaders can, as promised, restore an orderly budget process. The House passed a “minibus” spending bill Thursday covering four of the 12 annual appropriations bills for defense, military construction and veterans’ benefits, energy, and the legislative branch. It included $1.57 billion for barriers along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. There’s little likelihood it will be enacted in its current form. Because Democrats can block appropriations bills in the Senate, given the 60-vote threshold there, the two parties need to reach a deal to raise limits on defense and nondefense spending enacted in 2011. Democrats don’t plan to go along with the wall funding, or the defense spending increase in the House bill if there are not comparable nondefense increases. Congress must raise the debt limit, too, this fall — always a fraught vote. House Republicans hope to move a fiscal 2018 budget resolution when they return in September that would allow them to move forward with a tax overhaul using the fast-track budget reconciliation procedure. Reconciliation allows the Senate to pass measures that have budgetary effects such as taxes, spending and the deficit with only a simple majority. But disagreements among Republicans over the centerpiece of the House GOP leaders’ initial tax proposal, a border adjustment tax that would have hit imports, prompted leadership on Thursday to ask the tax-writing committees to start over. Meanwhile, Congress is making progress on other must-pass bills. The House has passed measures reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration’s system of user fees — which help fund the agency — and a defense authorization bill. They await Senate action. Both chambers are moving forward with legislation, due by Sept. 30, to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. Progress is slow because of Trump’s plan to privatize the air traffic control system. The House has incorporated the proposal into its bill, but the Senate has rejected it. Republicans are divided over the idea, with rural members most likely to oppose it for fear it could hurt small airports. And work has begun on reauthorization of the federal flood insurance program, also set to expire this year. Another issue is what to do about surveillance authority granted to the National Security Agency in 2008 to collect emails of foreign terrorist suspects. The NSA’s dragnet at one time captured messages written by Americans who were not suspects but merely mentioned people who were, prompting an outcry from civil libertarians. The agency earlier this year said it was now only collecting emails to or from suspects. Even so, the expiration of the authority at the end of this year will prompt a fight between security hawks who want to renew it, and civil liberties advocates who want to let it expire, or curtail it. Congress has made no progress on a resolution. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-blasts-little-adam-schitt-questions-whitaker-appointment---split---Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will assume the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee in the new Congress, and will relaunch its Russia investigation. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump bestowed a juvenile nickname on Rep. Adam Schiff on Sunday, but the congressman responded with a barb of his own. The president and the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman taunted each other on Twitter, a preview of the coming months, since the rivalry is sure to intensify when Schiff resurrects the committee’s Russia investigation after Democrats assume control of the House of Representatives in January. Trump lashed out at Schiff in a tweet, dubbing him “little Adam Schitt (D-CA).” He also diverted criticism of his appointment of acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker by questioning the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!  “Wow, Mr. President. That’s a good one,” Schiff responded. “Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller’s questions, or did you write this one yourself?” Trump instigated the spat minutes after Schiff called the appointment of Whitaker “unconstitutional” in a television appearance Sunday morning. “He was chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation,” Schiff said on ABC. “He auditioned for the part by going on TV and saying he could hobble the investigation and ethically, he should have nothing to do with the investigation.” The elevation of Whitaker — a Trump loyalist who has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe — has angered Democrats. Watch: Trump Says He Doesn’t Know Matt Whitaker The appointment also touched off a legal dispute about the propriety of the White House sidestepping the “advise and consent” role conferred to Senate by the Constitution. The White House also overrode the Justice Department’s own statutes about the rules of succession in tapping Whitaker. In the same television appearance, Schiff issued a warning to Whitaker that if he should interfere with the Mueller investigation, the Intelligence Committee is “going to find out about it. We’re going to expose it.” Trump told reporters on Friday that he had finished answering Mueller’s questions — by himself — about possible ties between his presidential campaign and Russia, which Schiff referenced in his tweet. “I’ve answered them very easily,” Trump said.

Clinton, Vanderbilt University Claire Durand, University of Montreal Charles Franklin, Marquette University Kyley McGeeney, Pew Research Center[1] Lee Miringoff, Marist College Kristen Olson, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Doug Rivers, Stanford University, YouGov Lydia Saad, Gallup Evans Witt, Princeton Survey Research Associates Chris Wlezien, University of Texas at Austin The Committee was supported by the following researchers: Junjie Chen, Andrew Engelhardt, Arnold Lau, Marc Trussler, Luis Patricio Pena Ibarra EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION PERFORMANCE OF POLLS IN 2016 RELATIVE TO PRIOR ELECTIONS EVIDENCE FOR THEORIES ABOUT WHY POLLS UNDER-ESTIMATED TRUMP'S SUPPORT POLLING AND PROBABILISTIC FORECASTING CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES APPENDIX EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The 2016 presidential election was a jarring event for polling in the United States. Pre-election polls fueled high-profile predictions that Hillary Clinton’s likelihood of winning the presidency was about 90 percent, with estimates ranging from 71 to over 99 percent. When Donald Trump was declared the winner of the presidency in the early hours of November 9th, it came as a shock even to his own pollsters (Jacobs and House 2016). There was (and continues to be) widespread consensus that the polls failed. But did the polls fail? And if so why? Those are the central questions addressed in this report, which was commissioned by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). This report is the product of a committee convened in the Spring of 2016 with a threefold goal: evaluate the accuracy of 2016 pre-election polling for both the primaries and the general election, review variation by different survey methodologies, and identify significant differences between election surveys in 2016 and polling in prior election years. The committee is comprised of scholars of public opinion and survey methodology as well as election polling practitioners. Our main findings are as follows: National polls were generally correct and accurate by historical standards. National polls were among the most accurate in estimating the popular vote since 1936. Collectively, they indicated that Clinton had about a 3 percentage point lead, and they were basically correct; she ultimately won the popular vote by 2 percentage points. Furthermore, the strong performance of national polls did not, as some have suggested, result from two large errors canceling (under-estimation of Trump support in heavily working class white states and over-estimation of his support in liberal-leaning states with sizable Hispanic populations). State-level polls showed a competitive, uncertain contest… In the contest that actually mattered, the Electoral College, state-level polls showed a competitive race in which Clinton appeared to have a slim advantage. Eight states with more than a third of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency had polls showing a lead of three points or less (Trende 2016).[2] As Sean Trende noted, “The final RealClearPolitics Poll Averages in the battleground states had Clinton leading by the slimmest of margins in the Electoral College, 272-266.” The polls on average indicated that Trump was one state away from winning the election. …but clearly under-estimated Trump’s support in the Upper Midwest. Polls showed Hillary Clinton leading, if narrowly, in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which had voted Democratic for president six elections running. Those leads fed predictions that the Democratic Blue Wall would hold. Come Election Day, however, Trump edged out victories in all three.

We've received your submission. News By Oli Coleman  November 14, 2018 | 8:59pm | Updated November 14, 2018 | 9:06pm President Trump’s campaign team is hard at work on a new crop of nicknames with which to torment his 2020 rivals, we’re told. While 2016’s “Lyin’ Ted,” “Lil Marco” and “Crooked Hillary” — the names he bestowed on rival presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton — appeared to be off-the-cuff feats of casual bullying, we’re told campaign operatives are busily workshopping punchy names for potential front-runners for the next White House race. And insiders said that they’re already preparing to take on Joe Biden, who said he’ll decide by January whether he’ll run. We’re told the current favorite for the former veep is “Creepy Joe” — a reference to Biden’s supposed habit of touching and kissing strangers and staffers alike. We’re told Team Trump settled on that title a couple of months ago — and, sure enough, Trump tried out the name at a Nevada rally in October. He told the crowd that he called Biden “1 Percent,” referring to what Trump claimed was Biden’s lack of support in previous presidential bids. “He never had more than 1 percent. So we call him either Sleepy Joe Biden or 1 Percent,” he said. He asked the crowd, “Which is better?” The president then suggested that an audience member had shouted out “Creepy Joe” as a possibility. It’s been a popular go-to for online critics of Biden. In September, Donald Trump Jr. used the same moniker while retweeting dubious Infowars provocateur Paul Joseph Watson. “We are all used to Creepy Joe saying stupid stuff but this is too far even for him,” wrote Don Jr., linking to a story that alleged Biden had called Trump supporters “dregs of society.” A Trump rep didn’t get back to us.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-signals-intent-nix-proposed-federal-pay-increase---split---President Donald Trump wants to rescind a scheduled pay increase for federal workers, saying he has the authority by citing a national emergency. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump signaled his intent to rescind a scheduled pay increase for federal workers, informing Congress on Thursday that federal law allowed him to do so in the event of a “national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare.” The move drew a quick response from D.C.-area members and is almost certain to draw howls from the Senate, which included a 1.9 percent pay raise in its Financial Services spending bill. That measure was part of a four-bill, $154 billion package that passed the Senate 92-6 earlier this month. The Senate Appropriations Committee emphatically beat back an amendment to strike the pay raise during a markup in June, rejecting the proposal in a 2-29 vote and keeping the raise. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat representing many federal workers living in the D.C. area, quickly criticized the move. “Zero. This seems to be how much respect President Trump has for federal workers,” he said in a statement. “It is outrageous and hypocritical that after spending billions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations … that suddenly the White House finds that there is zero money left to pay a minimal cost-of living adjustment,” he added. The pay freeze was also criticized by Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, who said Trump was “feeling cornered and lashing out by cancelling a modest, planned pay increase for our dedicated federal workforce.” “His tax bill exploded the deficit, and now he is trying to balance the budget on the backs of federal workers,” the Virginia Democrat said. Trump explained the move in terms of the national debt, now more than $21 trillion, and the annual deficit, expected to be $804 billion in fiscal 2018. Besides an across-the-board pay increase of 2.1 percent scheduled to go into effect in January 2019, Trump noted that locality pay increases taking place in high cost-of-living areas would amount to $25 billion. “We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,” he wrote in his letter to Congress. “Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to exercise my authority to set alternative across-the-board and locality pay adjustments for 2019. … Specifically, I have determined that for 2019, both across‑the‑board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero.” The president also pointed to the need to make federal pay “performance-based, and aligned strategically toward recruiting, retaining, and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets. Across-the-board pay increases and locality pay increases, in particular, have long-term fixed costs, yet fail to address existing pay disparities or target mission critical recruitment and retention goals.” A similar pay increase is not in the House Financial Services Appropriations bill. Democrats fumed over that bill not including a long-standing pay freeze for the vice president and top administration officials. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, the ranking Democrat on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, complained that the bill would remove the pay freeze for “one of the wealthiest Cabinets we’ve ever seen.” Meanwhile, the largest union representing government workers is rejecting the move to eliminate the pay increase for fiscal 2019 and calling for Congress to follow the Senate’s lead. “President Trump’s plan to freeze wages for these patriotic workers next year ignores the fact that they are worse off today financially than they were at the start of the decade,” American Federation of Government Employees National President J. David Cox Sr. said in a statement. He said the 1.9 percent pay increase would “help prevent workers from falling further behind next year and help federal agencies recruit and retain the high-caliber workforce that the public expects and deserves.” “Federal employees deserve the full measure of pay comparability provided by the law, and a 1.9 percent increase is the minimum that Congress should consider,” he said.

---split---7.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/grassley-gave-mcconnell-judges-now-wants-criminal-justice-bill---split---Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has helped confirm a record number of judges. All he wants from Mitch McConnell now is a little “reciprocity.” (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley is leaning on his track record of processing judicial nominations to get a floor vote on a bipartisan bill he spearheaded to overhaul the nation’s criminal justice system. In an unusual personal plea, the 85-year-old Iowa Republican on Thursday said he wanted “reciprocity” from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for “what I’ve done in our unified effort on judges” during President Donald Trump’s administration. Grassley has brushed aside or relaxed long-standing committee customs to get nominees to the floor quickly for final confirmation votes during Trump’s first two years in the White House, and McConnell made those a priority for floor time. The dozen Trump appointments to the influential appeals courts — which have the final say in the vast majority of cases — was a record number for a president’s first year in office. Republicans now have confirmed 29 appeals court judges plus Supreme Court Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh during the Trump administration. “I look at this in a very personal way,” Grassley told reporters. “Sen. McConnell and I have had a very close working relationship on judges. We’ve been very, very successful. And part of that success is because I’ve been able to get these nominees out of committee. We’ve made history, and we’ve got two good people on the Supreme Court.” Grassley also said the new compromise bill is a chance for the first sentencing reform in a generation, is bipartisan, and got Trump’s backing Wednesday. “And it seems to me the Senate majority leader ought to be helping the president get his program through,” Grassley said. But McConnell, who had at one point promised to do a whip count and bring the legislation to the floor if it had more than 60 votes, has said his caucus is split on the issue. He cast doubt Wednesday on whether he would allow a floor vote during the short lame-duck period, and spoke of other priorities. And Majority Whip John Cornyn did the same Thursday, noting that he one senator can withhold consent for a floor vote and force a time-consuming process. “I do think there are people in good faith who have some differences of opinion and they deserve to be heard as well,” Cornyn said during a committee hearing. Sen. John Kennedy, a Judiciary Committee member who is critical of criminal justice changes in his home state of Louisiana, said that he would object to unanimous consent if the new federal bill went to the floor because there’s not enough time to do it right. “I don’t think we’ll have the amount of time to get to it this year, not to do it properly, I just don’t,” Kennedy said. “We need to have a hearing. We need to know what we’re voting on. This is a very important issue and Americans are looking to us to get it right.” Earlier Thursday, Sen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who has been an outspoken opponent of the criminal justice overhaul, tweeted his concerns to Grassley in a way that made it appear he wouldn’t be agreeing to unanimous consent to move to the bill. Grassley had also made a plea to other Republicans on the social media platform, writing Wednesday that, “I sincerely hope no GOP Sen is trying to undermine Pres Trump & son in law/adviser Kushner w false info on this TOUGH ON CRIME & SMART bill.” Cotton replied: “agree, false info not helpful. Please release bill text to allow for full public discussion.” Cotton also tweeted that a Judiciary Committee hearing “would be helpful too.” A few hours after Cotton’s tweet, the text of the bill was released. It combines prison measures to help federal prisoners better rejoin society with four sentencing provisions that would give judges more discretion as well as lower terms for crack cocaine, firearms and minor drug offenders, according to a summary distributed by the authors. “This bill represents the culmination of a lot of hard work by lawmakers and advocates from across the political spectrum,” Grassley said. “President Trump has shown real leadership to advance these important reforms — the most significant in a generation. We have a real opportunity to make these important reforms a reality before the end of the year.” Sen. Richard J. Durbin called it “the best chance in a generation to make meaningful changes in our federal drug sentencing laws.” Joining the bill were Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Cosponsors are Republican Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democratic Sens. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Chris Coons of Delaware.

---split---7.0---split---https://www.rollcall.com/news/gonzales/its-not-too-early-to-start-looking-at-the-2020-senate-map---split---Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., is up for re-election in 2020 in a state carried by both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) The votes haven’t all been counted in the 2018 Senate elections, but we know the size of the incoming majority will be critical, because the 2020 Senate map offers limited initial takeover opportunities for both parties. Of course, it’s too early to tell what the presidential race will look like, how voters will feel about the economy and direction of the country, and whether they’ll believe more Democrats are needed in Washington.  The next class of senators was last elected in 2014 — a great midterm year for Republicans in which they gained nine seats. But the consequence of having a good year in the Senate is having to defend those seats six years later. Republicans will be playing more defense next cycle, defending at least 21 Senate seats while Democrats will be defending 12 — the opposite dynamic from this cycle. The shape of the presidential race matters, considering 2016 was the first time in the history of popularly elected senators that the Senate outcomes matched the presidential outcomes in every state. If you apply the 2016 presidential results to the 2020 Senate class, the result is no net change. Using the 2012 presidential results as a guide, Democrats would gain two Senate seats by losing Alabama and picking up Colorado, Maine, and Iowa. If the 2008 presidential results applied, Democrats would gain three seats by losing Alabama and taking over Colorado, Iowa, Maine, and North Carolina. Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly), Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 Usually the races are more complex and the size of the Senate playing field will also depend on retirements, recruitment and primaries, beyond the presidential map. What immediately stands out about the 2020 Senate landscape is the initial lack of vulnerable Democratic senators. Doug Jones of Alabama is the only Democratic senator representing a state that Donald Trump and Mitt Romney carried in the last two presidential elections. Jones was elected in a December 2017 special election with 50 percent over Roy Moore, who had significant baggage from his past. Jones will start as an underdog in his re-election race. Gary Peters of Michigan is the only other Democratic senator from a state that Trump won in 2016 (albeit with 47.5 percent). But Obama carried Michigan with 54 percent and we saw in 2018 that most of the Democratic senators from states Trump carried narrowly were at limited risk. (And a Democrat won the governorship in Michigan on Tuesday night.) At least two Democratic senators who are up for re-election are eyeing presidential bids: Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. If they chose to give up their seats to focus on the White House, competitive primaries would likely ensue, but Democrats would start as favorites to hold both states. Most of the action on the Democratic side could be in primaries to take on GOP senators. Senate Democrats largely avoided them this cycle because they had savvy incumbents seeking re-election in challenging states. But open opportunities to take on Republicans will be a different story. The crowded and competitive House primaries in 2018 are likely a precursor to what will happen in the Senate next cycle. And those races will likely play host to fights over ideology and the power of the establishment, with potential general election consequences. Democrats could also see a challenge to one of their incumbents. According to a September story in The New York Times, Rep. Seth Moulton is considering a primary challenge to Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The race wouldn’t have general election consequences but would be another sign of anti-establishment fervor within the Democratic Party. Every cycle, there is a least one retirement and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois might be one of them. Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos is close to the senator and would be an obvious successor if a spot in House leadership or a spot as a running mate on a presidential ticket doesn’t conflict. Based on the 2016 presidential results, Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine would be the most vulnerable senators, as the only two Republicans in states that Clinton carried in 2016. There won’t be any shortage of Democrats looking to take on Gardner, particularly after his vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his cycle as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And Democratic donors around the country rallied to raise more than $4 million for a Collins challenger in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings. Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina represent Trump states that Obama carried previously and should be regarded as initially vulnerable as well. Trump and Romney carried Arizona, but uncertainty surrounding the late John McCain’s seat could make it interesting. The seat will be on the ballot in November 2020. Republican retirements are also a possibility. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is 82 years old and faced a competitive primary in 2014, which he won 48 percent to 41 percent. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma is 83 years old, but doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. Competitive primaries are likely if either or both seats open up. Some GOP incumbents could face primary challengers. For Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, that could be Mark Green, who hasn’t even been sworn in yet as the congressman from the 7th District. Alexander won his 2014 primary by 9 points and with just less than 50 percent against six candidates. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has been a vocal Trump critic, which should draw him a primary challenger, even though there isn’t an initial obvious choice. With Nebraska likely to lose a congressional seat before the 2022 elections, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry might attempt a jump to the Senate in 2020 instead of facing off against fellow Reps. Don Bacon or Adrian Smith in a primary down the road. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina looked likely to draw a primary challenge after being critical of Trump during the 2016 campaign. But he’s since done a 180 and was given credit for turning around Kavanaugh’s confirmation. One of the most fascinating races in the country next cycle could be in Kentucky. Sen. Mitch McConnell has proved his skills as majority leader and as a campaigner, but his unfavorable rating has climbed over the years and he seems likely to face another competitive race. While the presidential race will suck up most of the oxygen in the 2020 room, the fight for the Senate should once again be a prime battle. Correction, Thursday, 4:35 p.m. | An earlier version of the 2020 Senate map should have identified Arizona as a state that will host a Senate election that year.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) ANALYSIS | Most of Donald Trump’s predecessors endorsed the notion of the buck stopping “here,” meaning on their desks. But for the 45th president, the buck often stops elsewhere. Trump sat down with Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace for a 15-minute interview that aired Sunday. Even though the sit-down in the White House’s Roosevelt Room was relatively brief, the president showed several times how just about everything political is fungible — especially when the stakes are high for himself. For instance, the president teased a handful of additional Cabinet and staff changes during the interview. Then he said he might just switch out two more officials. From his staff to whether he will sit down with Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III to the outcome of the midterm elections, Trump often makes declarative statements, while leaving just enough wiggle room to make one of his frequent changes of mind. The midterms look worse for Trump and Republicans than they did the day after Election Day, when he painted House losses as a historically lighter blow than his modern predecessors suffered while touting the GOP’s Senate gains. During a rowdy press conference on Nov. 7, he declared the election “close to a complete victory.” Fast forward to nearly two weeks later and Democrats are poised to pick up around 40 House seats. Wallace pressed Trump on this point, but the president refused anew to repeat some version of George W. Bush’s 2006 admission of suffering a “thumping” or Barack Obama’s 2010 “shellacking” assessment. “Excuse me, I won the Senate,” he interjected sharply. The buck, in short, stops elsewhere when it comes to House GOP losses. “I’m not on the ballot, but in a certain way I’m on the ballot, so please go out and vote,” Trump urged a crowd of supporters in Southaven, Mississippi, on Oct. 2. Fast forward 46 days: “But I have people and you see the polls, how good they are, I have people that won’t vote unless I’m on the ballot, OK? And I wasn’t on the ballot,” he said before saying he personally tipped Senate and gubernatorial races in Florida and Georgia that have officially been secured by the GOP candidates. The president’s attempts to build some wiggle room into what happened on Election Day boils down to a claim that he cannot control what his supporters do. “I didn’t run. I wasn’t running. My name wasn’t on the ballot,” he said. “‘Sir, we’ll never vote unless you’re on the ballot.’ I get it all the time. … As much as I try and convince people to go vote, I’m not on the ballot.” Shorter Trump: Don’t blame me — I did my part. As he did in the Fox interview, the president has vacillated for months about whether or not he will sit for an interview with Mueller. At one point Sunday, he appeared to rule it out. “I think we’ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we’re finished,” the president said of his intention to submit to the special counsel written answers he claims to have penned himself but have been worked on extensively by his legal team. But there’s that penchant for wiggle room again. “We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn’t have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem,” he said. “If it doesn’t, you know, I’ll be told and we’ll make a decision at that time.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-campaign-tests-nickname-game-2020---split---Expect a batch of new nicknames for President Donald Trump's political opponents as the 2020 campaign heats up. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump’s campaign team is experimenting in its laboratory with potential nicknames for his potential opponents in the 2020 presidential election. The president’s trademark campaign tactic from 2016 — the birth year of “Crooked” Hillary Clinton, “Little” Marco Rubio, and “Lyin’” Ted Cruz — became so ubiquitous in his speeches and campaign literature that it spawned an exhaustive Wikipedia list of everyone whose name Trump has manipulated for political gain. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden will decide whether to run by January, he has said. That has not stopped the Trump re-election campaign from experimenting with derogatory nicknames for him, the New York Post reported. The Trump team is leaning toward “Creepy Joe,” the Post reported, a reference to the vice president’s penchant for putting his hands on and leaning close to aides, congressional family members, and others when he talks to them. Trump took the term out for a test run at a rally in Nevada in October, and his son, Donald Trump Jr., has posted it on social media. Trump’s campaign isn’t the only political operation to deploy schoolyard nicknames in a contested race. The National Republican Senatorial Committee leaned into the nickname gambit this cycle — with a degree of success — in key races like North Dakota and Indiana. Early in the cycle, the group dubbed Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana “Mexico Joe,” contending that the first-term senator, who lost to former state lawmaker and businessman Mike Braun in last week’s midterm elections, had facilitated the outsourcing of thousands of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. And North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who lost last week to GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer in her re-election bid, was derided as “High Five Heidi” for a celebration she shared with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on the Senate floor after they helped strike down a bill limiting abortions to certain portions of pregnancy.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-casts-pelosis-speaker-savior---split---House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says she has ample support among Democrats to become the next speaker. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) President Donald Trump on Saturday said he can twist enough House Republican arms to give Nancy Pelosi the necessary votes to become speaker. The California Democrat publicly says she has ample support within her own caucus to secure the gavel. But all indications are a floor vote could be close, meaning Republicans could opt — for a list of reasons — to put her over the top. For Trump, making Pelosi speaker would give him the sense that she owes him legislatively and also ensure that his top campaign-trail foil, who remains intensely unpopular with Republican voters, remains in the headlines through his re-election bid. [Awkward Moments from Donald Trump's Veterans Day Do-Over] “I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House,” he tweeted Saturday morning ahead of a trip to California to visit with people affected by wildfires. He again wrote that Pelosi “deserves this victory, she has earned it — but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away.” Ultimately, Trump predicted Pelosi “will win!” I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win! @TomReedCongress  He reiterated his promise to assist Pelosi as he left the White House for California, saying he could get her however many GOP votes she needs, whether it was 100 or 10. Pelosi said Thursday she intends to win the speakership with Democratic votes and would not accept help from Republicans. “Oh please, no,” she said. “Never. Never. Never.” Trump told reporters Saturday that his legal team would submit written answers to questions posed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “They’re all done,” he said of his responses, which he claimed Friday to have written himself. He also said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief him on Air Force One about the agency’s findings about whether Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump again said he has been told the crown prince was not involved in the assassination, despite reports the CIA has concluded the de facto Saudi ruler gave the green-light to lure Khashoggi to Turkey and then kill him. Asked about a New York Times report that he is concerned over Vice President Mike Pence’s loyalty, Trump replied: “No, I don’t question his loyalty at all. … It was a phony story. I doubt they had any sources. … He’s been a trooper.” “Mike Pence is 100 percent,” the president said several times. Trump said he is not close to picking a nominee for attorney general, but is close to announcing a UN ambassador pick.

---split---8.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/political-drama-converges-supreme-court-ceremony---split---President Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh at a courtesy visit in the Justices’ Conference Room prior to the investiture ceremony. (Fred Schilling, Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States) A Supreme Court sitting Thursday for the ceremonial investiture of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh took only 10 minutes, but it concentrated Washington's political and legal drama in one room. Matthew Whitaker made his first public appearance as acting attorney general, reading a presidential commission from the courtroom podium less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump forced the resignation of Jeff Sessions as the nation’s top law enforcement officer. But Kavanaugh has been hearing cases for weeks, and the official commission couldn’t be changed. When the Supreme Court clerk read the commission out loud, he announced it was signed by Trump and Sessions. Kavanaugh is Trump’s second appointment to the Supreme Court, but he has said it won’t be his last. And it was who wasn’t at the ceremony — Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — that added to the intrigue. Ginsburg, the oldest justice at age 85, was recovering Thursday morning at George Washington University Hospital from a fall at the court Wednesday night that fractured three ribs on her left side, the court announced. She felt discomfort overnight and was admitted for observation and treatment. Trump and first lady Melania Trump were there for the occasion. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., rumored to be among those who could be nominated as the next attorney general, arrived at the court with Trump and left with him as well. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein attended, as speculation swirls that he could be the next Justice Department official to leave the agency. Until Wednesday’s appointment of Whitaker, he had overseen the probe into connections between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came to watch and spent some time chatting with former independent counsel Ken Starr, who led the investigation in the 1990s into Bill Clinton that led to impeachment. Kavanaugh was one of Starr’s investigators during that time. Also in the gallery was retiring House Judiciary Chairman Robert W. Goodlatte, R-Va., and retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. For his part, Kavanaugh sat in a bench chair used by Chief Justice John Marshall from 1819 to 1835 and then walked up to the bench to take an oath — his fourth since being confirmed in October. “We wish you a long and happy career in our common calling,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. told Kavanaugh. DNC Chairman: Sessions Firing ‘In Some Ways Worse Than Saturday Day Night Massacre’ Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. CNN wins court order against the Trump administration after the White House revoked the CNN reporter's credentials. The White House will not seek to again revoke CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s hard pass, as first reported on Monday by Fox News' John Roberts. “Today the White House fully restored Jim Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,” CNN said in a statement. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also implemented a series of rules that will govern White House press conferences going forward. According to Sanders, the new rules are: “We are mindful that a more elaborate and comprehensive set of rules might need to be devised," Sanders said. CNN's Jim Acosta questions U.S. President Donald Trump during his news conference following Tuesday's midterm U.S. congressional elections at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 7, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RC189F0AFAA0 Acosta was spotted at the White House moments after CNN issued its statement. It was widely believed earlier Monday that the White House would again attempt to ban Acosta from the White House after legal threats were exchanged in a series of emails and court filings. Acosta’s "hard pass," which provides expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended earlier this month after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. Acosta then refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide and there was brief contact between the two. His hard pass was revoked later that day and CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta’s First and Fifth Amendment rights. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly temporarily restored Acosta’s credential. Later in the day, the White House sent the CNN reporter a letter informing him that a “preliminary decision” was made that his credential would be revoked, once again, after the temporary 14-day order expires. The attorney for CNN and Acosta claimed in a Monday court filing that the White House was attempting to punish Acosta based on “retroactive” application of rules that aren’t written and requested a hearing for the week of Nov. 26. The request for an emergency hearing is now a moot point, as the White House will not seek to keep Acosta from covering President Trump. “The White House’s interaction with the press is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take. President Trump believes strongly in the First Amendment, and a free press and is the most accessible President in modern history. It would be a great loss for all if, instead of relying on the professionalism of White House journalists, we were compelled to devise a lengthy and detailed code of conduct for White House events,” Sanders said to conclude her statement. Last week, Fox News announced that it would support CNN’s effort to restore Acosta’s White House credential and filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. CNN's Jim Acosta questions U.S. President Donald Trump during his news conference following Tuesday's midterm U.S. congressional elections at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 7, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RC189F0AFAA0 Following the temporary decision, Trump told Fox News’ Chris Wallace that he will kick Acosta out of press conferences if he "misbehaves" going forward. Acosta has emerged as a hero of the #Resistance after making a habit of shouting and interrupting when Trump and members of his administration are available to the media. The CNN reporter has also gotten into combative arguments with other members of the administration, including former Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. “Thanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday... let's get back to work,” Acosta tweeted. Fox News’ John Roberts contributed to this report.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/opinion/economy-trump-red-blue-states.html---split---Supported by Why we went from regional divide to political chasm. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist A little over a year ago, Amazon invited cities and states to offer bids for a proposed second headquarters. This set off a mad scramble over who would gain the dubious privilege of paying large subsidies in return for worsened traffic congestion and higher housing prices. (Answer: New York and greater D.C.) But not everyone was in the running. From the beginning, Amazon specified that it would put the new facility only in a Democratic congressional district. O.K., that’s not literally what Amazon said. It only limited the competition to “metropolitan areas with more than one million people” and “urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent.” But in the next Congress the great majority of locations meeting those criteria will, in fact, be represented by Democrats. Over the past generation, America’s regions have experienced a profound economic divergence. Rich metropolitan areas have gotten even richer, attracting ever more of the nation’s fastest growing industries. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas have been bypassed, forming a sort of economic rump left behind by the knowledge economy. Amazon’s headquarters criteria perfectly illustrate the forces behind that divergence. Businesses in the new economy want access to large pools of highly educated workers, which can be found only in big, rich metropolitan areas. And the location decisions of companies like Amazon draw even more high-skill workers to those areas. In other words, there’s a cumulative, self-reinforcing process at work that is, in effect, dividing America into two economies. And this economic division is reflected in political division. In 2016, of course, the parts of America that are being left behind voted heavily for Donald Trump. News organizations responded with many, many, many profiles of rural Trump supporters sitting in diners. But this was, it turns out, fighting the last war. Trumpism turned America’s lagging regions solid red, but the backlash against Trumpism has turned its growing regions solid blue. Some of the reporters interviewing guys in diners should have been talking to college-educated women in places like California’s Orange County, a former ultraconservative stronghold that, come January, will be represented in Congress entirely by Democrats. Why have lagging regions turned right while successful regions turned left? It doesn’t seem to be about economic self-interest. True, Trump promised to bring back traditional jobs in manufacturing and coal mining — but that promise was never credible. And the orthodox Republican policy agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking social programs, which is basically what Trump is following in practice, actually hurts lagging regions, which depend a lot on things like food stamps and disability payments, much more than it hurts successful areas. Furthermore, there is little if any support in voting data for the notion that “economic anxiety” drove people to vote for Trump. As documented in “Identity Politics,” an important new book analyzing the 2016 election, what distinguished Trump voters wasn’t financial hardship but “attitudes related to race and ethnicity.” Yet these attitudes aren’t divorced from economic change. Even if they’re personally doing well, many voters in lagging regions have a sense of grievance, a feeling that they’re being disrespected by the glittering elites of superstar cities; this sense of grievance all too easily turns into racial antagonism. Conversely, however, the transformation of the G.O.P. into a white nationalist party alienates voters — even white voters — in those big, successful metropolitan areas. So the regional economic divide becomes a political chasm. Can this chasm be bridged? Honestly, I doubt it. We can and should do a lot to improve the lives of Americans in lagging regions. We can guarantee access to health care and raise their incomes with wage subsidies and other policies (in fact, the earned-income tax credit, which helps low-wage workers, already disproportionally benefits workers in low-income states). But restoring these regions’ dynamism is much harder, because it means swimming against a powerful economic tide. And the sense of being left behind can make people angry even if their material needs are taken care of. That is what we see, for example, in the former East Germany: Despite huge financial aid from the west and generous social programs, “Ossis” feel aggrieved by what they see as second-class status, and they have given many of their votes to extreme right-wing parties. So the bitter division we see in America — the ugliness infecting our politics — may have deep economic roots, and there may be no practical way to make it go away. But the ugliness doesn’t have to win. Most rural white voters still support Trumpism, but they aren’t a majority, and in the midterms a significant number of those voters also broke with the white nationalist agenda. America, then, is a divided nation, and is likely to stay that way for a while. But the better angels of our nature can still prevail.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.people-press.org/2018/07/18/taking-sides-on-facebook-how-congressional-outreach-changed-under-president-trump/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  U.S. Politics & Policy Democratic legislators’ opposition on Facebook spiked after Trump’s election, while angry reactions increased among all congressional Facebook followers The 2016 presidential election coincided with substantial shifts in the ways that members of Congress communicated with their constituents online. A new Pew Research Center analysis examines congressional Facebook posts from Jan. 1, 2015, through Dec. 31, 2017, a three-year timespan that includes the entire 114th session of Congress, the 2016 primary and general elections, the first year of the 115th Congress, and Republican President Donald Trump’s first year in office. The analysis finds that Democrats expressed political opposition nearly five times as much under Trump as they did during the last two years of Barack Obama’s presidency. Much of this opposition was directed at President Trump, though Democrats also increasingly opposed Republican members of Congress.  Political opposition and political support refer to statements made by members of Congress on Facebook that oppose or support the actions, decisions or positions of political actors and groups. This report examines support or opposition directed toward Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Democrats or liberals, and Republicans or conservatives. Researchers determined whether or not individual posts expressed opposition or support by classifying a set of posts manually and then training a machine learning model to classify the rest. Researchers classified whether posts expressed both opposition to some figures or groups and support for others, but did not classify both support and opposition directed at the same figures or groups. Local issues refer to references within congressional statements to any place, group, individual(s) or event in the politician’s state or district. Researchers determined whether or not individual posts discussed local issues by classifying a set of posts manually and then training a machine learning model to classify the rest. DW-NOMINATE is a measure of political ideology that places members of the U.S. House and Senate on a liberal-to-conservative ideology scale according to their roll-call voting history in each legislative session of Congress1 The scale ranges from -1 (very liberal) to 1 (very conservative) across all Congresses. For the time period studied here, it ranges between -0.77 and 0.99. Very liberal and very conservative legislators are defined as those with DW-NOMINATE scores in the furthest left 10% and furthest right 10% of all DW-NOMINATE scores. Moderates are defined as legislators with DW-NOMINATE scores in the middle 20% of all scores. Engagement on Facebook refers to “likes,” “comments” and “shares,” as well as specific reactions, such as “angry.” On the Facebook platform, these digital actions provide users a means for interacting with posts created by members of Congress.  Meanwhile, congressional Republicans posted in support of Trump more than twice as much as congressional Democrats posted in support of President Obama during his final two years in office (researchers did not have access to posts from Obama’s first year in office).2 Members of Congress who expressed political opposition most often were also the most liberal or conservative.3 This pattern is in line with the Center’s previous research on how members of Congress express political disagreement. But the new analysis also shows that the most ideological members were also the most likely to express support for others in their party. In other words, the most liberal and conservative members of Congress both attacked those on the other side more often and were more likely to affirm their own side’s decisions and positions. Moderates, meanwhile, tended to focus most of their posts on local issues. Changes occurred not only in what members posted, but also in how their online audiences responded. The Facebook audience increasingly expressed angry reactions when responding to congressional posts. In early 2016, Facebook introduced alternatives to the traditional “like” reaction – and between late February 2016 and Election Day, just 2% of all reactions to posts used the “angry” option. But by the end of 2017, 9% of all reactions to posts by Democrats and 13% of reactions to posts by Republicans were angry. Nearly universally, both supportive and oppositional posts about Trump or Obama drew more engagement – including likes, comments and shares – than posts about other topics. But the pattern was somewhat different for Hillary Clinton. Congressional posts that supported her drew the same number of likes as posts that did not take sides either way, while posts opposing her received 93% more likes on average – the largest increase in likes across all the kinds of posts examined here. The new analysis used a combination of human coders and machine learning techniques to examine both the changing nature of congressional Facebook outreach and the way Facebook audiences responded to varying kinds of messages. To create the dataset, researchers studied more than 700,000 posts from 599 members of Congress during a three-year period surrounding the November 2016 election and Trump’s first year in office, beginning Jan. 1, 2015, and ending Dec. 31, 2017. Among the key findings: This analysis is based on 737,598 Facebook posts issued by 599 members of Congress between Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2017. The total number of legislators is greater than 535 (the current number of voting officials in the U.S. House and Senate) because members who were newly elected in the 115th Congress or in special elections are included in the study, as long as they produced at least 10 posts within a given Congress. Researchers included both official Facebook accounts (those managed by congressional staff) and unofficial accounts (those used in a personal or campaign capacity) for members of Congress in this analysis. They did so in order to capture a more complete range of outreach on social media than would be possible with official accounts alone. As a result, the study includes a total of 1,129 accounts belonging to the 599 individual legislators. Official accounts are used to communicate information as part of the member’s representational or legislative capacity, and U.S. Senate and House members may draw upon official staff resources appropriated by Congress when releasing content via these accounts. Unofficial accounts – often used in a personal and campaign capacity – may not draw on these government resources under official House and Senate guidelines. Members posted more often on official accounts across the study period: 76% of the average member’s posts came from their official account (for Democrats, the share was 78%; for Republicans, it was 75%). To classify the posts, Pew Research Center manually analyzed a subset (11,000 total) of all the posts, classifying each post’s contents for the events, topics and issues raised or discussed in each one. Specifically, the analysts coded each post based on whether it expressed disagreement with presidents, candidates or parties; expressed support for the same; or mentioned local events, places or people. Next, researchers trained machine learning algorithms to make predictions – based on what the human coders reported – in order to classify the content of the entire set of posts.  Researchers asked human coders recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to read a sample of 11,000 posts and then note whether or not the post mentioned a list of political figures and groups. That list included Trump, Obama and Clinton, as well as two political groups: Democrats and/or liberals and Republicans and/or conservatives. The coders determined whether each post that mentioned one of those individuals or groups expressed support, opposition or neither toward each figure or group. Human coders also determined whether or not each post discussed local issues, defined as relating to “a place, a group, individual(s), or an event in the politician’s state or district.” Each set of particular kinds of post – those labeled as opposing Obama, or supporting Republicans, for instance – was used as a “training dataset” for separate machine learning models. Those models used the human decisions about what words convey political support or opposition as a guide for determining how to classify the remaining posts that human coders did not read and classify. This approach builds upon previous Pew Research Center work that examined similar kinds of rhetoric in congressional statements. Performance statistics and additional details are provided in the methodology. While Facebook is one important part of members’ media outreach efforts, members also communicate with their constituents through press releases, town hall meetings, media appearances and on other social media outlets. Although this report does not examine communication across all these channels, Facebook posts constitute a useful way to compare members’ communication, as they can be systematically captured and analyzed. Previous research suggests that statements that members of Congress express on Facebook are similar in many ways to those they make in press releases. Focusing on Facebook posts also makes it possible to measure how much a member’s audience interacts with their posts via likes, comments and shares. Facebook is the most widely used social media website (excluding YouTube) and the social media site from which most Americans get news.

---split---9.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/2017/01/10/how-america-changed-during-barack-obamas-presidency/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  January 10, 2017 By Michael Dimock Barack Obama campaigned for the U.S. presidency on a platform of change. As he prepares to leave office, the country he led for eight years is undeniably different. Profound social, demographic and technological changes have swept across the United States during Obama’s tenure, as have important shifts in government policy and public opinion. Apple released its first iPhone during Obama’s 2007 campaign, and he announced his vice presidential pick – Joe Biden – on a two-year-old platform called Twitter. Today, use of smartphones and social media has become the norm in U.S. society, not the exception. The election of the nation’s first black president raised hopes that race relations in the U.S. would improve, especially among black voters. But by 2016, following a spate of high-profile deaths of black Americans during encounters with police and protests by the Black Lives Matter movement and other groups, many Americans – especially blacks – described race relations as generally bad.

Trend data from CBS News and New York Times surveys. PEW RESEARCH CENTER The U.S. economy is in much better shape now than it was in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which cost millions of Americans their homes and jobs and led Obama to push through a roughly $800 billion stimulus package as one of his first orders of business. Unemployment has plummeted from 10% in late 2009 to below 5% today; the Dow Jones Industrial Average has more than doubled. But by some measures, the country faces serious economic challenges: A steady hollowing of the middle class, for example, continued during Obama’s presidency, and income inequality reached its highest point since 1928. Obama’s election quickly elevated America’s image abroad, especially in Europe, where George W. Bush was deeply unpopular following the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In 2009, shortly after Obama took office, residents in many countries expressed a sharp increase in confidence in the ability of the U.S. president to do the right thing in international affairs. While Obama remained largely popular internationally throughout his tenure, there were exceptions, including in Russia and key Muslim nations. And Americans themselves became more wary of international engagement. Views on some high-profile social issues shifted rapidly. Eight states and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana for recreational purposes, a legal shift accompanied by a striking reversal in public opinion: For the first time on record, a majority of Americans now support legalization of the drug. As it often does, the Supreme Court settled momentous legal battles during Obama’s tenure, and in 2015, it overturned long-standing bans on same-sex marriage, effectively legalizing such unions nationwide. Even before the court issued its landmark ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, a majority of Americans said for the first time that they favored same-sex marriage. As the Obama era draws to a close, Pew Research Center looks back on these and other important social, demographic and political shifts that have occurred at home and abroad during the tenure of the 44th president. And we look ahead to some of the trends that could define the tenure of the 45th, Donald Trump. Demographic changes don’t happen quickly. Obama’s presidency is only a chapter in a story that began long before his arrival and will continue long after his departure. Even so, the U.S. of today differs in some significant ways from the U.S. of 2008. Millennials are approaching Baby Boomers as the nation’s largest living adult generation and as the largest generation of eligible voters. The nation’s growing diversity has become more evident, too. In 2013, for the first time, the majority of newborn babies in the U.S. were racial or ethnic minorities. The same year, a record-high 12% of newlyweds married someone of a different race. The November electorate was the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Nearly one-in-three eligible voters on Election Day were Hispanic, black, Asian or another racial or ethnic minority, reflecting a steady rise since 2008. Strong growth in the number of Hispanic eligible voters, in particular U.S.-born youth, drove much of this change. Indeed, for the first time, the Hispanic share of the electorate is now on par with the black share. While illegal immigration served as a flashpoint in the tumultuous campaign to succeed Obama, there has been little change in the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. since 2009. And for the first time since the 1940s, more Mexican immigrants – both legal and unauthorized – have returned to Mexico from the U.S. than have entered. When it comes to the nation’s religious identity, the biggest trend during Obama’s presidency is the rise of those who claim no religion at all. Those who self-identify as atheists or agnostics, as well as those who say their religion is “nothing in particular,” now make up nearly a quarter of the U.S. adult population, up from 16% in 2007. Christians, meanwhile, have fallen from 78% to 71% of the U.S. adult population, owing mainly to modest declines in the share of adults who identify with mainline Protestantism and Catholicism. The share of Americans identifying with evangelical Protestantism, historically black Protestant denominations and other smaller Christian groups, by contrast, have remained fairly stable. Due largely to the growth of those who don’t identify with any religion, the shares of Americans who say they believe in God, consider religion to be very important in their lives, say they pray daily and say they attend religious services at least monthly have all ticked downward in recent years. At the same time, the large majority of Americans who do identify with a faith are, on average, as religiously observant as they were a few years ago, and by some measures even more so. The tide of demographic changes in the U.S. has affected both major parties, but in different ways. Democratic voters are becoming less white, less religious and better-educated at a faster rate than that of the country, while Republicans are aging more quickly than the country as a whole. Education, in particular, has emerged as an important dividing line in recent years, with college graduates becoming more likely to identify as Democrats and those without a college degree becoming more likely to identify as Republicans. More politically divided Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in November’s bitterly contested election, becoming the first person ever to win the White House with no prior political or military experience. But the divisions that emerged during the campaign and in its aftermath had been building long before Trump announced his candidacy, and despite Obama’s stated aim of reducing partisanship. Partisan divisions in assessments of presidential performance, for example, are wider now than at any point going back more than six decades, and this growing gap is largely the result of increasing disapproval of the chief executive from the opposition party. An average of just 14% of Republicans have approved of Obama over the course of his presidency, compared with an average of 81% of Democrats.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER Obama’s signature legislative achievement – the 2010 health care law that informally bears his name – has prompted some of the sharpest divisions between Democrats and Republicans. About three-quarters of Democrats approve of the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” while 85% of Republicans disapprove of it. But the partisanship so evident during Obama’s years is perhaps most notable because it extended far beyond disagreements over specific leaders, parties or proposals. Today, more issues cleave along partisan lines than at any point since surveys began to track public opinion. Between 1994 and 2005, for example, Republicans’ and Democrats’ attitudes toward immigrants in the U.S. tracked one another closely. Beginning around 2006, however, they began to diverge. And the gap has only grown wider since then: Democrats today are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say that immigrants strengthen the country. Gun control has long been a partisan issue, with Democrats considerably more likely than Republicans to say it is more important to control gun ownership than protect gun rights. But what was a 27-percentage-point gap between supporters of Obama and John McCain on this question in 2008 surged to a historic 70-point gap between Clinton and Trump supporters in 2016. Climate change marks another area where the parties are deeply divided. Wide partisan divides stretch from the causes and cures for climate change to trust in climate scientists and their research. Only about a fifth of Republicans and independents who lean Republican say they trust climate scientists “a lot” to give full and accurate information about the causes of climate change. This compares with more than half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Skeptical of government, other institutions If views of some issues changed markedly during Obama’s time in office, views of the government did not. Americans’ trust in the federal government remained mired at historic lows. Elected officials were held in such low regard, in fact, that more than half of the public said in a fall 2015 survey that “ordinary Americans” would do a better job of solving national problems. Americans felt disillusioned with the way Washington responded to the financial meltdown of 2008. In 2015, seven-in-ten Americans said that the government’s policies following the recession generally did little or nothing to help middle-class people. A roughly equal share said the government’s post-recession policies did a great deal or a fair amount to help large banks and financial institutions. Against a backdrop of global terrorism – including several attacks on American soil – Americans also became less confident in the ability of their government to handle threats. In 2015, following major attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, the public’s concerns about terrorism surged and positive ratings of the government’s handling of terrorism plummeted to a post-9/11 low. Americans also had serious concerns about privacy, though the government was not the sole focus of skepticism in this respect. During the Obama years, Americans were highly skeptical their personal information would remain private and secure, regardless of whether it was the government or the private sector that collected it. In a 2014 survey, fewer than one-in-ten Americans said they were very confident that each of 11 separate entities – ranging from credit card companies to email providers – would keep their records private and secure. Obama’s election provided an almost immediate boost to America’s global image following the Bush administration and its entanglements in the Middle East. Americans themselves, however, grew more wary of international engagement during Obama’s presidency. In Germany, favorability of the U.S. more than doubled following Obama’s election. In the United Kingdom, confidence in the U.S. president surged from 16% for Bush in 2008 to 86% for Obama in 2009. The Obama bump was most dramatic in Western Europe, but was also evident in virtually every country surveyed between 2007 and 2009. The U.S. retained its popularity in Africa and parts of Latin America during Obama’s second term. But the U.S. wasn’t seen favorably everywhere. Russian views of the U.S. veered sharply negative in 2014 while the image of the U.S. remained dour in key Muslim countries. Meanwhile, certain U.S. actions under Obama, such as drone strikes, eavesdropping on foreign leaders and revelations of torture in the post-9/11 period, were globally unpopular. Americans, meanwhile, have become less certain of their place in the world. The share of Americans who say it would be better if the U.S. just dealt with its own problems and let other countries deal with their own as best they can has risen 11 points since the spring of 2010. The public’s wariness toward global engagement extends to U.S. participation in the global economy and international trade agreements. Roughly half of Americans say U.S. involvement in the global economy is a bad thing because it lowers wages and costs jobs; fewer see it as a good thing because it provides the U.S. with new markets and opportunities for growth. Americans’ views of trade agreements have also soured, a shift driven almost entirely by increasingly negative views among Republicans, especially during the campaign of Trump, who has been highly critical of free trade agreements. About half of Americans say the U.S. is a less powerful and important world leader than it was a decade ago, though most still believe the U.S. is the world’s leading economic and military power. Smartphones and social media If demographic changes are slow, technological changes can be swift. In the new millennium, major technology revolutions have occurred in broadband connectivity, social media use and mobile adoption. All three of them continued, and in some cases accelerated, during Obama’s presidency. More than two-thirds of Americans owned a smartphone by 2015, six times the ownership levels at the dawn of Obama’s tenure. When Apple released the iPad halfway through Obama’s first term, a mere 3% of Americans owned tablets; nearly half had tablets by the end of 2015. Although social media use was a signature aspect of Obama’s 2008 campaign, only one-third of Americans used social media that year. With the rise of Facebook, Twitter and other apps, social media use climbed to about three-quarters of online adults by 2015. Obama also helped usher in the rise of digital video in politics, sharing his weekly address through the White House YouTube channel. By the end of his second term, YouTube had become a media behemoth with over a billion users. How we get our news The rise of digital tools and social platforms has also helped bring about profound changes in the U.S. media landscape. Americans today access information, get news and engage with politicians in new and different ways than in 2008 – a trend underscored by the political success of Trump, whose frequent use of Twitter to communicate directly with supporters (and detractors) was one of the defining narratives of his campaign to succeed Obama. In 2016, more U.S. adults learned about the presidential election through social media than through print newspapers. Younger Americans, in particular, were more likely to turn to social media rather than more traditional platforms, with those ages 18 to 29 listing it as their “most helpful” source for election information in a January 2016 survey. (Cable TV, by contrast, remained among the most helpful sources for all other adults.) The overall American news experience changed significantly during Obama’s years in office. In 2008, relatively few Americans said they got their news through social media or via a smartphone or other mobile device. By 2016, six-in-ten Americans said they got their news through social media and seven-in-ten said they accessed it through a mobile device. Print newspapers continued a long-term decline, with sharp cuts in newspaper staffing and a severe dip in average circulation. Newspaper editorial staff in the U.S. went from nearly 47,000 in 2008 to about 33,000 in 2014 – a 30% drop, according to data from the American Society of News Editors. While television remains a major source of news for Americans, there are signs of change. Viewership of local TV newscasts has been flat or declining for years, depending on the time of day. Between 2007 and 2015, average viewership for late-night newscasts declined 22%, according to analysis of Nielsen Media Research data. Overall, Americans remained extremely wary of the news media. In a 2016 survey, seven-in-ten adults said the media has a “negative effect” on the way things are going in the U.S. today – the highest share of any nongovernmental institution polled. Nearly three-quarters said in a separate survey that the news media are biased. But for all the skepticism facing the media, Americans continued to value the watchdog functions of the press. About eight-in-ten registered voters, for example, said it is the news media’s responsibility to fact-check political candidates and campaigns. Three-in-four said that news organizations keep political leaders from doing things they shouldn’t. The future of the media is likely to be an even more salient question following the 2016 presidential campaign, which saw the emergence of a trend of “fake news” that has caused some observers to say that America has entered a period of “post-truth politics.” While the 2016 election may be one for the history books, looking ahead requires equal measures of caution and humility, particularly when it comes to politics and public policy. It remains to be seen, for example, whether Donald Trump will push forward on some of his highest-profile campaign priorities, such as constructing a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, lowering federal taxes and reducing government regulation. On some of his priorities, Trump appears to have the support of the public; on others, he appears to be out of step with public sentiment. Either way, history suggests that opinion can change significantly as general proposals move to concrete legislation. Still, there are certain bigger trends we know are going to continue and others that show no signs of reversing. The technological changes that were such a hallmark of Obama’s eight years will go on, constantly reshaping the way we communicate, the way we travel, the way we shop and the way we work, among many other facets of everyday life. Americans seem to expect major changes: More than six-in-ten, for example, believe that within 50 years, robots or computers will do much of the work that is currently done by humans. The demographic changes that have taken hold across the U.S. will continue their transformation of America, too. The nation as a whole will turn grayer and its racial and ethnic diversification is expected to continue: In less than 40 years, the U.S. will not have a single racial or ethnic majority group, according to Pew Research Center projections. The U.S. has also long been home to more immigrants than any other country in the world, and by 2065, one-in-three Americans will be an immigrant or have immigrant parents, compared with about one-in-four today. The nation’s stark partisan fissures are likely to persist and may deepen. Just as Obama’s job approval ratings are deeply divided along partisan lines, the public’s ratings for how Trump has handled his transition to the White House are more divided by party than they were for recent presidents-elect. A reality of American politics today is that one of the only things large numbers of Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that they can’t agree on basic facts. The foreign policy challenges facing this politically fractured nation seem endless, from Russia and China to terrorism and the environment. At home, financial prosperity – even stability – feels increasingly out of reach to many Americans: Today, far more people are pessimistic than optimistic about life for the next generation of Americans. Yet the United States enters this uncertain new era with undeniable, if often overlooked, strengths. Republicans and Democrats, for example, differ dramatically over whether the nation has gotten more or less powerful as a global leader over the past decade, but majorities in both parties say the U.S. is still the world’s leading military – and yes, economic – power. And most Americans say that one of the hallmarks of U.S. society – its racial and ethnic diversity – makes the country a better place to live. It is tempting to believe that the pace of change in the U.S. has never been greater, or that 2016’s election is of greater consequence than others. As significant as the current moment of transition is, however, only the passage of time can reveal the trends that will truly have lasting importance.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-acosta-press-pass-white-house-cnn_us_5bf26dcae4b07573881fe2c1---split---CNN on Monday sought an emergency court hearing after White House officials said they would again revoke reporter Jim Acosta’s recently returned press credentials. The cable network filed a request in U.S. District Court seeking a hearing on a preliminary injunction to block the new White House threat to remove Acosta, a frequent foil for President Donald Trump’s anti-press rhetoric. CNN’s filing aims to protect Acosta’s access until the network’s lawsuit against the Trump administration for yanking Acosta’s credentials is decided. The renewed White House threat, delivered in a letter to Acosta on Friday ― hours after a judge issued a temporary order that Acosta’s credentials be returned for 14 days ― was an attempt by the Trump administration “to provide retroactive due process,” CNN’s lawyers said in Monday’s court filing, obtained by BuzzFeed. The White House is “yet again … violating the constitutional rights of CNN and Acosta,” the attorneys wrote. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine’s letter to Acosta said they made a “preliminary decision to suspend [his] hard pass due to [his] conduct” during a testy Nov. 7 Trump news conference. The letter, CNN said, was sent just hours after U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly issued the temporary order requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the reporter’s credentials. The letter said Acosta would be allowed to keep his press pass while the order was in effect. It added that Acosta would need to reply to by 5 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 18, if he wished to contest the preliminary decision to re-suspend his credentials after the order lifts. “Should you not submit a response by that time, this preliminary decision will be final,” the letter states. Sanders and Shine alleged that Acosta failed to abide by “basic, widely understood practices” during the presidential press conference, though they acknowledged the White House does not currently “have a written code of conduct for journalists.” CNN sued the Trump administration following Acosta’s ouster, accusing the White House of violating the network and Acosta’s First and Fifth Amendment rights. Kelly, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year, agreed with CNN that Acosta’s right to due process had likely been violated in the abrupt and opaque way he was stripped of his credentials. CNN’s Brian Stelter, who shared news of the White House’s latest correspondence with Acosta in his “Reliable Sources” newsletter, suggested the Trump administration may now be attempting to establish a “paper trail” that could pass for due process. “From the looks of the letter, the [White House] is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month,” Stelter wrote.

---split---9.0---split---https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-trump-approval-remains-high-in-senate-battleground-states---split---This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. President Trump returns to the campaign trail with rallies in eight states before Election Day, including several states that he won in 2016 where Democrats are fighting to hold onto Senate seats. A new round of Fox News battleground state polls proves we don’t call them battlegrounds for nothing. With six days until the election, three of the five U.S. Senate races could go either way -- and while Republicans hold leads in the other two, Democratic enthusiasm could still close the gap. President Trump’s approval rating is at or above 50 percent in all. Yet in only two, North Dakota and Tennessee, does a GOP Senate candidate hit 50 percent support. In two other states, Arizona and Missouri, the candidates are tied. The race in Indiana has reversed since early September -- however, one in five voters there who currently back a candidate say they may still change their mind. No doubt, there will still be movement during the campaign’s final days. Here are the state-by-state results, starting with Arizona: Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally tie at 46 percent apiece among Arizona likely voters. Sinema was up by two points in early October and by three in September. Hispanics prefer Sinema by 29 points, while rural whites favor McSally by 27. CLICK FOR FULL ARIZONA POLL RESULTS "Sinema's nearly two-to-one advantage among Hispanics means slightly higher Hispanic turnout than in the past could tip the race to the Democrat -- but the data doesn’t suggest a surge,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. The survey finds the number of Hispanic voters extremely interested in the election trails interest among non-Hispanic whites by 15 points. Both Sinema (88 percent) and McSally supporters (88 percent) have a high degree of vote certainty, and equal numbers of Democrats (50 percent) and Republicans (50 percent) are extremely interested in the election. Ninety-three percent of Democrats back Sinema, while 85 percent of Republicans support McSally. More Arizona voters identify as Republican than as Democrat by 10 points. Five percent are still undecided about their vote in the Senate race. The candidates are competing for the open seat of retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Trump won Arizona by nearly four points. Currently, 52 percent of Arizona likely voters approve of the job he is doing, and 81 percent of Trump approvers are for McSally. In the governor’s race, Republican incumbent Doug Ducey leads Democrat David Garcia by a comfortable 55-37 percent. Indiana Incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly bests Republican challenger Mike Braun by seven points among Indiana likely voters, 45-38 percent. His lead is at the poll’s margin of error. The race shifted since September when Braun was up by two points. In early October, Donnelly was up by two. Donnelly’s edge comes in large part from greater party loyalty and higher interest in the election among Democrats. Fully 88 percent of Democrats back him vs. 80 percent of Republicans for Braun. In addition, nearly 1 in 10 Republicans go for Donnelly. Independents are about twice as likely to support the incumbent. CLICK FOR FULL INDIANA POLL RESULTS More Democrats (49 percent) than Republicans (43 percent) are extremely interested in the race. Eighty-three percent of Donnelly supporters and 80 percent of Braun supporters feel certain of their vote choice. Nine percent of Indiana likely voters are undecided. Libertarian Lucy Breton takes five percent and that could be a wild card. "Republican voters who flirt with Libertarian candidates tend to come home to the Republican candidate in the last few days,” says Shaw. He adds, “Donnelly being under 50 percent bodes well for the less well-known challenger." While Trump won Indiana by 19 points, more voters currently approve (50 percent) than disapprove (48 percent) of the job he is doing by just 2. In early September, more approved than disapproved by 10 (54-44 percent). Missouri The Missouri Senate race is a toss-up. Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill and her Republican challenger Josh Hawley tie at 43 percent apiece. Another four percent support another candidate, and nine percent are undecided. CLICK FOR FULL MISSOURI POLL RESULTS The race was also tied, 43-43 percent, at the beginning of October. McCaskill has a 10-point advantage in party support: 93 percent of Democrats back her compared to 83 percent of Republicans going for Hawley. The preference among independents splits. Men break for Hawley by four points. Women favor McCaskill by three. Whites with a college degree support McCaskill by 6 points, while whites without a degree go for Hawley by 16. More Democrats than Republicans are extremely interested in the election (55 vs. 48 percent respectively). The candidates also tie in a hypothetical two-way matchup: 45-45 percent. Among the subgroup of extremely interested voters, Hawley is up by three points in the two-way matchup, while McCaskill is up by one point in the expansive ballot. Fifty-four percent of Missouri likely voters approve of Trump’s job performance, which nearly matches his 57 percent of the vote in 2016. Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn is pulling away from Democrat Phil Bredesen in the race to fill retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker’s seat. She is preferred 50-41 percent over the former governor among Tennessee likely voters. That 9-point lead is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error. She was up by five points in early October. CLICK FOR FULL TENNESSEE POLL RESULTS Blackburn’s advantage comes despite more Democrats (55 percent) than Republicans (48 percent) being extremely interested in the election -- as well as greater party loyalty among Democrats. Fully 92 percent of Democrats back Bredesen vs. 87 percent of Republicans supporting Blackburn. It helps Blackburn that more Tennesseans identify as Republicans by a nearly 20-point margin. There is a 35-point gender gap: women back Bredesen by 7 points and men support Blackburn by 28. Eighty-eight percent of each candidate’s backers feel certain they will stick with their pick. Trump remains popular in the Volunteer State. He won 61 percent of the vote here, and 58 percent approve of his job performance. In the Tennessee governor’s race, Republican Bill Lee leads Democrat Karl Dean by 54-37 percent. Eleven percent of those backing Bredesen cross party lines to support Lee. North Dakota Democratic incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp trails Republican Kevin Cramer by nine points. Cramer garners 51 percent to Heitkamp’s 42 percent among North Dakota likely voters. In early October, Cramer had a 12-point lead (53-41 percent). Even though the race has narrowed a bit, it is the second time the Fox News poll shows him above 50 percent. Cramer’s lead is outside the margin of error. CLICK FOR FULL NORTH DAKOTA POLL RESULTS In a state that went for Trump by 36 points, Heitkamp is able to keep the race as close as it is thanks to greater support among Democrats. Ninety-four percent of Democrats back Heitkamp. Support for Cramer among Republicans stands at 85 percent. The vote preference among independents goes in Heitkamp’s favor by a narrow three points. Many more North Dakotans identify as Republican than as Democrat. There is a 22-point gender gap, as Heitkamp is the choice for women by 1 point and men go for Cramer by 21. By a 5-point margin, more Democrats (56 percent) than Republicans (51 percent) feel extremely interested in the election. Among Cramer supporters, 92 percent feel sure they will vote for him, while 88 percent of Heitkamp supporters say the same. Four percent are undecided about their Senate vote, and eight percent who currently support a candidate feel they could change their mind. Heitkamp outperforms the other Democrat on the ballot this year. Mac Schneider is running against Republican Kelly Armstrong to take the state’s lone House seat vacated by Cramer. Armstrong leads by 55-33 percent. Sixty-one percent of North Dakota likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing. He won 63 percent of the vote in 2016. The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted October 27-30, 2018 by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among likely voters in Indiana (722), Missouri (741), North Dakota (789) and Tennessee (718). Results based on the full sample of likely voters in each state except North Dakota have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. ND is plus or minus three points. Registered voters were randomly selected from a statewide voter file (except in ND where all eligible voters were included), and respondents answered screening questions about their likelihood to vote in the November elections. For Arizona, it is October 27-29 and 643 likely voters, plus or minus 3.5 points. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on Donald Trump's tweets attacking special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Donald Trump is so ticked off at Robert Mueller that he's calling him an Obama guy. The special counsel is actually a registered Republican. The president's eruption on Twitter yesterday fueled all kinds of media chatter about whether Mueller, who seems to be in the final phases of his Russia investigation, is about to drop some major indictment. Maybe the president is just worked up because, according to news accounts, he's spent the last several days with his lawyers, hammering out written answers to Mueller's questions. (Does this mean there won’t be a face-to-face interview? Who knows?) What I'm hearing from the White House is that the president is simply sick of the long-running investigation and, after conferring with his lawyers, wants to bring it to a head. Trump has made his "witch hunt" allegations for much of the Mueller probe.And by the way, it’s hardly unprecedented to try to investigate those who are investigating you. Bill Clinton and his allies mounted a sustained campaign to demonize Ken Starr. But Trump's attacks yesterday may be his harshest yet. "The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess," Trump tweeted. "They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. "They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't care how many lives the [sic] ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!" The all-caps was just for emphasis. The president can certainly argue that Mueller, even with his charges against Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and others, has come up with no evidence of collusion with Russia. But keep in mind that it was Trump's own appointee, Rod Rosenstein, who named Mueller as special counsel, and the deputy attorney general says he's doing a good job. What's more, it was George W. Bush who tapped Mueller as FBI director. Obama just let him finish out his 10-year term, and tacked on an additional two years. So to suggest that Mueller is some kind of Obama loyalist is just wrong. One aspect that the pundits are focusing on is that the latest attack on Mueller comes after the president replaced Jeff Sessions with Matt Whitaker, who has a history of criticizing the special counsel. But whether the acting attorney general will take any steps to curtail the probe remains to be seen. By outward appearances, Mueller seems to be down to third-level players. The Wall Street Journal reports that he is investigating whether veteran GOP operative Roger Stone tried to intimidate a witness who is contradicting his insistence he had no pipeline to WikiLeaks on the hacked Democratic emails. In emails to his former friend, Randy Credico, the Journal says, Stone threatened to "sue the f---" out of him and called Credico "a loser a liar and a rat." But this is pretty small potatoes. The president also weighed in on the press yesterday, as he is wont to do. I reported yesterday on a spate of stories (The Washington Post, L.A. Times, Politico) about how Trump has been angry, furious and lashing out since the midterms as he mulls another White House shakeup. Insiders tell me that many of the leaks likely emanate from places such as the Homeland Security Department and National Security Council, where people's jobs are threatened (such as Kirstjen Nielsen and deputy NSC director Mira Ricardel, who's being transferred after Melania Trump called for her firing). The president often discusses job changes with advisers and doesn't mind the rumors that float around and hit the press. Trump tweeted yesterday: "The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!" I mean, why would anyone think he's angry? But the president does have a point that routine personnel moves after an election are getting the media’s "chaos" treatment — even if "running very smoothly" is not the most apt description of this White House.

Let’s not fall for it. By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. A new week, a new opportunity to dissect President Trump’s forays into the art of the personal insult. By now, most people are familiar with the president’s habit of slagging the physical, mental and moral fitness of his detractors. From “Crooked Hillary” Clinton to “Psycho Joe” Scarborough to “low energy” Jeb Bush to “crazy,” “unhinged,” “low IQ” Maxine Waters — Mr. Trump adheres to the belief that, if you’re going to go low, you should get as personal and elemental as possible. This weekend provided a particularly redolent example, as the president, perhaps still vibrating from his overconsumption of the Sunday news shows, hit back at a bit of displeasing commentary by Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, with this scatological twit fit: So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate! Quicker than you can say “White House decorum,” Mr. Trump’s remarks became the talk of social media. Did the president really just call the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that? If it was a typo, he didn’t bother to delete the tweet and correct it, as he often does. In any case, doesn’t Mr. Trump realize how childish he sounds? How rude? How unpresidential? “I feel like I’m back in seventh grade here, where we have juvenile name-calling,” Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat, marveled to CNN. “We’re talking about protecting the rule of law, and the best the president can do is start calling people names.” Trolling the libs with serial outrages — just for, one might say, schiffs and giggles — is a source of endless delight for Mr. Trump. It is also central to his survival strategy: The president burnishes the swaggering, politically incorrect persona that thrills his base, even as he siphons attention away from the substance of the real outrages that his administration is perpetrating on a near-daily basis. Who has time to focus on the finer points of trade policy or prescription drug costs or the continuing assault on democratic institutions when the leader of the free world is tweeting bathroom humor? This is how Mr. Trump rolls. And if you think he has been over-the-top while his Republican enablers have controlled all of Congress, just wait until the Democrats take over the House in January. This president has repeatedly made clear that he considers himself above the law and accountable to no one. He is unlikely to greet Democratic efforts at oversight with any sort of restraint. Expect the nicknames to get nastier and the attacks more gratuitous. Mr. Trump thrives down in the mud and is eager to drag his opposition down with him. Over the past two years, there has been much talk about the risk of the public becoming exhausted by Mr. Trump’s constant outrages — of allowing him to normalize bad, dangerous behavior. That remains a risk, but only if we continue to let his potty mouth consume so much public attention. Mr. Trump’s critics should continue fighting fiercely against his attempts — on Twitter and off — to undermine the rule of law, to rig the system in favor of himself and his cronies and to take down not only the Constitution but also quite possibly, if he gets the chance, the Ptolemaic model, Newton’s Law, and maybe even the Pythagorean theorem in order to establish himself as the sole arbiter of truth. But as for his vulgarity and petty personal insults: In the grand scheme of things, who really gives a Schitt?

By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Make no mistake: The 2020 presidential race has already begun. It began before the ballots were fully counted from the midterms, and for some presidential hopefuls, it started even earlier. People are already making the obligatory pilgrimages to Iowa and New Hampshire. In fact, NBC10 Boston and New England Cable News have been tracking visits to New Hampshire by politicians who might run in 2020, and by their count, as of Nov. 13, Maryland Congressman John Delaney, who has already declared his candidacy and already has a campaign website, leads the pack with 35 visits (each city visited counts as a separate visit, even if it’s on the same day as another city). Next on that list of visitors are Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator from Oregon; former Maryland governor and 2016 candidate Martin O’Malley; the former Missouri secretary of state, Jason Kander; Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan; Senator Bernie Sanders; and Julián Castro, Barack Obama’s housing secretary. As Politico reported in June, nine prospective candidates, including Senators Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and the former Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, had met with Obama in one-on-one meetings. Loyalists are prodding reluctant candidates and also-rans to enter the fray or return to it. Last week, Mark Penn, a pollster and adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton in previous elections, co-wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal under the headline “Hillary Will Run Again.” As the article put it: Get ready for Hillary Clinton 4.0. More than 30 years in the making, this new version of Mrs. Clinton, when she runs for president in 2020, will come full circle — back to the universal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand of 1994. True to her name, Mrs. Clinton will fight this out until the last dog dies. She won’t let a little thing like two stunning defeats stand in the way of her claim to the White House. Other people are looking at another side of the field: Money. Donald Trump has already raised an unprecedented amount of money for his re-election bid. According to a report last month from the Center for Responsive Politics, “Since January 2017, Trump’s fund-raising efforts totaled $106 million, and the president finished September with nearly $47 million on hand.” For comparison, the group pointed out how this outpaces Trump’s predecessors: “President Barack Obama raised $4 million and only had $2.3 million on hand at the halfway point of his first term in 2010. In 2002, President George W. Bush raised $3.2 million and had $2.8 million.” As The Washington Post reported in July: More than two dozen people are in the process of exploring campaigns to take out President Trump, but only a handful have the relationships with wealthy donors, significant personal wealth or small-dollar fund-raising apparatus to raise the early money needed to mount a traditional campaign. The early advantage goes to those who hail from wealthy states, with broad networks of donors, such as California and New York, and those who will start the race with a national brand and large email lists of supporters. Five Thirty Eight last month lined up the people they said were “basically running right now” even if “some of them end up never launching full-blown campaigns.” Names on that list were: Lawyer Michael Avenatti; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; Mr. Biden; New Jersey Senator Cory Booker; Mr. Castro; Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti; New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand; California Senator Kamala Harris; Former Attorney General Eric Holder; former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu; Senator Merkley; Mr. O’Malley; Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; Representative Ryan; Senator Sanders; Representative Eric Swalwell of California; businessman and pro-impeachment activist Tom Steyer; Senator Warren. Throngs are considering a candidacy. We understand the ambitions, but what about what the country actually needs? We are in the middle of nothing short of an ideological civil war in this country. People’s interests, inclinations and sources of information are so divergent that they are diametrically opposed. Not all of that can be healed, but some of it must be. We can’t continue with half the nation viewing the other half as enemies. Yes, we need someone to restore truth, decency and decorum to the presidency, but we also need someone who can lead a post-Trump reconstruction of civil society in which those who are willing can walk away from Trumpism and back into a more normal political reality. Welcoming back prodigal partisans, those who have excused or forgiven or even cheered hatred, misogyny, racism and division, is easier said than done, and requires a special caliber of leader. The natural inclination of many, somewhat understandably, is simply to be a tougher Trump than Trump, but that inevitably reduces the candidate and the country. America doesn’t need a liberal Trump; it needs precisely the opposite of that. Before we in our parlor games settle on who has the best shot of winning, let’s examine our lists for the candidates who represent our best hope for restoration.

---split---10.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jim-acosta-cnn-press-conference_us_5be320bee4b0769d24c83bf2---split---President Donald Trump tore into CNN’s Jim Acosta during a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, attacking the reporter as a “rude, terrible person.” Acosta had refused to sit down after asking the president about a racist, anti-immigration ad his re-election campaign had paid for and promoted ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday. A White House aide tried to grab the microphone from Acosta, but the CNN reporter refused to give it up, infuriating the president. “I’ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,” Trump scolded Acosta. “You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn’t be working for CNN.” NBC’s Peter Alexander, the next reporter chosen to ask a question, defended his beleaguered colleague. “In Jim’s defense, I’ve traveled with him, he’s a hard-working, diligent reporter,” Alexander told the president. Many thanks to my friend @PeterAlexander https://t.co/jCl1g8CHQL Trump later accused CNN of “voter suppression,” citing its election polling ahead of the midterm elections. It’s unclear how he believes the network’s projections led to voter suppression. The president has repeatedly accused CNN and other media outlets of producing “fake news” and has attacked them as “the enemy of the people,” even days after a pipe bomb was sent to the outlet’s office. “It’s such a hostile media,” Trump said at the press conference. “So sad.” Trump also went after PBS’ Yamiche Alcindor when she started to ask whether his decision to call himself “a nationalist” may have emboldened white nationalists. “I don’t know why you’d say that, such a racist question,” Trump said to Alcindor, who is black. “I don’t believe that, I don’t believe it. To say that, what you said, is so insulting to me.” I asked President Trump what he thinks of people seeing his rhetoric as emboldening white nationalists and whether he was concerned that Republicans would be seen as supporting white nationalists. His response: "That's a racist question." I'm simply asking the questions the public wants to know. https://t.co/bZ1cZVBKhd CNN released a statement slamming Trump’s “dangerous” rhetoric minutes after the tense press conference came to a close. “This President’s ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far,” the statement read. “They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.” The statement continued: “While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.” CNN’s response to @realDonaldTrump’s press conference today: pic.twitter.com/tJ3nZDnYwO This has been updated to include CNN’s statement.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the press coverage of recent staff shakeups at the White House and leaks by those surrounding Trump that portray him as angry and lashing out. It's like we're back in the spring of 2017: Looming staff shakeups! The chief of staff may be out! The White House is in chaos. Nobody can rein in Donald Trump! And once again, those surrounding Trump are leaking like crazy. But a bit of perspective here: Presidents usually shake up their teams after midterm elections — especially losing midterm elections — and some officials naturally decide it's time to move on. With the exception of the firing of Jeff Sessions — given the controversial pick of his anti-Mueller interim replacement, Matt Whitaker — I don't know why the press needs to treat every rumor of a White House or Cabinet change as the coming of the apocalypse. But the planned staff moves are morphing into a larger narrative of an angry president lashing out and blowing off some of his duties while his staff is steaming, according to reports in The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Politico. There's not much question that Trump has seemed more aggressive and aggrieved since the Democrats captured the House (their haul is now up to 33 seats and counting). Even Melania has gotten in on the shakeup action. Insiders tell me the president is unhappy, disappointed in some top aides, and ready to make changes. He has also, in my view, made some missteps in the process. But does this add up to a portrait of an out-of-control leader? When The Washington Post quotes historian Doug Brinkley as saying "he's just a bull carrying his own china shop with him," is that bull? The president felt compelled to hit back in the face of these stories, tweeting this morning: "The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!" The Post piece on "five days of fury" ranges from a testy Trump call with Theresa May to skipping a planned World War I remembrance at a cemetery in France. "Trump quickly grew infuriated by a torrent of tweets and media coverage suggesting that the president was afraid of the rain and did not respect veterans ... "The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron's public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack." It also ranges from Trump tweeting about "FRAUD" in the Florida elections to the revoking of Jim Acosta's credentials to the president telling CNN reporter Abby Phillip that she asks "stupid questions." The L.A. Times has a similar story about a "brooding" Trump: "The president has lashed out at several aides, from junior press assistants to senior officials. 'He's furious,' said one administration official. 'Most staffers are trying to avoid him.'" Politico, like the other outlets, deals with possible personnel moves, zeroing in on "bottled-up hostility" and "a fresh round of backbiting" among the staff. The president has told others he wants to dump Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security chief, which has been obvious as he has blamed her for problems at the border. And he is once again said to be weighing the departure of John Kelly (in favor of Mike Pence's top aide Nick Ayers). We have been through endless rounds of chatter about Kelly, which seemed to end when the president announced he's staying through 2020. So it's not clear whether this will blow over. But then came what is truly a bizarre spectacle. Melania Trump took on deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel with this public statement: "It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House." (The Wall Street Journal reported that Ricardel was gone, then retracted it, and the situation is now unclear.) Many first ladies, including Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton, have obviously had a strong influence on their husband and gotten staffers fired. But to put out a statement is beyond unusual, prompting speculation that Melania was trying to accomplish privately what she failed to do behind the scenes. So it's a tumultuous time for the president, no question. But keep in mind that those leaking all these anecdotes to journalists may have their own agendas.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. The White House tells Fox News that President Trump is willing to work across the aisle with the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. It was 9:31 in the east when Fox News, President Trump's favorite network, projected the outcome he wanted least: the Democrats would take control of the House. And that changes everything. It wasn't quite a blue wave, but enough districts turned blue to end the Republicans' total control of Washington, marking a turning point in the Trump presidency. And the media will cast Tuesday's outcome as a rejection of Trumpism, which will be the subject of endless cable segments and op-ed arguments. Trump was always going to own the midterm results, win or lose. The media were going to cast it as a referendum on his presidency regardless, and he embraced that notion, saying he was practically on the ballot, nationalizing the contests around such issues as immigration and spending the final weeks in a blitz of interviews and campaign rallies. It had been a surprisingly low-key evening until the Fox call, with no major upsets, other than Beto O'Rourke staying even with Ted Cruz before falling short. Even James Carville said his party was not in for as good a night as he had hoped. But the Democrats gradually picked up one House seat after another of the 23 they needed to take control. It would be nearly an hour until MSNBC would join in projecting a Republican loss of House control. The previously powerless Democrats now wield at least some power in the nation’s capital, which could mean two years of gridlock, unless the president and opposition party decide it's in their self-interest to cooperate on certain issues. No amount of spin can soften the blow of losing the House to the Democrats. Indeed, there were reports that White House officials had told the president to brace himself for a very tough night. And even in the 8 p.m. hour, with many races too close or too early to call, some pundits were already talking about how Nancy Pelosi's troops could make life difficult for the administration with a blizzard of investigations and subpoenas. The Republicans held the Senate, and Trump was poised to take credit, though that was practically pre-ordained, given a map that mainly featured Democrats trying to hang on in red states, as North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp failed to do. But politics is a game of expectations, and all the media chatter about a blue tsunami came to seem premature. That may be because political races always tighten at the end, and in part because Trump succeeded in mobilizing his conservative base. The president's tactics — especially his focus on immigration, the caravan and birthright citizenship — were widely denounced by the media in the final stretch. Trump was accused in news stories of using fear-mongering and racially charged divisiveness to rile up his supporters. While the president's rhetoric did get uncomfortably hot at times, and several networks rejected an immigration ad as racist, many in the media also fueled the divisiveness with attacks on the president. But when the media sages said the president should tout the booming economy, he countered that the subject was unexciting when people were doing well and focused on the more emotional subject of illegal immigration. What happened to Trump in his first midterm is hardly unique. Barack Obama suffered the same fate in 2010 and 2014, and George W. Bush in 2006. Both took office with full party control of Congress and both lost it. Donald Trump remains the dominant figure in American politics. But for the first time since the early-morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016, the Democrats have something to cheer about.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why CNN's lawsuit against Trump is more about a PR battle than the law. Much of the news business is rushing to embrace CNN for taking legal action against President Trump. The suit casts CNN President Jeff Zucker as a champion of press freedom, standing up to a president who is accused of violating the First Amendment. But by taking the president to court, CNN also reinforces its image among millions of Trump supporters as part of the opposition. And the suit isn't going to get Jim Acosta's credentials restored any time soon, if at all. Bob Woodward said at a conference that CNN was taking Trump's "bait," and he's right. But the network, in choosing to revive the Acosta controversy that was starting to die down, clearly likes the narrative. "The First Amendment grants the right of all journalists to hold those in power accountable and ask tough questions," Zucker said in a statement. But Sarah Sanders dismissed the lawsuit as "more grandstanding by CNN," noting that the White House has credentialed nearly 50 other staffers from the network. She said Trump had already answered two of Acosta's questions at a presser last week before the reporter "physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions." And that, Sanders said, wasn't the first time that Acosta had acted "inappropriately." (When Trump held his first presser last year, Acosta tried to interrupt by shouting questions after the president-elect had dissed CNN, and he refused to call on the correspondent.) But Sanders notably declined to repeat her earlier charge that Acosta was suspended because he had "laid hands" on the White House intern sent to take his mic. The CNN suit calls that false, and video of the episode shows only glancing contact. The network is seeking an injunction because "every day that his pass has been revoked is a First Amendment violation and it's irreparable harm in the words of the law," CNN lawyer Ted Boutros said on its air. The suit is likely to drag on for months and is more about the high-stakes PR war between the two sides than resolving constitutional issues. By going to court, CNN reframes the fight and deflects attention from Acosta's conduct to lofty principles. Even some of his White House press colleagues believe Acosta is a showman who takes an activist's approach to the job — he was lecturing Trump on the migrant caravan — and appeared rude when he kept on talking and interrupting. He's hardly the best poster boy for the First Amendment. The president, who knew what he was getting when he called on Acosta, also gets use the correspondent and his network as a whipping boy in his assault on so-called "fake news." In fact, the lawsuit lists his previous clashes with Acosta, his criticism of CNN (including the famous wrestling video) and Trump's dismissal of CNN host Don Lemon as the "dumbest" guy on television. Each side, in other words, is playing to its base. Things have gotten rather personal between Zucker, who ran NBC when Trump was doing "The Apprentice," and the president, who clearly feels betrayed by the abundance of negative coverage on Zucker’s network. The fact that Zucker was a guest at Trump's wedding to Melania feels like ancient history. I suppose it's possible that this suit will break new constitutional ground, but the great likelihood is that it will drag on for many months and do nothing to help Acosta. CNN has other White House reporters, but news organizations have an understandable conviction that no politician should be able to dictate who covers him. But the risk for CNN, beyond big legal fees — the team includes Ted Olson — is that the network may be painting itself as part of the resistance. Perhaps both sides are getting what they want. CNN has the backing of the White House Correspondents Association. Trump has the backing of millions of people who believe he's being treated terribly by the MSM. And while Jim Acosta may not have his hard pass, he's become famous. Maybe CNN should just let him host an opinion show since he's got so many of them.

It was, for once, a predictable bombshell. And met by equally predictable waves of media outrage. Was there anyone in America, paying the slightest bit of attention, who didn't know that President Trump was going to fire Jeff Sessions after the midterms? I mean, the president has practically been announcing it with a bullhorn. Sure, we didn't know it was going to happen the day after the Democrats won control of the House (although George W. Bush ousted Don Rumsfeld the day after an even more disastrous election). But come on. Trump didn't even bother to hide the motive. He has been angry at his attorney general for a year and a half for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. In truth, Sessions had no choice. As a senator, he was a campaign surrogate for Trump and wound up being questioned on the Hill over his own contacts with Russian officials. But Trump viewed this as a personal betrayal, and said so, repeatedly. He said it on Twitter. He said it in an interview with The New York Times. He said it in encounters with reporters. He called Sessions weak and beleaguered. He insisted the Justice Department should be investigating Democrats. Someone even leaked word that Trump privately called his own appointee Mr. Magoo. It was humiliating, but Sessions hung in there, doing his job, although he knew his days were numbered. He said right there in his resignation letter that he was quitting at the president's request. But what really fueled the media’s "crisis" coverage was Trump's choice for acting attorney general. It wasn't Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, the man who appointed Robert Mueller. It was Sessions' chief of staff, Matt Whitaker. Whitaker is a former prosecutor, as well as a conservative activist, but he is obscure. He is a Trump loyalist, once described as the president's "eyes and ears" at DOJ. What's more, as a CNN contributor and at other times, he has trashed the Mueller investigation that he will now be overseeing. He's suggesting that Justice could curtail the special counsel's probe by cutting his funding. "The truth is there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign," Whitaker once said. As for the left, "the last thing they want right now is for the truth to come out, and for the fact that there's not a single piece of evidence that demonstrates that the Trump campaign had any illegal or any improper relationships with the Russians. It's that simple." So Whitaker has, to put it mildly, a rather dim view of the investigation. And his associates are telling reporters he has no intention of recusing himself. Of course not — that's why Trump wants him. So it's a big deal that oversight of the Russia probe is moving from Rosenstein, who likes the job Mueller is doing, to a man who's been so critical of the investigation. And criticism from House Democrats who'll soon be in a position to scrutinize these matters is fueling the story. But a couple of cautionary notes. Whitaker hasn't done anything to impede the investigation since his appointment was announced. And it's possible, if only as a matter of political strategy, that he may not. It's also possible, amid reports that Mueller is writing his report, that his prosecutors haven't found any evidence of collusion, or obstruction, and he'll be wrapping up soon. Sessions has been toast for a long time. Whitaker could do something to cause a crisis, at least until a permanent AG (Chris Christie?) is named. But unless and until there's an effort to rein in Mueller, the media might avoid keeping this cranked up to an 11.

---split---12.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-continues-squabble-commander-raid-killed-bin-laden/story?id=59292596---split---President Donald Trump continues to squabble with retired Adm. William McRaven, the commander of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, now falsely claiming credit in a tweet for pointing out the terrorist’s name in a book he authored before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!..  Here's how the back-and-forth is unfolding.  Trump’s tweet is an apparent reference to a book he authored in 2000, titled "The America We Deserve," where the future president criticizes President Bill Clinton’s shifting national security policy. In the book's sole Bin Laden reference, Trump only briefly mentions the terrorist leader and does not fully address the scope of the threat he posed.   “Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flashpoints, standoffs, and hot spots. We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess — one master against many rivals,” Trump wrote. “One day we’re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it’s on to a new enemy and new crisis.”  In his second tweet, Trump boasts about cutting off military aid to Pakistan. In September, the Pentagon canceled a remaining pot of $300 million bound for Pakistan, bringing the total in military assistance cuts to $800 million this year.  ....We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That’s ENDING!  That's financial aid that the U.S. had traditionally reimbursed to Pakistan for military spending to hunt militants. The Trump administration says it is withholding that money because Pakistan has done little to end the safe haven there for terrorist groups operating in the region.   The State Department’s assistance to Pakistan is less, contributing to programs that support economic development, education and social services, and democracy and human rights promotions. In FY 2018, the State Department shelled out $337 million to Pakistan, a cut representing nearly half of the $631 million it received in FY 2017, and down from a high of $691 million in FY 2015, according to the department's foreign assistance tracker.  Trump initially slammed McRaven as a "Hillary Clinton fan" during an interview with Fox News that aired this weekend, contending it would have been nice if bin Laden had been captured sooner. “Wouldn’t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn’t it have been nice?” Trump asked rhetorically, emphasizing that bin Laden lived in a “mansion” in Abbottabad, Pakistan. “But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.” McRaven responded to Trump’s comments on Fox News, denying that he backed any candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign while standing by his previous comments that the president's attack on the media is the greatest threat to U.S. democracy.   "I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else," McRaven noted. "I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the nation together in challenging times." "I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime," McRaven continued. "When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression, then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands." Last August, McRaven defended former CIA director John Brennan after Trump revoked his security clearance, writing a critical op-ed for the Washington Post where he asked the president to revoke his own security clearance in solidarity with Brennan, also a frequent critic of the president. "Few Americans have done more to protect this country than John. He is a man of unparalleled integrity, whose honesty and character have never been in question, except by those who don’t know him," McRaven wrote. "Therefore, I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency." McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, led the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014 before retiring from the military. Days after he asked Trump to revoke his security clearance, McRaven resigned from his position with the Defense Innovation Board, an advisory committee of former Defense senior officials who make recommendations on future projects and technologies. Trump has not revoked McRaven’s security clearance. ABC News' Conor Finnegan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.
---split---12.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  By Andrew Mercer, Claudia Deane and Kyley McGeeney The results of Tuesday’s presidential election came as a surprise to nearly everyone who had been following the national and state election polling, which consistently projected Hillary Clinton as defeating Donald Trump. Relying largely on opinion polls, election forecasters put Clinton’s chance of winning at anywhere from 70% to as high as 99%, and pegged her as the heavy favorite to win a number of states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that in the end were taken by Trump. How could the polls have been so wrong about the state of the election? There is a great deal of speculation but no clear answers as to the cause of the disconnect, but there is one point of agreement: Across the board, polls underestimated Trump’s level of support. With few exceptions, the final round of public polling showed Clinton with a lead of 1 to 7 percentage points in the national popular vote. State-level polling was more variable, but there were few instances where polls overstated Trump’s support. The fact that so many forecasts were off-target was particularly notable given the increasingly wide variety of methodologies being tested and reported via the mainstream media and other channels. The traditional telephone polls of recent decades are now joined by increasing numbers of high profile, online probability and nonprobability sample surveys, as well as prediction markets, all of which showed similar errors. Pollsters don’t have a clear diagnosis yet for the misfires, and it will likely be some time before we know for sure what happened. There are, however, several possible explanations for the misstep that many in the polling community will be talking about in upcoming weeks.  One likely culprit is what pollsters refer to as nonresponse bias. This occurs when certain kinds of people systematically do not respond to surveys despite equal opportunity outreach to all parts of the electorate. We know that some groups – including the less educated voters who were a key demographic for Trump on Election Day – are consistently hard for pollsters to reach. It is possible that the frustration and anti-institutional feelings that drove the Trump campaign may also have aligned with an unwillingness to respond to polls. The result would be a strongly pro-Trump segment of the population that simply did not show up in the polls in proportion to their actual share of the population. Some have also suggested that many of those who were polled simply were not honest about whom they intended to vote for. The idea of so-called “shy Trumpers” suggests that support for Trump was socially undesirable, and that his supporters were unwilling to admit their support to pollsters. This hypothesis is reminiscent of the supposed “Bradley effect,” when Democrat Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, lost the 1982 California gubernatorial election to Republican George Deukmejian despite having been ahead in the polls, supposedly because voters were reluctant to tell interviewers that they were not going to vote for a black candidate. The “shy Trumper” hypothesis has received a fair amount of attention this year. If this were the case, we would expect to see Trump perform systematically better in online surveys, as research has found that people are less likely to report socially undesirable behavior when they are talking to a live interviewer. Politico and Morning Consult conducted an experiment to see if this was the case, and found that overall, there was little indication of an effect, though they did find some suggestion that college-educated and higher-income voters might have been more likely to support Trump online. A third possibility involves the way pollsters identify likely voters. Because we can’t know in advance who is actually going to vote, pollsters develop models predicting who is going to vote and what the electorate will look like on Election Day. This is a notoriously difficult task, and small differences in assumptions can produce sizable differences in election predictions. We may find that the voters that pollsters were expecting, particularly in the Midwestern and Rust Belt states that so defied expectations, were not the ones that showed up. Because many traditional likely-voter models incorporate measures of enthusiasm into their calculus, 2016’s distinctly unenthused electorate – at least on the Democratic side – may have also wreaked some havoc with this aspect of measurement. When the polls failed to accurately predict the British general election in May 2015, it took a blue ribbon panel and more than six months of work before the public had the results of a data-driven, independent inquiry in hand. It may take a similar amount of time to get to the bottom of this election as well. The survey industry’s leading standards association, the American Association for Public Opinion Research, already has an ad hoc committee in place to study the election and report back in May (Pew Research Center’s Director of Survey Research Courtney Kennedy is chairing the committee). Pollsters are well aware that the profession faces serious challenges that this election has only served to highlight. But this is also a time of extensive experimentation and innovation in the field. The role of polling in a democracy goes far beyond simply predicting the horse race. At its best, polling provides an equal voice to everyone and helps to give expression to the public’s needs and wants in ways that elections may be too blunt to do. That is why restoring polling’s credibility is so important, and why we are committed to helping in the effort to do so.

---split---12.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-russia-sancations-bill---split---President Donald Trump plans to sign a bill slapping sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Despite posturing otherwise this week, President Trump will sign a bill that passed overwhelmingly in both chambers slapping new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, the White House announced Friday night. “President Donald J. Trump read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it,” according to a statement issued by the office of Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. “He has now reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it.” The announcement ended several days of drama during which some of the president’s closest aides suggested he might veto the legislation. It also came mere hours after he fired White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and replaced him with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general. Trump’s decision to slap stiffer penalties on Moscow also comes amid a scandal over whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Vladimir Putin’s government. Trump has seemed reluctant to enact such sanctions, but appears to have bowed to domestic political pressures, mostly from his own party. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said multiple times this week that the Trump administration was “nonexistent” as lawmakers sought a final deal on the sanctions bill. On Thursday, incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said Trump might veto a House-passed measure that would slap new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea so he can “negotiate” tougher penalties against Moscow, says In an unscheduled and combative phone call to CNN’s “New Day” morning show, Scaramucci said, after a separate 15-minute talk with Trump, the president had not ruled out rejecting a bill that got 419 Republican and Democratic votes in the House and 98 bipartisan votes in the Senate. Scaramucci on Thursday morning said Trump, at that time, was considering vetoing the sanctions so he could be tougher on the Russians than the Congress via his own sanctions. “He may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians,” the flamboyant former Wall Street financier said. But after the Senate vote, Trump faced an overwhelming veto-proof majority in both chambers, composed largely of members of his own party. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chuckled Thursday when asked if he thought Trump would veto the measure. He told Roll Call that during multiple recent conversations with Trump, the president gave him no indication a veto was afoot.

AP President Donald Trump supported Ron DeSantis, who won Florida's governorship. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) The 2018 midterm election in Florida left Republicans (mostly) triumphant and Democrats (largely) reeling. Republicans will occupy the three most prominent statewide positions, governor and both U.S. Senate seats, while Democrats have been left wondering how they lost races polls had them favored to win. Now the focus shifts to 2020. Can the GOP maintain its momentum in the nation's most important presidential swing state? Can Democrats regroup by building on some beneath-the-radar wins that could bear fruit two years from now? Republican Ron DeSantis scored a win over Democrat Andrew Gillum for governor, and Republican Rick Scott unseated three-term Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson – two crucial victories for President Donald Trump as he prepares for his re-election fight in a state he narrowly captured two years ago over Hillary Clinton. "There are silver linings and warning signs for both parties" looking ahead to 2020, said Susan MacManus, retired political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa. For Democrats, the demographics of a more diverse and younger electorate are "working their way" in favor of a bluer state, she said. For Republicans, the just-completed midterm elections showed how their effective turnout strategy could work again two years from now, she said. The six counties with turnout above 70 percent – Baker, Collier, Franklin, Jefferson, St. Johns and Sumter – went for DeSantis over Gillum and Scott over Nelson. Although the political landscape looks overcast for Sunshine State Democrats, the picture isn't entirely bleak for them. And even though Republicans may have to work even harder for a Trump re-election in two years, they have the advantage of a solid structure in place and a candidate who ignites their base. Much will depend on who wins the Democratic nomination for president. There are plenty of tea leaves for both parties to read today. Here's why Democrats might bounce back in 2020: •Though they lost high-profile races, they made gains at the grass-roots level. Democrats picked up one of the four state offices on the ballot when Nikki Fried won the race to be agriculture commissioner. That may sound like a minor post, but it's the first time a Democrat captured a state Cabinet post since Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink won in 2006. More: Here's why the midterm elections were both good and bad for Donald Trump's re-election More: 'This was not just about an election cycle': Andrew Gillum concedes in Florida governor's race In what may be a more telling picture of the state trending blue, Democrats gained seats in the state Legislature and in the congressional delegation, flipping seats in battleground areas such as Miami-Dade County. At the start of this decade, 19 of the 25 members of Congress representing Florida were Republicans. Come January, 13 of the 27 will be Democrats. •Better-then-normal turnout could portend trouble for Republicans in 2020. Democrats traditionally struggle to turn out their voters in Florida and around the country. But they did a decent job of generating voter enthusiasm this year. Exit polls suggest minorities and young voters are energized over issues such as gun violence, immigration and health care. For example, young voters made up about 6.8 percent of early and absentee voting in Florida. In 2014, they made up about 4.8 percent. The share of early voters 65 and older fell to 44.6 percent, down from 47.8 percent in 2014. Hispanics favored Gillum and Nelson over their Republican opponents, and the Democrats each got about 54 percent of the vote, according to exit polls. Trump's hard-line immigration stance has alienated many Hispanic voters, and that could be a problem for him in Florida in 2020. President Donald Trump tours a neighborhood damaged in Hurricane Maria Oct. 3, 2017, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled their home island after Hurricane Maria sat out November's election, according to registration trends. But there is plenty of time for Puerto Rican voters who located to Florida to register, MacManus said. Trump infuriated many Puerto Ricans when he blamed officials on the island for the slow federal response to Maria and questioned the death toll. •State voters approved a change that should grow the pool of Florida Democrats. The passage of an amendment to the State Constitution on Nov. 6 will give about 1.4 million nonviolent felons who have completed their sentences the right to vote. Minorities comprise a disproportionately high portion of the prison population, so that's likely to expand the potential pool of Democratic-leaning voters. It's not clear how many will actually register to vote. Even a fraction could make a difference in a state known for razor-thin margins. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of more than 9.5 million cast, or 1.2 percent. Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, said he expects they will make an impact in the 2020 election. “There’s a strong likelihood that the landscape in the state of Florida will change based on candidates truly appealing to the needs and interest of that constituency," he said. Republicans have their own reasons for optimism: •Continued control of the Governor's Mansion (and the Legislature) and now both Senate seats means Republicans will enable the party to promote an agenda that dovetails with Trump's policies. Andrew Gillum concedes to Ron DeSantis in Florida's gubernatorial race. (Photo: WTSP) Having the governor in the state be from the same party is a “really, really big help” for a presidential candidate, because governors have powerful statewide organizations, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Even though the U.S. House is in Democratic control, Republicans have a role to play, said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Panhandle congressman who is among the president's most ardent supporters. "We need to defend an administration that's going to be under constant attack," he said. "If the Democrats are able to go up and down the court, scoring uncontested layups, it becomes very difficult for the president. I intend to play a lot of tough defense." •Turnout was high among Democrats but also solid for Republicans. Florida saw its highest overall voter turnout rate since 1994, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Unofficial voting numbers show the state had a 62 percent turnout rate, compared with a 51 percent turnout rate in 2014 and 49 percent in 2010. "In a year where we saw states like Arizona and Michigan showed a slightly bluer hue, Florida Republicans continued to demonstrate turnout potential that's really good news for the president," Gaetz said. "The reddest parts of Florida were turning out at a rate of 75 percent and up. It shows that the Trump fire is burning bright red among his coalition." •Florida has a habit of backing presidential re-elections. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt's first re-election bid in 1936, sitting presidents have won all but two of their re-election contests: Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump considers the state a second home, given the presence of his Mar-a-Lago Estate in Palm Beach that he dubbed "the Winter White House." That should mean plenty of face time with Florida voters. •Florida Republicans generally run a better turnout model. Democrats are known for attracting third-party groups into the state to lead voter registration efforts a few months before an election. That can lead to a lot of sign-ups but not always turnout. Democrats had more than 4.9 million voters as of Sept. 30, compared with nearly 4.7 million Republican voters, state records show. (That gap has shrunk in recent years as GOP affiliation has risen). "Republicans are year-round, neighbor-to-neighbor, more grass roots up than top down like the Democrats," MacManus said. Contributing: Deborah Barfield Berry and Maureen Groppe  
---split---12.0---split---https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-democrats-midterms-election_us_5bf2dba7e4b0b84243e4ae2d---split---WASHINGTON ― Democrats didn’t simply win in places they expected to on Nov. 6. They also managed to flip districts Donald Trump won easily in the 2016 presidential election, as well as some districts that have been held by Republicans for decades. The secret to their success was a fairly conventional, but somewhat surprising, campaign strategy during an election year that was mostly seen as a referendum on Trump: Talking about anything but the president. Democrat Kendra Horn, for example, pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the night when she defeated two-term incumbent Steve Russell in Oklahoma’s 5th Congressional District, a seat held by Republicans since 1975. Horn is the first Democratic woman to be elected to Congress from Oklahoma. Moreover, she’s the third woman ever to be elected to Congress in the state’s history. Her largely urban district went to Trump by almost 14 percentage points, prompting skepticism among national pollsters that it would be one of the seats that would flip this year. “I think many people thought I might have lost my mind,” Horn recalled last week at a post-election debrief in Washington, where she reflected on the moment she chose to run for office. “I just believed in the power of talking to the community and saw there was a pathway there. I figured, if not me, who? If not now, when?” Horn campaigned on left-wing issues like gun control, stricter campaign finance regulations, opposition to private prisons, and more funding for education ― an issue that especially resonated with voters after an unprecedented strike by Oklahoma teachers this year. The GOP-controlled state slashed public school funding significantly since the Great Recession, while also pursuing tax cuts that have benefited businesses and the wealthy. The budget shortfalls left no money to pump into schools or salaries, leading to teacher shortages, overcrowded classrooms and even four-day school weeks. “What we were hearing about was not the president, it was about education, it was about health care,” Horn said at the event, organized by political data firm TargetSmart. “We had a massive teacher walkout in the spring, so education loomed particularly large. ... That really, really kept us out of that national narrative. If we were trying to follow that, it was like this ping pong, and that’s not what people, when you got down to it, are concerned about.” Horn resisted attempts by Russell to turn the race into a debate on national issues, avoiding direct criticism of Trump and associations with House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). It was a critical calculation in a state the president won more than 36 points in the last election. Focusing on the eye-catching headlines coming out of Washington, she explained, ”would have been a no-win space” for her campaign. Winning over traditionally conservative voters also helped moderate Democrat Jeff Van Drew defeat a right-wing Republican in New Jersey’s 2nd District. The coastal South Jersey seat went up for grabs this year after GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo decided to retire after 24 years in office. Its residents voted for President Barack Obama twice before swinging to Trump in the 2016 election. Granted, Van Drew was fortunate enough to have an extremely flawed opponent in Seth Grossman, who was abandoned by his national Republicans because of his bigoted statements about minorities and diversity. But Van Drew, a dentist and a state senator, didn’t take the race for granted. He honed his pitch to Republican voters who liked Trump, but not some of his policies like offshore drilling. “I think the big trick in a red district is to prove to folks you are running against a particularly bad Republican,” Van Drew said. “So that they can feel like, ‘Oh I’m still Republican, but this one I’m not voting for.’” Figuring out how best to approach wary Trump supporters wasn’t always easy. Van Drew recalled meeting a married couple at a county fair who disagreed on how best to deal with Trump. While the husband seemed more apprehensive about Van Drew’s answer on standing up to the president when the situation called for it, the wife urged him to “knock [Trump] down and go after him ― whatever you can do, go after him.” The most challenging aspect of the election for Van Drew, however, may have been overcoming deep-seated partisanship among the electorate. With talk of a blue wave before November, losing control of the House weighed heavily in the minds of many Republican voters who otherwise may have been more open to voting for a Democrat. “So many people came up to me and said, ‘I really like you I want to vote for you, I do think we need some change but, quite frankly, I don’t want to flip the House. I’m a Republican, I don’t want to flip the House. I think it’s dangerous,’” Van Drew recalled. “That’s a hard argument to have. ... That made it certainly more challenging.” Democrats dealt with the problem by having their candidates use more amorphous code words, like “dysfunction,” and “chaos,” to call for change in Washington, instead of attacking the president directly. It’s a messaging strategy that is ironically similar to the anti-establishment “Drain the swamp” rallying cry that Trump and his campaign used in the 2016 election, one his administration has failed to deliver. “It’s not just President Trump, it’s the Washington system right now. It’s about changing everything,” said Kerry Gooch, the campaign manager for Democrat Paul Davis, who narrowly lost a Kansas congressional seat that Trump carried by 18 points. “Our whole campaign was about inspiring people, about giving people something to hope for. We tried as much as possible not to talk about what was going on in Washington, but instead, change the conversation to what we can do together.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

---split---13.0---split---https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-reason-hear-khashoggi-death-tape-59286440---split---President Donald Trump said there is no reason for him to listen to a recording of the "very violent, very vicious" killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has put him in a diplomatic bind: how to admonish Riyadh for the slaying yet maintain strong ties with a close ally. Trump, in an interview that aired Sunday, made clear that the audio recording, supplied by the Turkish government, would not affect his response to the Oct. 2 killing of Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who had been critical of the Saudi royal family. "It's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it, there's no reason for me to hear it," Trump said in the interview with "Fox News Sunday." ''I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it." On Saturday, Trump said his administration will "be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday." He said the report will include "who did it." It was unclear if the report would be made public. American intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Others familiar with the case caution that while it's likely the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played. Trump noted to "Fox News Sunday" that the crown prince has repeatedly denied being involved in the killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. "Will anybody really know?" Trump asked. "At the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good." A Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee said that so far, there is no "smoking gun" linking the crown prince to the killing. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who has received a confidential intelligence briefing on the matter, told ABC that "it's hard to imagine" that the crown prince didn't know about the killing, but he said, "I don't know that we absolutely know that yet." He said that Congress will await the Trump administration's report in the next two days and that the U.S. will need to be clear about the ramifications of sanctions, given Saudi Arabia's strategic role in the Middle East. For his part, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said the crown prince has been a "wrecking ball" in the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. "I hate to say that because I had a lot of hope for him being the reformer that Saudi Arabia needs, but that ship has sailed as far as Lindsey Graham's concerned," the South Carolina Republican told NBC's "Meet the Press." "I have no intention of working with him ever again," said Graham, who is in line to be the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Intelligence officials have been providing information to Trump for weeks about the death, and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA. "The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable," the State Department said in a statement. "Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi." The statement added: "The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia." Before his call on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, "as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say." That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince. Germany's foreign minister on Monday said Berlin had banned 18 Saudi nationals from entering Europe's border-free Schengen zone because they are believed to be connected to Khashoggi's killing. Heiko Maas told reporters in Brussels on Monday that Germany issued the ban for the 26-nation zone in close coordination with France, which is part of the Schengen area, and Britain, which is not. He said the 18 Saudis are "allegedly connected to this crime" but gave no further information and didn't release their names. Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said "the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups." But he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda. But members of Congress are pushing Trump for a tougher response to the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures. Turkish and Saudi authorities say Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.
---split---13.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/good-bye-midterm-dynamic-hello-presidential-politics---split---President Donald Trump made the midterms about him, but that dynamic is likely to change in some proportion for 2020, Rothenberg writes. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call file photo) Midterm elections and presidential cycles have such different dynamics that the two should almost never be discussed together. That will not prevent people from doing so, but they should resist the temptation. Midterms tend to be referendums on the incumbent president, while each presidential election is a choice between nominees. Of course, a presidential re-election contest is something of a referendum on the incumbent, since sitting officeholders seeking another term will be evaluated on the basis of their performance in addition to what they promise for the future. Also Watch: Now That That’s Over (Mostly) Roll Call Looks Ahead to 2020 But the existence of an alternative on the ballot makes a presidential year very different from a midterm year. That’s why connecting the dots from the last midterm election to the next presidential contest is so unwise. Initially, Democrat Michael Dukakis looked like the clear favorite in 1988 as the candidate of change after eight years of Ronald Reagan. But Vice President George H.W. Bush redefined the technocratic Massachusetts governor as weak on crime, too liberal and personally weak (whether riding in a tank or responding to a hypothetical debate question about his wife). Bush won by transforming the 1988 election from a referendum on the previous eight years to a choice between the two nominees and parties. Twenty years later, again without an incumbent on the ballot, Democrat Barack Obama offered his vision for the future but also successfully portrayed Republican John McCain as offering a third term of George W. Bush — an option that most Americans found unappealing. And of course, in the most recent presidential contest, the politically inexperienced Donald Trump won by driving up former Secretary of State and Sen. Hillary Clinton’s negatives and making her unacceptable to an important part of the electorate. In presidential years, voters cast separate ballots for president and for Congress. During midterms, those same voters don’t have a presidential ballot, so they don’t have a direct way to express their dissatisfaction with the person in the Oval Office apart from voting against the nominees of the president’s party. How does all this relate to 2018 and 2020? Last week’s midterm election was primarily about Trump. Red state voters, enthusiastic about the president’s performance and wanting to elect a more “Trumpy” Congress, supported Republican nominees. Those voters were making a partisan and ideological statement. Blue state voters also wanted to make a statement about the Trump/Republican agenda and about the president’s character and behavior. With Trump not on the ballot — but traveling around the country saying that he was in fact on the ballot — the only way to send a signal of dissatisfaction to the White House and to make a statement about changing the direction of the country was to vote against Republicans for federal office. That is exactly what swing voters (including independents and college-educated whites) and core Democratic demographic groups did. Democrats of various stripes had no difficulty agreeing that Trump needed to be stopped and that consensus produced both a huge anti-Trump turnout and a surge of votes against Republican officeholders. Trump, who in rally after rally sounded partisan and ideological, united Democrats and energized them, turning them out to vote for Democratic House nominees. But two years from now, there will be a fundamentally different dynamic. Democrats will spend more than a year fighting among themselves about their party’s presidential nomination. (If you have any doubt about that, just remember that on election night some in the party were already arguing about their leader in the House of Representatives.) Progressive and pragmatist/establishment Democrats will demonize each other during debates and campaign stops, making it more difficult for the party to rally behind the eventual nominee. That fight will give Trump many opportunities to belittle his adversaries, play up Democratic divisions and remind Republicans, independents and college-educated white women why they didn’t vote Democratic in 2016. Trump and his GOP allies tried to make the 2018 midterms about Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Democratic funder George Soros, the economy and the “fake” media. But they were unable to so — they never really had much of a chance — because the president is such a dominant political figure. But in 2020, the Democratic ticket could make Trump look better to some swing voters who sent a message of dissatisfaction this year but might find someone like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Attorney General Eric Holder unacceptable alternatives. It’s tempting to draw lessons about 2020 by looking at 2018, just as it is tempting to pronounce at this early date which states will determine the next presidential election. Don’t do either one just yet. There are too many uncertainties. Give the new cycle some time to unfold. Watch the economy. Watch President Trump. Watch the tone of the Democrats. Wait to see how domestic and international events change public opinion. And most important, take a break to collect your thoughts and to regain some sanity. It’s still 2018, after all.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) ANALYSIS | President Donald Trump got around Thursday to commemorating Veterans Day on American soil, four days after the actual holiday and after as many days holed up in and lashing out from the White House. Trump did speak Sunday at a rain-soaked Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in France, where U.S. soldiers who died in World War I are buried, and he visited graves there. But he canceled a Saturday visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial because of bad weather, later blaming the Secret Service. He arrived back at the White House Sunday night, too late for any official Veterans Day events. But this Thursday, it was Veterans Day at the White House — four days after the holiday and three after the official observance day. The president, joined by first lady Melania Trump, visited a Marine Corps barracks near Capitol Hill, where he chatted with rank-and-file Marines and then their leadership. [Despite Evidence of Chaos, Trump Says White House ‘Running Very Smoothly’] After a quick motorcade ride back to the executive mansion through an autumn snow and ice storm, the president delivered remarks on helping the country’s veterans. But, as has become customary in this White House, the event featured some awkward and memorable moments. Here are a few highlights. Other than the timing itself — which felt like a mulligan after the president was criticized for not at least going to Arlington National Cemetery on Monday — Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie offered the first odd moments. His predecessor, David Shulkin, was fired. As the drama surrounding Trump’s first nominee to replace Shulkin, White House doctor and Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson played out, Wilkie was the department’s acting boss. Whether he intended to or not, Wilkie, in just a few words Thursday, cast doubt on the ability of any acting agency secretary to have any sway inside their departments. “Now for those of you who have had your heads beaten in by the Jesuit fathers, as I have had, being the acting secretary is like being in Jesuit limbo. You are, but you’re not,” Wilkie quipped. Leaving aside the awkward comment about a Catholic church, with that attendant baggage, Wilkie might have just made life even harder for acting secretaries — including acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and any others Trump might create if he carries out a post-midterms purge of his Cabinet. Candidate Trump talked about the dismal state of veterans’ care a lot on the campaign trail. In fact, during his remarks Thursday, the president said he couldn’t recall a single 2016 speech in which he failed to mention veterans. Wilkie, however, remembers things differently. “There’s never been a presidential campaign … where one of the candidates made [military] veterans the centerpiece of his campaign,” he said. In contrast, his boss said a few minutes later that veterans’ issues were “a very major part,” but not the main plank. Somehow, the VA secretary managed to out-Trump Trump, a man known to embellish. As usual, Trump’s remarks featured the usual ticking off of some accomplishments since he took office. He dropped in his belief that the country has “the greatest economy we have had in many, many years. … It’s booming.” [Pelosi Claims She Would be Speaker if Contest Held Today] Soon it was onto a veterans’ bill he signed into law and some statistics he says show he is the most pro-vets president in American history. In fact, Trump suggested — jokingly — maybe he could move onto other matters. “Goodbye, everybody,” he said with a wave as he took a step away from his podium. “I figured I did so much I could leave now.” He stayed, saying his administration would never stop working on behalf of veterans. Trump managed to shoehorn in a mention of his favorite new U.S. fighter jet, the Lockheed Martin-made F-35. He talked about it a lot on the midterms campaign trail. “They’re stealth. You can’t see it,” he said Thursday. Of course, the fighter isn’t actually invisible, like Wonder Woman’s plane. It’s just designed to evade radar. The Pentagon certainly sees it, and its long list of technical snafus and an ever-swelling price tag before it can be deployed on a wide scale.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. After retired Admiral McRaven said Trump's attacks on the media were 'greatest threat to democracy,' President Trump dismissed the retired 4-star admiral and his work on the raid that killed Usama bin Laden; Garrett Tenney reports. The Republican National Committee on Monday backed comments by President Trump that were critical of retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, best known for overseeing the Navy SEAL operation that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden. In a Twitter post from its official @GOP account, the RNC noted that McRaven "was reportedly on Hillary Clinton’s short list for Vice President in 2016." "He’s been critical of President @realDonaldTrump— even dating back to the 2016 campaign," the tweet added. "He’s hardly a non-political figure." Trump referred to McRaven as a "Hillary Clinton fan" and an "Obama backer" during an exclusive interview with "Fox News Sunday." He then segued into criticism of McRaven for not finding bin Laden sooner. "Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Usama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn’t it have been nice?” Trump asked host Chris Wallace. " ... Living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there." McRaven, who retired from the Navy in 2014 after 37 years of service, was the head of Joint Special Operations Command when bin Laden was killed in May 2011. McRaven has repeatedly criticized Trump over the president's description of journalists as "the enemy of the American people," writing in February 2017 that those comments represented "perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime." William McRaven retired from the Navy in 2014 after a 37-year career. (Reuters) In a statement to CNN on Sunday, McRaven stood by his criticism of the president. "When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression, then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands," said McRaven, who also noted that he "did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else" in the 2016 election. "I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all Presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the Nation together in challenging times." Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell criticized Trump's remarks about McRaven on Twitter Sunday, writing "Correction needed to [Trump's] comment today that McRaven should have found bin Laden sooner. CIA did the 'finding.' McRaven’s special operators did the 'getting.' They moved within days of President Obama giving the order." Robert O'Neill, who fired the shot that killed bin Laden in 2011, wrote Sunday that McRaven "was born to lead this mission. I'll follow him anywhere. If only people heard the real speech he gave the Team ..." On Monday, O'Neill added: "The mission to get bin Laden was bipartisan. We all wanted to get him as soon as we could." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has his own fraught relationship with Trump, tweeted: "I don’t know if Adm. William McRaven shares my political views or not. But I do know that few Americans have sacrificed or risked more than he has to protect America & the freedoms we enjoy. His military career exemplified honor & excellence. I am grateful for his service." Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the nephew of former President George W. Bush, wrote: "Having served in Afghanistan with Adm. McRaven, I have personally witnessed his patriotism & love of country. He is an American hero & has always served our country with honor. I’m grateful for his service and sacrifices for our freedom." McRaven also criticized Trump earlier this year when the president revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance. In a letter published by The Washington Post, McRaven wrote that "I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency." "Through your actions," McRaven added, "you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation." Trump returned to the subject of the bin Laden raid in a tweet Monday morning but did not name McRaven specifically. "Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did," Trump said. "I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!."

---split---14.0---split---https://www.wired.com/story/internet-week-196/---split---In all kinds of ways, the past seven days feel like the second part of a two-episode storyline that started last week, and not just because California is still on fire and we’re still getting midterm election results (for those curious, it’s only gotten worse for Republicans, no matter how desperate they get). Indeed, a lot of what people were talking about last week—Melania Trump's verion of "you're fired" and pro wrestling debacles aside—were events set in motion at various points in the past. But perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that this week ended up being far less original than it might otherwise have been. It did, after all, start with the sad death of Marvel co-creator Stan Lee; you can’t blame the universe’s creativity for being a little low after that, can you? What Happened: At the time of year when it’s expected that the President of the United States would honor America’s fallen soldiers, Donald Trump managed to shun them not once, but twice in a single week. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media reports What Really Happened: The week started with President Trump in Europe, having decamped to France for the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. It wasn’t that he was running away from his many troubles in the US, it was that he was running toward commemorating all the American soldiers who died in Europe during the Great War. There was just one problem with that: He ended up skipping a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery on Saturday, with the cancellation officially blamed on “scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather.” https://twitter.com/FHeisbourg/status/1061268124899729408 https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/1061487951111168000 https://twitter.com/ClaraJeffery/status/1061364708920320000 He did, at least, show up for a second cemetery visit a day later (but only after being pals with Vladimir Putin, because of course). At least that didn’t backfire, right? https://twitter.com/WestWingReport/status/1061648075578576902 https://twitter.com/stevennelson10/status/1061639491113365509 https://twitter.com/lizziedearden/status/1061639791069007873 He returned to the US that day, in time to be observe Veterans Day in Washington, meaning he can uphold that proud tradition of visiting Arlington National Cemetery. Because, surely, after what happened in France, he’d not skip that for any reason. (You know what’s coming next.) https://twitter.com/MrFilmkritik/status/1062018694128242688 Oh yes, that happened. https://twitter.com/MikeyKayNYC/status/1062129466556801025 https://twitter.com/repblumenauer/status/1062169154533408768 Well, if he wasn’t going to Arlington National Cemetery, what was he doing? https://twitter.com/igorvolsky/status/1062024126943113216 https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1062030843881947136 Don’t worry; the upset over Trump skipping Arlington didn’t mean that everyone had forgotten about France, because he himself brought it up on Twitter later in the week: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1062371844836261891 Sure, it seems silly that he might have been legitimately afraid of rain, but it’s not out of the realm of possibility. Just ask stairs. The Takeaway: Of course, the real reason for Trump’s absence in France was far less interesting, and—like most true horror—infinitely more mundane: https://twitter.com/ErickFernandez/status/1062884472884994048 What Happened: In the face of an attack on the First Amendment by the United States Government, CNN did something unexpected: It took the matter to the courts, suing the White House for shutting out reporter Jim Acosta. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media reports What Really Happened: Perhaps you remember last week, when the White House decided to pull CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s pass for reasons that were immediately contradicted by anyone with access to un-doctored video. This week, there was a surprise when CNN went surprisingly hard in response: https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1062349001285079040 https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1062350626389020673 https://twitter.com/ErikWemple/status/1062365023014662145 The lawsuit was, as should only be expected, a huge media story, perhaps, because who cares about free speech more than journalists? The White House was quick to respond: https://twitter.com/finnygo/status/1062370453182910464 While the administration didn't love CNN’s lawsuit, other organizations were much more supportive: https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1062735841926283265 https://twitter.com/grynbaum/status/1062743892435632129 https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1062763151115063298 And as it turned out, the White House wasn’t content to let Sarah Huckabee Sanders handle the official response alone: https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1062754556503883776 https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/1062738881693523968 https://twitter.com/MarshallCohen/status/1062758551733657600 On Wednesday, the matter was argued in court: https://twitter.com/JasonSchwartz/status/1062797665656860672 https://twitter.com/ErikWemple/status/1062829007635468293 https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/1062832597133213697 Initially, a decision was announced for Thursday, but that was later postponed until the following day. Did things go the Administration’s way? They did not. https://twitter.com/pdmcleod/status/1063452596470538240 https://twitter.com/SchneiderCNN/status/1063453789724831746 https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1063458045164961793 The Takeaway: More partisan outlets were quick to jump to the administration's defense. Not only did fringe network One America News Network file a brief supporting the White House, but at least one pundit thought this was the best opportunity to own the libs just a little bit more: https://twitter.com/MarkDice/status/1063273834516668417 What Happened: Post-midterms, everyone suddenly remembers that the President of the United States is under a special counsel investigation. And when we say “everyone,” we mean the President of the United States. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media reports What Really Happened: This week has been a fascinating one for those who remember the fact that an ongoing investigation is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power to get him elected back in 2016. For one thing, people started to notice some strange social-media patterns: https://twitter.com/martinwalsh/status/1062204473072701440 (For what it’s worth, the National Enquirer also went temporarily silent on Twitter between November 9 and 13. Conspiracy theorists, start conspiring. It should also be noted that WikiLeaks might have an additional reason for being silent if reports are to be believed.) Oh, and then there was a rash of reports—prompted by an associate of Roger Stone—that Robert Mueller was preparing to issue new indictments, potentially including Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr.. Against this background, it’s not the greatest surprise that many are fearful for the longterm prospects of the investigation, especially considering that the President essentitally admitted that incoming acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker got the job because he’ll be able to kill the probe. https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1063067122019065856 With all this happening, some tried to create legislation to protect Mueller. Any guesses as to how that went? https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1062816556521046017 https://twitter.com/MikeDelMoro/status/1062818058337689600 https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1062838011820498946 https://twitter.com/LauraLitvan/status/1063149103134183426 Thursday morning, the President did his best impression of someone who almost certainly has nothing to hide and certainly isn’t guilty of anything suspicious that could be uncovered by the Special Counsel investigation on Twitter: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1063042585802039296 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1063046973857718272 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1063081553075625984 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1063084073231544320 It’s worth noting that the rant came not only after Trump had installed Whitaker as acting AG, but also after the President had met with his lawyers to respond to written questions from Mueller. Not that there's, uh, any connection between the two. And then there's the question of the actual contents of the rant: https://twitter.com/jonkarl/status/1063049123346214912 https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1063043095732912128 https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/1063074419571150848 https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1063087400472207361 The Takeaway: Still, it’s not like the President’s lawyer is making public statements suggesting that the President can’t answer questions without getting in trouble with the law, right? https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1063189614427602944 What Happened: After months of speculation, Amazon finally announced the location—sorry, locations—of its new headquarters. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media reports What Really Happened: The long national nightmare that was mystery over where the next Amazon headquarters would be based is finally over! Sorry, New York and Northern Virginia: https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1062201696393277441 Two headquarters for the price of one! (And what a price, but we’ll get there soon enough…) https://twitter.com/tictoc/status/1062358483889283072 And while it wasn’t a full-on headquarters, Nashville got a piece of the action as well. https://twitter.com/tictoc/status/1062359921885360130 Not everyone was happy, though. Actually, that’s putting it mildly; because no one seemed happy about this news. Some were more unhappy than others, of course: https://twitter.com/bettinajudd/status/1062292667810439168 https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1062367581875646465 https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/1062204614496403457 I’m sure that the cost to the cities is entirely necessary and not ridiculously ostentatious, right? https://twitter.com/henrygrabar/status/1062378212859228162 https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1062399105031266304 Then again, what company would turn down a taxpayer-funded helipad? But it’s not just New York, though: https://twitter.com/NaomiEide/status/1062381106677407745 Oh, and there’s something else strange about the Virginia location… https://twitter.com/brfreed/status/1062358666337271810 https://twitter.com/vikkie/status/1062358896294137856 Wait, it gets better: https://twitter.com/markberman/status/1062362798343286785 Is … is this innovation? The Takeaway: But amidst all of this, let’s take a moment to think about the cities that didn’t win the chance to host Amazon. I bet they’re heartbroken: https://twitter.com/laura_nelson/status/1062365714042912768 What Happened: Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the looming shadow of Brexit has gotten a little bit sharper this week, thus making the political future of the woman in charge of the entire country look far more uncertain. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media reports What Really Happened: Remember Brexit? That whole “Britain voted to leave the European Union, which was a terrible decision, but the people who regretted it weren’t in charge, and now it’s just months away and no one knows how it's going to actually work” thing? Everyone was waiting for the United Kingdom to make a deal with the European Union that was, somehow, agreeable to both parties—something that was beginning to seem impossible, given that it hadn’t happened in the two years since the original vote. And then, this week, a deal finally appeared to be made. A deal that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May certainly stood behind firmly and strongly: https://twitter.com/christopherhope/status/1062787890558763010 Ah, the old “It’s not good, but it’s the best I could do.” Maybe the full statement is a bit more hopeful. https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1062790717716774912 Or, y'know, maybe not. The opposition parties certainly didn't seem willing to give her the benefit of the doubt: https://twitter.com/PeterAdamSmith/status/1062801122967085056 https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1062706734207254529 https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1061356393691779072 For her part, May was a touch less than convincing when arguing her case in Parliament: https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1063020571590504449 Indeed, she fared so poorly that one of her own MPs threw her under the bus in an impressively public fashion: https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1063030974395703297 That’s Jacob Rees Mogg, who went from wound up filing a motion of no confidence in his party’s leadership as a result. But maybe Rees Mogg—and yes, we all think he sounds like a Star Wars Imperial officer too—was an outlier, and not everyone in May’s Conservative party is so desperately unhappy... https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1062992019449098241 https://twitter.com/Aiannucci/status/1063007128645001216 Okay, so the Brexit Secretary quitting in protest is not a good sign. But the resignations had only just begun. https://twitter.com/EstherMcVey1/status/1063008263225126912 https://twitter.com/TeamRanil/status/1063047836055560193 https://twitter.com/Rehman_Chishti/status/1063083736164720640 https://twitter.com/easypoliticsUK/status/1063078298627043328 https://twitter.com/bbcquestiontime/status/1063209929165684736 Well at least this is purely political and doesn't have any real-world implications... https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes/status/1063220136256159744 The Takeaway: Of course, the national mood in the United Kingdom continued to express that stiff upper lip that the union of nations is known for. https://twitter.com/frankieboyle/status/1063051982955573248 Many fake news peddlers didn’t care if Trump won or lost the election.

---split---14.0---split---http://www.pewresearch.org/essay/from-maga-to-metoo-a-look-at-u-s-public-opinion-in-2017/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  December 20, 2017 In his first year as U.S. president, Donald Trump represented a clear break in style and substance from his predecessor, Barack Obama – and from many of the chief executives who came before them. The businessman-turned-politician upended Washington with unrestrained rhetoric and an “America First” agenda that included renegotiating international trade pacts, withdrawing from a worldwide climate change agreement and curtailing immigration into the United States. At home and abroad, the public reacted strongly to the White House’s new occupant and his policies. Confidence in the U.S. president plummeted in many countries, particularly in Western Europe, while opinions of America itself also declined sharply. In the U.S., already-wide partisan gaps on fundamental political values grew even wider. A fraught relationship between Trump and the press drew frequent attention, with large majorities seeing it as unhealthy and an impediment to Americans’ ability to access important political news. And, as the country began to adjust to this new era, substantial shares in both parties – particularly women – said they were paying more attention to politics since Trump’s election. Democrats were overwhelmingly negative in their assessments of Trump, who came to office vowing to undo Obama-era policies from the 2010 health care overhaul to environmental regulations to a program that shielded nearly 800,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation. Republicans were buoyed by the arrival of the first GOP president in eight years and cheered his successful nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. While some GOP members of Congress found themselves at odds with an unconventional and outspoken chief executive of their own party, Republicans appeared poised to achieve a major legislative victory at year’s end by overhauling the federal tax code. Trump’s contentious first year was among the defining stories of 2017. But beyond the shifts in policy and approach that accompanied the transition between presidential administrations, the year revealed other important trends shaping American society. Allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful men in entertainment, media and politics – from Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein to morning news anchor Matt Lauer to the longest-serving member of Congress, John Conyers – brought widespread attention to the issues of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and gender equality. The #MeToo campaign, which spread rapidly on Twitter and Facebook in the wake of these news stories, prompted women around the country to share stories about their personal experiences with sexual misconduct. And, when Time magazine selected its “Person of the Year” in December, the winner was not one person but the broad range of people who came forward. Pew Research Center surveys underscored the breadth of these experiences, as well as the public’s attitudes toward them. In a poll conducted in early fall, about four-in-ten U.S. women said they had personally experienced gender discrimination or been treated unfairly because of their gender, while nearly six-in-ten women said the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to giving women equal rights with men. In a separate survey, many employed women reported an array of experiences with gender discrimination at work, ranging from earning less than a man for doing the same job to being treated as if they were not competent. Racial issues continued to draw national attention. The removal of Confederate statues by local governments in the South and elsewhere became a flashpoint as Americans debated whether the statues perpetuated racism or merely reflected a common history. In August, a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to violent clashes in the city’s streets, including the death of one person and the injury of 19 others when a car driven by an alleged white nationalist sped into a crowd of counterprotesters. Discussions of race extended to other venues as well. When the NFL season began in the fall, some players protested perceived racial injustice and police mistreatment of blacks by kneeling during the national anthem, a move that provoked anger among those who saw the protests as disrespectful. Trump was among those who criticized the players; indeed, he was a frequent commenter on the nation’s racial controversies. Against this backdrop, the public expressed rising concern about race relations. In an August survey conducted shortly after the violence in Charlottesville, nearly six-in-ten Americans said they viewed racism as a big problem in U.S. society — up 8 percentage points from 2015 and roughly double the share who held this view in November 2011. But there were stark divisions along racial and partisan lines. For example, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were far more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to see racism as a big problem. A similar trend was evident on a separate question about whether white people in the U.S. benefit from societal advantages that blacks do not have: Democrats and Democratic leaners were much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to say whites do benefit from such advantages. The economy brought positive news. The national unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in October and November, the lowest level since 2000. The Dow Jones industrial average, which broke 20,000 points in January for the first time ever, soared to more than 24,000 points by the end of the year. Americans’ evaluations of the economy also improved: About four-in-ten rated national economic conditions as “excellent” or “good,” the highest share in a decade. As has historically been the case, however, views tended to be colored by the public’s partisan affiliations, with a surge in Republican optimism driving much of the overall increase in economic positivity. Gun violence took an especially deadly toll in 2017. In October, a gunman in a Las Vegas hotel room opened fire on an open-air concert below, killing 58 people and injuring nearly 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s modern history. A month later, a man in rural Texas shot 26 people to death and injured 20 others as they attended a Sunday church service – the worst mass shooting in that state’s history. Earlier in the year, a gunman fired dozens of rounds at members of Congress, their staff members and others participating in a morning baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, severely injuring Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the highest-ranking members of the House of Representatives. The spate of attacks brought familiar calls for legislation to restrict access to guns. A survey the Center conducted in spring, before the shootings, found areas of agreement on some proposals, such as preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns and requiring background checks for private gun sales and those at gun shows. More broadly, however, it shed light on the country’s complex relationship with guns, including some fundamental divides between gun owners and non-gun owners and Democrats and Republicans. While three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic leaners said gun laws should be more strict than they are today, for instance, only about a quarter of Republicans and Republican leaners (24%) agreed. And while most Republicans (56%) said there would be less crime if more Americans owned guns, just 15% of Democrats shared that view. Large partisan gaps were evident across many of the issues the Center asked about in 2017, from Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico to the threat posed by global climate change. One area that starkly divided the parties was the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The inquiry, launched in May, led to criminal charges against four former members of the campaign, including its one-time chairman, Paul Manafort. In a survey fielded in November and December, only about a quarter of Republicans and Republican leaners (26%) said Trump officials definitely or probably had improper contacts with Russia during the campaign. By contrast, about eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (82%) said such contacts definitely or probably occurred. Partisans were also sharply divided over whether Mueller’s investigation would be conducted fairly: While nearly seven-in-ten Democrats (68%) were confident it would be fair, just 44% of Republicans agreed. Trump himself referred to the investigation as a “witch hunt.” In some cases, partisan shifts in opinion were dramatic. Amid Trump’s persistent criticisms of CNN and other media outlets as “fake news,” for example, partisan differences over the role of the press as a “watchdog” were wider than in more than three decades of Pew Research Center surveys. In a March survey, Democrats were roughly twice as likely as Republicans to say criticism from news organizations keeps political leaders from doing things that shouldn’t be done (89% versus 42%). When the Center last asked this question in January and February 2016, about three-quarters of both Democrats (74%) and Republicans (77%) said this. The federal government’s handling of natural disasters also became a charged partisan issue, particularly following Hurricane Maria, which caused widespread damage and loss of life in Puerto Rico. In a survey late in the year, nearly nine-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (88%) said the federal government is doing a good job responding to natural disasters, a view shared by only about half (51%) of Democrats and Democratic leaners. In October 2015, there was only a 4-point gap between the parties on this question, with 82% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans saying the government does a good job handling natural disasters. Not all issues divided the country along partisan lines. Americans across the political spectrum expressed rising worry about North Korea’s nuclear program following a series of increasingly advanced missile tests by the secretive Asian nation and an escalating war of words between Trump and the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Three-quarters of Americans said in October that they view North Korea’s nuclear program as a “major threat” to the U.S., up from 64% in January and as high a share as at any point since 2005. Majorities in both parties said the U.S. should take the North’s threats very seriously; that the North is really willing to follow through on its threats to use nuclear weapons against the U.S.; and that the North is capable of launching a missile that could reach the U.S. An overwhelming majority of Americans also said they believed Trump is “really willing” to use military force against North Korea. In both parties, majorities of Americans also agreed on some other perceived security threats facing the U.S., from cyberattacks launched by other countries to the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, which again claimed high-profile attacks in places including Manchester, England; Barcelona, Spain; and New York City, which suffered its deadliest terrorist attack since Sept. 11, 2001. As 2017 draws to a close, some of the stories that defined the year will continue to unfold. There is little sign, for example, that the crisis in North Korea will disappear; nor do stories about sexual misconduct appear likely to subside, and the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election continues. The Trump administration will push forward on its policy agenda, including decisions about immigration and the border wall. As 2018 arrives, Pew Research Center will be observing these and other important developments – and, as always, seeking to understand Americans’ views about the society they live in.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. CNN wins court order against the Trump administration after the White House revoked the CNN reporter's credentials. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. That age-old advice about the distinction between freedom and wisdom came to mind as I read the ruling that requires the White House to reissue media credentials to CNN blowhard Jim Acosta. Federal Judge Timothy Kelly said Acosta must be allowed to return because there was no due process in the decision to suspend him. Kelly, appointed by President Trump, emphasized he wasn’t ruling on the merits of the suspension or Acosta’s behavior, only the process. “I have not determined that the First Amendment was violated here,” he wrote, adding that the White House has no obligation to call on Acosta for questions. While the outcome is a setback for Trump, it is also sensible and points the way forward. The president responded by saying his team will draw up rulesrequiring “decorum” and standards of behavior, and predicts ultimate victory. Actually, he’s already won something bigger than the case at hand. He’s established the principle that a press pass is not a license to lecture and hector the president while refusing to yield the microphone, all of which Acosta did. The principle is so obvious it shouldn’t need to be clarified, but written rules are necessary because Acosta abused his privilege. Now the details of the rules must be spelled out to cover any future cases. But there won’t be any future cases — if the press corps get its act together. The White House Correspondents’ Association must find the courage to police the bad apples in its ranks instead of waiting for the government to act, then running to the courts for protection. Recall that Acosta got the boot because he was the rudest and most aggressive lout in the room, but was not alone in trashing decorum. For two years, members of the Trump-hating press have used televised briefings and press conferences as a stage to let the world know how they feel about the president. While most reporters ask real questions, even pointed ones, Acosta and his ilk are engaged in a performance art that amounts to virtue signaling to their bosses and colleagues. “Look at me,” they seem to say. “I’m fighting back.” But it’s not the job of reporters to fight back. Theirs is to gather information, fairly and accurately, and let readers and viewers decide what to do with it. I know how quaint that sounds. But following that tried-and-true formula is how the media built its credibility. The abandonment of decorum is part of the abandonment of standards and is destroying public trust. Over and over, Acosta makes himself the story, which is not appealing, even for some anti-Trumpers. This was hardly the first time Acosta starred in his own drama. Over and over, he makes himself the story, which is not appealing, even for some anti-Trumpers. Indeed, the response to my column supporting the initial suspension reveals that Americans on both sides of the Trump line believe manners still matter. They differ over who is at fault, with Trump supporters seeing most journalists as Democrats with press passes, while Acosta supporters mostly argue he was justified in behaving badly because Trump does, too. As reader Dave Druten put it, “Respecting a president is preferred conduct, but kowtowing to a proven liar is not proper journalism. You need to address the root of the problem and not the symptoms of disrespect it has spawned.” Reader Deanne Payne offers yet another view, saying that, although she is not a Trump supporter, she is disturbed by media bias and the lack of professionalism. “I am a nurse and I care for people of all walks of life and my biases, as part of my job, have to be checked at the door,” she writes. “The approach by many in the media is undignified and disgraceful.” Payne is on to something, both in moral and practical terms. The idea of using someone else’s conduct to justify your misconduct is childish. Go to any playground and you’ll hear a chorus of “he started it” defenses. It’s simply laughable when adults use that lame excuse, which is what Acosta and his defenders are doing. As for the practical fallout, there are good reasons why trust of the press is at an all-time low. The 2016 election was in part a referendum on the elite media’s disdain for Trump and his supporters. For many of them, conduct like Acosta’s confirms Trump’s “fake news” charges because they see in him the kind of journalist they do not trust to tell the truth. And with surveys consistently showing 90 percent of presidential coverage is negative, it is hard to fault their conclusion. Besides, the president, like all Americans, enjoys First Amendment rights, and nothing in the oath of office requires him to suffer an unfair beating in silence. Still, instead of engaging in endless combat with press-pass partisans, Trump has other options. He could bar cameras at the daily briefings and without a TV audience, the Acosta types would be unlikely to don their Superman capes. Trump could also reduce the frequency of the briefings or cancel them entirely. He could substitute more one-on-one interviews for press conferences. He could, in fact, shun the media altogether because none of these traditions of contact are fundamental or even tangential to freedom of the press. The First Amendment is a key to American liberty in glorious ways, but it is not an excuse for bad manners. It is a tragedy of our era that the media must be reminded of that common-sense truth.

On Thursday, he denied chaos has returned to the West Wing - then lashed out at Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III. (Photo by John T. Bennett/CQ Roll Call) Despite evidence to the contrary, President Donald Trump on Thursday denied chaos has returned to the West Wing — then immediately fired off a broadside against Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Trump was visibly agitated during a weekend diplomatic trip to Paris, including frustration with aides who advised that him canceling a Saturday trip to a cemetery where nearly 2,000 U.S. soldiers who died in World War I are buried would not become a major news story. It did and Trump reportedly let his staff know about his frustration. He also did not hide his annoyance with French President Emmanuel Macron during his time in Paris before lashing out at him Tuesday morning.  Back in Washington, the president spent much of Monday holed up in the White House residence. He did not go to Arlington National Cemetery to honor fallen military members even though it was the federal holiday observing Veterans Day, which was on Sunday. A Roll Call reporter never saw the Marine guard outside the West Wing doors that signals the president is in the West Wing. [You’re Reassigned! Trump Does Not Fire Key Adviser Under Fire] Earlier this week, an internal riff with his wife, Melania Trump, over Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, who clashed with the first lady during her recent swing through Africa. After his wife asked in private that Ricardel be fired, her office told inquiring reporters that the first lady wanted Ricardel terminated. On Tuesday, Trump used a Diwali ceremony at the White House to chide FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, apparently for his decision to nix a proposed merger between Sinclair Broadcast Group with Tribune Media. The president said he did not like the decision, without naming it, "one little bit," and seemed to deride that Pai "is independent" of any presidential authorities. All of that was happening amid speculation that Trump is about to follow his ouster of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a broader purge that could include Chief of Staff John Kelly and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen — possible changes that Trump shrugged off during a press conference last week, saying everyone eventually leaves every administration. “The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world,” the president wrote as snow fell outside the White House. He then blamed the “FAKE NEWS MEDIA” for “always seeking to make us look as bad as possible!” The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!  But CNN cited a source saying this about Trump's mindset since the midterm elections that say the GOP lose control of the House: “Yes, he's pissed — at damn near everyone.” The president, who in a court filing said he can revoke any reporter’s White House press pass, called the media “crazy.” He then turned his sights on Mueller and his team, labeling them “absolutely nuts.” [Eager for Lame Duck Win, Trump Backs Prison Reform Bill] “The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,” adding his view that the special counsel has “found no collusion.” “They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,” Trump wrote, offering not a single example nor anecdote of such tactics. Though some Republican lawmakers and advisers have counseled the president against using harsh rhetoric toward Mueller and his team because it creates optics of chaos around him, Trump did just that on Thursday. Watch: Trump Says He Doesn’t Know Matt Whitaker He called Mueller and his staff “a disgrace to our Nation,” alleging they do not “care how many lives the ruin.” The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don’t...  Trump noted Mueller was FBI director under Democratic President Barack Obama, but excluded that he interviewed Mueller to return to the post just a day before he became special counsel. And in his signature fashion, the president ended his Twitter rant in all capital letters: “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!” ....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Fox News Channel Decision Team member Daron Shaw breaks down the numbers. Less than three weeks until Election Day, voters are thinking most about health care, the economy, and reining in President Trump -- and Democratic candidates are benefitting. Currently, 49 percent of likely voters back the Democratic candidate in their House district and 42 percent the Republican, according to a new Fox News national survey. That 7-point lead is unchanged from last month, and just outside the poll’s margin of error. Nine percent will vote for someone else or are undecided. "If the election were today, the House would most likely flip," says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. "Republicans keep waiting for the national numbers to tighten, but they have been remarkably stable this campaign season." CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Here's how we get there: -- Top issue: Health care. While majorities of likely voters say the economy (54 percent) and President Trump (51 percent) will be "extremely" important to their House vote, more voters feel that way about health care (58 percent) -- and that group prefers the Democratic candidate by a 24-point margin. Meanwhile, a majority disapproves of how Trump is handling health care. -- Guardrails for Trump. By a 53-41 percent margin, likely voters say having the next Congress be a check on the president is more important than helping Trump enact his policies. In counties where the 2016 vote was close (Hillary Clinton and Trump within 10 points), a majority of 56 percent want a check on Trump, and Democrats lead the generic ballot in these counties by 12 points. -- Trump job performance. The president’s job rating is underwater by 4 points (47-51 percent). Trump gets net negative ratings on health care (-16 points), immigration (-14 points), Supreme Court nominees (-8), and border security and trade (both -7). At a negative 22, race relations is his worst issue. He receives positive marks for handling hurricanes (+2) and the economy (+6). -- The economy and family finances. Fewer voters are confident in their personal financial future compared to 2015. At that time, 73 percent felt certain. Today, that’s 68 percent. The ratings are highly partisan, as twice as many Republicans (41 percent) as Democrats (19 percent) feel “very” confident in their financial future. Likewise, 73 percent of Republicans rate the economy positively, while 33 percent of Democrats agree. Overall, views are mixed: 49 percent feel the economy is in excellent or good shape vs. 48 percent saying only fair or poor. -- Popularity contest. More voters have a favorable view than an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party by 3 points, while the Republican Party rating is a net negative by 7 and President Trump is under water by 9. The Me Too Movement rating is +16. -- Women. There’s a wide gender gap, as women likely voters support the Democratic candidate by 18 points, while men back the Republican by 6. Since 2016, white women have shifted from backing Trump by 9 points to backing the Democrat by 2 points today. Democrats are up by 56 points among non-white women, by 35 points with women under age 45, and by 19 points among suburban women. -- GOP positions out of favor. The only issue that draws clear support for the GOP candidate is border security, as those naming it as extremely important to their vote back the Republican by 23 points. Seventy percent of likely voters favor a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently working in the U.S. More like Obamacare (54 percent favorable) than the tax cut law (45 percent favorable) -- plus health care (58 percent) is extremely important to more voters than taxes (44 percent) when it comes to their congressional vote. -- Kavanaugh. Likely voters split over Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court: 47 approve vs. 48 disapprove. And the 46 percent saying Supreme Court nominations are extremely important to their vote are more likely to favor the Democrat by 7 points. -- Enthusiasm. Voters who backed Clinton two years ago are more likely than Trump 2016 voters to say this election outcome is “extremely” important (by 14 points), more likely to be “extremely” interested (by 11 points), and also more likely than Trump voters to be motivated by enthusiasm for their candidate rather than by fear the other candidate might win (by 7 points). -- Motivation. When asked to name what one issue will motivate them to vote this year (without the aid of a list), the top three mentioned by likely voters are health care (13 percent), reining in Trump (10), and the economy (9). Next, it is Democrats getting control of Congress (8 percent), immigration reform (7), and border security (5). -- White voters. Whites are more likely to back the GOP candidate by 8 points. In 2014, they voted for the Republicans by 22 points. -- Certainty. Groups with the largest number saying they are certain to vote include very conservatives (89 percent), voters ages 45+ (87), voters with a college degree (86), and suburban women (84). Those with the lowest share certain to vote include Trump approvers (79 percent), voters without a college degree (77), and men under 45 (68). Pollpourri -- Majorities of likely voters are “extremely” concerned about the affordability of health care (65 percent), denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions (62), and people losing health insurance (61). Fewer say the same about a government takeover of health care (40). "It's clear that every day the news is dominated by another political outrage or controversy is a missed opportunity for Democrats," says Anderson. "Voters are broadly in agreement with Democrats on health care and the more focus on the issue the better for them." -- Two-thirds feel political correctness in this country has gone too far, including 82 percent of Republicans, 62 percent of independents, and 48 percent of Democrats. -- Overall, 51 percent feel extremely or very concerned political disagreements these days will lead to violence -- and on that, roughly equal numbers of Democrats (52 percent) and Republicans (50 percent) agree. -- While ratings of Congress remain low, 23 percent approve, that’s up from 15 percent in January. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,007 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 13-16, 2018. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. For the subgroup of 841 likely voters, the margin of sampling error is also plus or minus three points.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why no matter what President Trump does, or doesn't do, he still ends up as the top story dominating the news cycle. The press just can't quit Donald Trump. No matter what he does — or doesn't do — he's the story. The biggest story. Often the only story. And that story, the continuous story, inevitably involves we the media. The president excels at dragging the news business into the center of every controversy, and its members all too often fall into the trap. Even the recent chatter about whether media outlets should boycott White House press briefings puts them in a potential confrontation with Trump, which is just the way he likes it. The president was in Paris over the weekend, for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, and this Washington Post story yesterday encapsulates the addictive nature of the coverage. The lead notes that "on a trip to Europe, the president hardly said a word — and he still managed to outrage at almost every turn." But is that alleged outrage fanned by the media? And if Trump generates outrage whether he speaks or not, isn't that a telling statement? Other than one critical tweet about Emmanuel Macron (based on an inaccurate newspaper story, the Post notes), "Trump didn't throw any sharp elbows at his peers here. It was still all about him." Translation: The media still made it all about him. The newspaper's take is that "it was because of the images. He looked uncomfortable and listless in a bilateral meeting with Macron, whose sinewy energy stood in stark contrast to Trump's downbeat expression as the French leader patted him on the thigh." We can't have that! Trump also skipped a scheduled tour of a military cemetery for Americans, blaming the rain. And by the way, that was a legitimate issue to cover, as it felt like a snub by a president who had gone to France in part to honor the sacrifices made by our soldiers. At an event at the Arc de Triomphe, Stone sat "stone-faced as Macron railed against the rise of nationalism — a rebuke of Trump's professed worldview. The overall takeaway to many was a president turning away from the world, a man occupying the office of the leader of the free world who appeared withdrawn and unenthusiastic on the global stage." And the first quote was a tweet by former Obama aide David Axelrod, who said, "America First feels like America Alone." The president made huge news on previous foreign trips by getting into confrontations with other western leaders. But on a trip where he largely avoided public conflict, for whatever reason, Trump still drew negative coverage. (He offered a different take on Twitter: "Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders. Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasn't, on both Military and Trade.") Meanwhile, CNN filed suit this morning to force the White House to restore Jim Acosta's credentials. The Trump team suspended the credentials last week after a dustup in which he refused to stop asking the president questions or give up the microphone. New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg weighed in yesterday on the fallout. To his credit, Rutenberg pointed out that Acosta "is a somewhat polarizing figure, viewed by some of his press corps colleagues as a showboat." The White House suspended Acosta's credentials after a dustup in which he refused to stop asking Trump questions or give up the microphone. To his credit, Rutenberg pointed out that Acosta "is a somewhat polarizing figure, viewed by some of his press corps colleagues as a showboat." After noting that CNN President Jeff Zucker told his producers not to play up the Acosta punishment, the column said that "CNN would not be led by the nose into giving significant airtime to another Trump attack on the news media ... "Reporters could stage a group protest. But that would make them look like they're at war with the president, just as he always says they are. Or they could do nothing and effectively 'submit to his authority to determine who gets to hold him accountable,'" as GOP strategist and fierce Trump critic Steve Schmidt put it. It's a no-win situation. And here's why a boycott wouldn't work: — Much of the country would turn on the press for not doing its job. Refusing to show up at briefings is a very tough sell. — Trump would pound away at the media, saying they have moved into the opposition camp. — Journalists would be seen as hopelessly self-absorbed if they surrendered the chance to question the White House press secretary on the public's behalf. — And most important of all, it would never happen. There's no way all the disparate media outlets, with their varying interests, would agree to a joint boycott, and the show would go on. This is actually somewhat symbolic since Sarah Huckabee Sanders is now briefing only rarely as her boss takes more and more questions from reporters. But it highlights once again that most media debates these days are about Donald Trump — and the media.

---split---16.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/appropriations-endgame-roads-lead-wall---split---Border Patrol vehicles stand guard along the United States-Mexico border fence in on Sunday, Aug. 10, 2014. The fence runs through the cities of Calexico, Calif., and Mexicali on the Mexico side. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Sooner or later, President Donald Trump will have to confront the political reality that Congress is extremely unlikely to provide the $5 billion he wants to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That realization has to occur in less than a month, with the House and Senate both in session for only 12 legislative days before the current stopgap funding measure expires Dec. 7. And the longer policymakers delay in figuring out how to handle the divisive wall project, the more likely it is Congress will have to punt the remaining seven fiscal 2019 spending bills into the new year, including the Homeland Security measure, which funds Customs and Border Protection construction accounts. [PODCAST: Democrat to Reshape Priorities on Spending Panel] The dispute to some extent has to be resolved before appropriators can move forward on outstanding appropriations bills, including a four-bill package that’s been sitting in conference since September. That’s because every dollar claimed for other programs is a dollar taken away from making Trump’s $5 billion wish come true. The Border Wall Funding Fight Could Lead to Another CR, or Partial Federal Shutdown There’s also the question of additional disaster aid in the wake of the latest deadly California wildfire outbreak. The Senate Appropriations Committee’s ranking member, Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., told reporters Monday his committee was preparing to add $720 million in emergency funds to a year-end spending bill. That amount could increase as other disaster needs are tallied, such as rebuilding after hurricanes Michael and Florence. But Trump has taken issue with California’s management of fire prevention programs, indicating that more money for wildfire suppression could also get caught up in the transactional nature of Trump’s negotiating style. “Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” Trump tweeted over the weekend. That’s a dicey way to start negotiations with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who’s in line to take over the speaker’s gavel next year. In addition, partisan disputes over policy riders, dealing with matters such as protecting Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation from White House interference, are stuck in limbo given Trump’s penchant for hardball tactics. Each bone of contention is leverage for Trump’s wall, perhaps the most visible promise he has made both during his campaign and since he’s been in office. The more Trump digs in, the more Democrats are likely to push on matters such as demanding acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker’s recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation. Ultimately, the question of what happens to the remaining fiscal 2019 spending bills, and when, boils down to the following question: Can lawmakers reach a deal with the White House on some level of wall-related funding between the $5 billion in the House’s Homeland Security measure for “technology and physical barriers” and the Senate’s $1.6 billion worth of “pedestrian fencing”? There are early indications that Trump and Hill Democrats are ready to deal. In his post-midterm press conference, Trump said he wouldn’t necessarily accept a partial shutdown if the spending bill due Dec. 7 doesn’t have the full $5 billion. “I can’t commit to that,” Trump said. And on Monday, Leahy said his party was ready to talk more broadly about additional border security needs. “I’m willing to make some compromises provided we can get it done,” he said. But Leahy hinted that Democrats are ready to play a little “Art of the Deal” themselves if Trump makes some other concessions. “I’d want to see where it’s being spent . . . I can’t speak for my whole caucus, but there are a whole lot of aspects that are involved here, not the least of which are all the poison-pill riders in the House bill,” Leahy said. His comments echo Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who said last week he’d had “great discussions” on border security already with the other top Hill leaders of both parties. “I would hope that the president wouldn’t interfere and we would get something good done,” Schumer said. Where the money will come from to get $5 billion, whether for the wall itself or some other border infrastructure, is anyone’s guess. And it’s part of the reason why the House held back the four-bill spending package — consisting of the fiscal 2019 Agriculture, Interior-Environment, Financial Services and Transportation-HUD measures — after Senate negotiators were ready to sign off in late September. The problem is that Trump has already signed into law five spending bills, which limits the money available under the discretionary caps for fiscal 2019. About 97 percent of the remainder, or $305 billion, is for nondefense programs, according to CQ calculations based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. That includes most of the Homeland Security Department, including CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The House versions of the seven remaining bills already start out at a deficit; they are $736 million over the $597 billion nondefense cap, according to the CBO. In other words, if the bills were enacted as the House has drafted them, the Office of Management and Budget within 15 days would have to order an across-the-board cut to every nonexempt program to eliminate the excess. The four bills currently in conference hover around the $154 billion mark for both chambers’ versions. The Senate versions are a combined $481 million above the House’s, however — money which could be reserved for the wall. Going down to the lowest amount either chamber has passed for each of the titles would free up even more. But then priorities ranging from food safety inspection to infrastructure would get shortchanged. Either way, it begs the question of why Trump would sign the four-bill package and take money off the table that he thinks could be better spent along the border. And then there are the three remaining bills that have not advanced to the floor of either chamber: Homeland Security, Commerce-Justice-Science and State-Foreign Operations. Using the lower House numbers for the latter two measures would free up an additional nearly $1.1 billion that could be put towards border security if the negotiations were opened up to encompass all seven outstanding fiscal 2019 bills. All told, shaving the remaining allocations for the seven bills down to the lowest of either chamber’s version would free up room for north of $4 billion in wall money — not quite Trump’s demand, but enough to say he got a pretty good deal. The other option is a continuing resolution for some or all of the remaining bills, which could make room for up to $11.2 billion in nondefense savings that could be used for some pretty sizable funding “anomalies,” including billions in wall funding. Conservatives would get a big win, and Trump would get his wall. But the Census Bureau would be deprived of money needed to conduct the 2020 Census, for instance. On what planet would Democrats agree to shortchanging their own domestic priorities in such a fashion, especially after last week’s midterm results? The best option, at least from the standpoint of appropriators and the federal agencies they provide money for, would be to wrap all seven remaining fiscal 2019 bills before the 115th Congress adjourns. That could involve splitting the funding differences between the chambers and getting somewhere into the $3 billion ballpark for the wall, or around double the previous fiscal year. There is some confidence an outcome like that can be achieved. But as always with the last legislative train leaving the station, appropriators also recognize there are higher powers at work. “Appropriators left to their own devices will get to a deal. The real question is will they be left to their own devices,” House Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Sunday may be a day of rest for a lot of people – but it clearly wasn't this week for President Trump. In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the president addressed a range of topics – including the behavior of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta and his appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. He also answered questions about this month’s elections, his written responses to Special Counsel Robert Mueller and foreign policy concerns regarding North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. But the president also had an active day on Twitter, starting off with a highly noticed critique of a frequent Trump critic, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!” Trump wrote, altering the spelling of the lawmaker’s last name. More than 57,000 readers responded to the message – including Schiff. “Wow, Mr. President, that’s a good one,” Schiff wrote. “Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller’s questions, or did you write this one yourself?” In other Trump tweets on Sunday, the president expressed solidarity with the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, saying the U.S., like Tijuana, was “ill-prepared” to absorb the caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico toward the U.S. border. Trump also urged Democrats to “approve Border Security & Wall NOW!” But on “FOX News Sunday,” in a taped interview with host Chris Wallace, Trump was able to go beyond the confines of Twitter’s 280-character limit to share his thoughts on a variety of recent topics. Here are some highlights: On CNN’s Jim Acosta: Trump said CNN’s White House correspondent was “unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee” during a recent press briefing. Although a judge recently ordered that Acosta’s revoked White House press pass be returned, if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference," the president warned. On acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker: Trump told Wallace he was unaware of Whitaker’s past remarks about the Mueller investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia when he appointed Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice. "I did not know that," Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued Mueller was coming close to exceeding his authority. "I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.” On GOP election wins in Florida: "Look at Florida," Trump said. "I went down to Florida. [GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. I don’t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end. And if I didn’t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.” "Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. ... if I didn’t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost.” On North Korea: Trump told Wallace that former President Barack Obama had offered him some important guidance in the White House shortly after his 2016 election. “I think North Korea’s been very tough because you know we were very close. When I took that over -- President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that’s by far the biggest problem that this country has," Trump said. "And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I’m very happy with the way we went." On Saudi Arabia: "You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia," Trump said. "But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.” On Pakistan: “We give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year . ... [bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we’re supporting Pakistan, we’re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don’t give them anymore, by the way. I ended it because they don’t do anything for us, they don’t do a damn thing for us.” Finally … Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. "I should have done that," Trump said. "I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ... I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.” Fox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this story.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why, if Donald Trump is such a terrible president, the Democrats aren't the overwhelming favorites in the midterm elections. As the media are awash in predictions and prognostications about today's elections, one question I find fascinating is this: Why haven't the Democrats run away with this thing? After all, if Donald Trump is as terrible a president as the press has been proclaiming for nearly two years, the opposition party should be riding a wave of revulsion to victory. The Dems are favored to win the 23 seats needed to win the House, and some pundits are saying they'll take considerably more, but the fact that even the minimum outcome is in doubt shows a far more competitive election than was forecast a month or two ago. So perhaps Trump, and the Republican candidates following his lead, are better at electoral politics than the wise guys thought. And you can't blame it all on "fear-mongering," even though the president has chosen to close on immigration rather than the booming economy. There is no question that these midterms are largely about Trump, and that he has quite consciously ensured that his name is virtually, though not literally, on the ballot. A provocative theory comes from Ross Douthat, the conservative New York Times columnist and a sharp Trump critic. He cites the often-vast "gulf" between "the hysteria of liberals who write about politics for a living and the relative calm of Democrats who practice it." He says that on liberal Twitter, democracy itself hangs in the balance "and every Trump provocation a potential Reichstag fire. But on the campaign trail, with some exceptions and variations, Democrats are being upbeat and talking about health care and taxes and various ambitious policy ideas, as though this is still America and not Weimar, a normal time and not a terrifying one." Maybe the liberal pundits are saying things that the politicians can't, but Douthat argues the Democrats are very lucky. If Trump had governed like a "generic Republican," he'd be more popular and the Democrats would be toast. And if Trump had followed through on the populist promises of 2016, Douthat says, "this strategy could have easily cut the knees out from under the Democrats' strongest appeal, their more middle-class-friendly economic agenda, and highlighted their biggest liability, which is the way the party's base is pulling liberalism way left of the middle on issues of race and culture and identity." In this view, Trump drives liberals crazy with his culture war and Twitter crusades, but this in turn lets the Democrats off the hook. I'd be cautious about even the smart analysts who say if only Trump had done this or that, he'd be in a stronger position. Who among them thought Trump would ever win the White House? He has a gut feeling about elections, and while it's fine to criticize his tone, language and choice of subjects, he may well be right that warning about illegal immigration gets more Republicans to the polls than boasting about last year's tax cut. A more vociferous Never-Trumper, NYT conservative Bret Stephens, says the president may have outwitted the opposition by pounding away at the caravan: "To which the Democratic response is — what, exactly? "If it’s 'compassion,' it’s a non-answer. If it's to abolish ICE, it's a dereliction of responsibility for governance. If it's to open the border, it is an honest form of political suicide. If it's more trade and foreign aid for Central America, that's a solution for the too-long term. "The truth is that there is no easy fix to the challenge of the caravan, which is why Trump was so clever to make the issue his own and Democrats have been so remiss in letting him have it. The secret of Trump's politics is to mix fear and confidence — the threat of disaster and the promise of protection — like salt and sugar, simultaneously stimulating and satisfying an insatiable appetite." Stephens goes on to attack Trump as a demagogue. But whose fault is it if the Democrats don’t have an effective response? If Nancy Pelosi's party wins the House, the media verdict will be that the Democrats pursued the right strategy and that Trump's immigration-based appeal failed. If Pelosi and company fall short, the media will give them partial blame, but will largely conclude that (as a Washington Post news story put it yesterday) "running a campaign built on blunt, race-based attacks on immigrants and minorities will have been validated." But I come back to my original question: If Trump is as terrible as many pundits say, why aren't the Democrats running away with the election?

Answer: Generally, we rely on respondents’ self-identification. A key question we ask in many surveys is: “What is your present religion, if any? Are you Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon, Orthodox such as Greek or Russian Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, something else, or nothing in particular?” Those who answer this question by describing themselves as “Protestant” are categorized as Protestants. Some respondents (roughly one-in-ten or more, on average, in recent surveys) answer the question by volunteering that they are “Christian” or “just Christian,” and they, too, are categorized as Protestants. Respondents who say they belong to nondenominational Christian churches also go into the broad Protestant category. Those who describe themselves as “Catholic” or “Roman Catholic” are categorized as Catholics. And the large – and growing – number of survey respondents who describe themselves as “atheist,” “agnostic” or “nothing in particular” are often combined into an umbrella group called the religiously unaffiliated (sometimes also called the religious “nones”). Similarly, those who describe themselves as “Mormon,” “Orthodox,” “Jewish,” “Muslim,” “Buddhist” or “Hindu” are categorized as such in Pew Research Center reporting. Many Pew Research Center surveys encounter too few respondents from these smaller religious groups to permit analysis of their views and characteristics.1 However, the Center’s larger surveys (like the 35,000 person U.S. Religious Landscape Study) do make it possible to report on the characteristics of these groups. In addition, the Center has conducted several surveys designed specifically to capture the views of smaller religious groups in the U.S., including three surveys of U.S. Muslims, a 2013 survey of U.S. Jews, a 2012 survey of Asian Americans (including large samples of Buddhists and Hindus), and a 2011 survey of U.S. Mormons. Respondents who answer by describing their religion as “something else” are asked to specify further. Many of them provide answers suggesting they belong in one of the existing categories, and they are categorized accordingly. For example, after first saying “something else,” many respondents specify that they are Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, etc., and are subsequently categorized as Protestants. Others say they are “LDS” (an abbreviation for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) and are coded as Mormons, while still others give a variety of answers (e.g., “Sunni” or “Sufi”) that indicate they are Muslims. The few remaining respondents (typically 1% or 2% of all respondents) who specify something that does not belong in any of the existing categories (including members of smaller religious groups like Sikhs, Baha’is and Rastafarians, as well as those who say they are “spiritual but not religious” or that they have their “own beliefs”) remain categorized as “something else.” We sometimes use a more expansive definition, which includes not just people who identify religiously with a group, but also those who self-identify culturally or ethnically. For example, the Center’s 2013 survey of U.S. Jews included both respondents who described themselves as Jewish when asked about their religion as well as those who described themselves (religiously) as “atheist,” “agnostic,” or “nothing in particular” if they also currently considered themselves Jewish or partially Jewish “aside from religion,” and they were raised Jewish or had a Jewish parent. Similarly, our 2015 survey of U.S. Catholics and Family Life included analysis of “cultural Catholics” in addition to those who identified as Catholic by religion. Instances of this kind of more expansive approach to defining groups are rare, however, and are clearly noted in our reports. But what about Catholics who don’t attend church? Can someone really be Catholic if they don’t attend Mass regularly? Similarly, what about Mormons who don’t believe in God? Can someone who doesn’t believe in God be Mormon? Answer: In our surveys, members of religious groups are categorized based on their self-identification with the group, not on the basis of their religious beliefs or practices. We do ask about beliefs and practices, but those are separate questions. This allows us to see, for example, that among self-described Catholics, roughly four-in-ten say they attend religious services at least once a week, while a similar share say they attend Mass once or twice a month or a few times a year, and one-in-five say they seldom or never attend Mass. All are categorized as Catholics in the Center’s reports, though in many of our larger surveys, we are able to break down the Catholic category into subgroups and compare Catholics who say they go to Mass weekly with those who attend less often. Defining religious categories on the basis of self-identification has a number of benefits, chief among them that this kind of approach makes it possible to describe the diversity of belief and practice that exists within every religious tradition in the U.S. Some religious traditions are composed of people who overwhelmingly profess to believe in the unique teachings of their faith. For example, the Center’s 2011 survey of U.S. Mormons found that 94% of self-described Mormons believe that the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a prophet of God, and 91% believe that the Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets and translated by Joseph Smith. The same survey found that 82% of Mormons say religion is very important in their lives, and 77% say they attend religious services on at least a weekly basis. Other religious groups exhibit lower levels of uniformity. For example, Americans who identify as Jewish when asked about their religion are roughly evenly divided between those who say religion is very important in their lives (31%), those who say it is somewhat important in their lives (35%), and those who say religion is “not too” or “not at all” important in their lives (33%). Pew Research Center surveys even find that a few self-described atheists say they believe in God or a universal spirit. There are a number of possible explanations for this paradox. Some respondents may identify as atheists because they reject traditional images of God, even though they believe there is some spiritual force in the universe. Others may identify as atheist primarily as a means of registering an objection to organized religion. And a few self-described atheists are unclear on what, exactly, the word “atheist” means. Whatever the explanation, the larger point is that no religious group in the U.S. is a monolith. There is diversity of belief and practice within every religious tradition, and defining religious traditions on the basis of self-identification makes it possible to illustrate the multiplicity of belief and practice inside each group. In short, we do not seek to make any judgments about what characteristics may or may not disqualify someone from a particular group. This can often be a matter of opinion; for example, most U.S. Jews say a person cannot be Jewish if he or she believes Jesus was the messiah, but a substantial minority disagree. As a neutral research organization, Pew Research Center does not take positions on these sorts of debates. Protestants are the single largest religious group in the United States. But Pew Research Center usually disaggregates them into several subgroups (for example, evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, black Protestants). How do you do this? Answer: To categorize Protestants into subgroups, we typically choose between two different methods, depending on the survey. In most of our surveys, we employ a self-identification approach, which relies on information about respondents’ race and whether they self-identify as a “born-again or evangelical Christian” to sort them into subgroups. In some of our largest surveys, however, we employ a denominational approach, in which Protestants are sorted into subgroups based on the specific denomination with which they identify. In many of the Center’s surveys, including most of our political polling, respondents are asked the religious identification question described above: “What is your present religion, if any? Are you Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon, Orthodox such as Greek or Russian Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, something else, or nothing in particular?” Then, in addition, all Christians (including people who identify as any type of Protestant as well as Catholics, Mormons, etc.) are asked a follow-up question: “Would you describe yourself as a born-again or evangelical Christian, or not?” Finally, all respondents receive a standard series of demographic questions, including about their race/ethnicity. By combining the answers to all these questions, we generally divide Protestants into three groups. Most Pew Research Center surveys do not obtain enough interviews with Hispanic Protestants or other minority Protestants to be able to analyze them separately. While the self-identification approach outlined above is the way the Center typically analyzes subgroups of Protestants, it is not the only approach used in the Center’s analyses. Specifically, in the Center’s two large Religious Landscape Studies, first conducted in 2007 and then again in 2014, Protestants are categorized into one of three major traditions (evangelicalism, mainline Protestantism, or the historically black Protestant tradition) using a denominational approach.2 The denominational approach employed in the Landscape Studies requires asking a longer series of detailed questions about religious affiliation than can be carried on a typical survey. The first question in the series is identical to the one described above: “What is your present religion, if any? Are you Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon, Orthodox such as Greek or Russian Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, something else, or nothing in particular?” Second, Protestants (and those who volunteer that they are “Christian” or “just Christian”) are asked about what denominational family they identify with. Specifically, Protestants are asked, “As far as your present religion, what denomination or church, if any, do you identify with most closely? Just stop me when I get to the right one. Are you Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Episcopalian or Anglican, Church of Christ or Disciples of Christ, Congregational or United Church of Christ, Holiness, Reformed, Church of God, nondenominational or independent church, something else, or none in particular?” Finally, Protestants receive a third question based on their answer to the second question – and sometimes based also on their race. Baptists who are not black, for example, are asked, “Which of the following Baptist churches, if any, do you identify with most closely? The Southern Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., an independent Baptist church, or some other Baptist church?” Baptists who are black are asked, “Which of the following Baptist churches, if any, do you identify with most closely? The National Baptist Convention, the Progressive Baptist Convention, or some other Baptist church?” Presbyterians of all races are asked: “Which of the following Presbyterian churches, if any, do you identify with most closely? The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Presbyterian Church in America, or some other Presbyterian church?” And those identifying with other denominational families are asked a similar question tailored specifically to them. (For the full list of the questions asked and their exact question wording, see the Landscape Study questionnaire.) The information gleaned from this series of questions is used to categorize Protestants as members of the evangelical, mainline, or historically black Protestant tradition based as much as possible on their specific denominational affiliation, and not on their answers to the born-again/evangelical self-identification question (to the extent it can be avoided).3 When this denominational measurement strategy is employed, evangelicals and mainline Protestants can include nonwhites, and the historically black Protestant tradition can include nonblacks. For example, all people who self-identify with the Southern Baptist Convention are classified as evangelicals (even if they are not white and even if they do not self-identify as born-again or evangelical Christians). All people who identify with the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A. are categorized as mainline Protestants (even if they do identify as “born-again or evangelical Christians”).4And all people who self-identify with the National Baptist Convention are categorized in the historically black Protestant tradition (even if they are not black).5 Complete details about the denominational approach to categorizing Protestants are available in an appendix to the Religious Landscape Study reports. Despite the detailed religious affiliation questions in the Religious Landscape Studies, many respondents (more than a third of all Protestants in the 2014 study) are either unable or unwilling to describe their specific denominational affiliation.6 For instance, some respondents describe themselves as “just a Lutheran” or “just a Presbyterian” or “just a Methodist.” In these cases, respondents are sorted into one of the three Protestant traditions (evangelical, mainline, or historically black Protestant tradition) in two ways: Overall, 38% of Protestants in the 2014 Landscape Study offered a vague denominational identity and were classified, in part, on the basis of their race and/or their answer to the question about whether they identify as a born-again or evangelical Christian. For a discussion of how Protestant groups compare to each other depending on which measurement strategy (the self-identification approach or denominational approach) is employed, see Question 7 below. Aren’t most black Protestants evangelicals? And if so, then why do you analyze them separately in so many reports? Answer: Most nonwhite Protestants (70%), including 71% of African American Protestants, say “yes” when asked directly whether they consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. And in terms of their religious beliefs and practices, there are, indeed, a number of important ways in which white evangelicals and evangelical minorities closely resemble each other. For example, 84% of white born-again or evangelical Protestants say religion is very important in their lives, and 88% of nonwhite evangelicals say the same, including 92% of black evangelical Protestants who say this. And more than eight-in-ten white evangelicals say they pray every day (83%), as do 82% of nonwhite evangelicals (including 84% of black self-identified evangelicals). But while white and nonwhite evangelicals (including black evangelicals) share many religious characteristics in common, they are sharply divided when it comes to politics, and their views about many key social and cultural issues. White evangelicals, simply put, are among the most strongly Republican, conservative constituencies in American politics. By contrast, nonwhite evangelicals (especially black evangelicals) are among the most strongly and consistently Democratic groups in the U.S. electorate. Pew Research Center regularly focuses on public opinion on political and cultural topics, and this is why white evangelicals and black Protestants often are examined separately in our reports. When asked directly about their partisan leanings, nearly two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants say they lean toward or identify with the Republican Party, while just 22% lean toward or identify with the Democratic Party (the remaining 13% identify as political independents or with another party and decline to lean toward either the GOP or the Democratic Party). Among nonwhite evangelicals, these figures are reversed; 63% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while just 20% prefer the GOP. The Democratic advantage is especially lopsided among black evangelical Protestants, among whom eight-in-ten (79%) say they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, compared with just 10% who prefer the GOP. On this measure, there is no discernible difference between black evangelical Protestants and black non-evangelical Protestants, among whom 80% favor the Democratic Party and just 8% identify with or lean toward the GOP.7 In other words, with respect to partisanship, black evangelicals are much more in line with black non-evangelical Protestants than with white evangelicals.8 The same pattern is evident in voting behavior.9 In pre-election polling conducted during the 2016 presidential election, three-quarters of white evangelical Protestants indicated that they intended to vote for Republican Donald Trump (75%), compared with just 18% who intended to cast a ballot for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Among nonwhite evangelicals, these figures were reversed, with 71% expressing support for Clinton and just 22% saying they backed Trump. Among black evangelical Protestants, support for Clinton swelled to 92%, compared with just 5% who intended to vote for Trump. Whites also express much more affinity for the GOP than do nonwhites among non-evangelical Protestants, though they (white non-evangelical Protestants) are significantly less Republican than are white evangelicals. Nearly half of white non-evangelical Protestants identify with or lean toward the GOP, which is nearly three times the share of nonwhite, non-evangelical Protestants who say the same. And whereas 49% of white non-evangelical Protestants expressed an intention to vote for Trump in the 2016 election, just 19% of nonwhite, non-evangelical Protestants indicated they intended to vote for Trump. In short, there is no escaping the importance and explanatory power of race when it comes to partisanship and electoral politics. Analyses that explore the link between religion and partisanship or voting without taking race into account would obscure far more than they would illuminate. Doesn’t the strong support that Donald Trump received from white evangelicals suggest that the term “evangelical” is now a political label as much as a religious one? And isn’t it true that among whites, there are lots of self-described evangelicals who actually aren’t very religious, but who call themselves evangelicals just because they’re politically conservative or Republican? Answer: During the 2016 presidential campaign, some commentators expressed surprise at the high level of support Donald Trump received from white evangelical voters, and suggested that Trump’s rise may have been driven in large part by outsized support from evangelicals who are not particularly religious. But the notion that there are large numbers of white evangelicals (however defined) who are not particularly religious is false. Whether evangelicalism is defined by the denominational or the self-identification approach, white evangelicals are among the most religiously observant groups in the population. (For details on the difference between the denominational and the self-identification approach to subdividing Protestants, see Question 3 above.) Under the self-identification approach, 88% of white evangelical Protestants interviewed as part of the 2014 Religious Landscape Study score “high” on an index of religiosity that incorporates indicators of religious attendance, frequency of prayer, belief in God, and a self-assessment of religion’s importance in one’s life. While some other religious groups (including Mormons and black Protestants) exhibit similar levels of religiosity, there is no group that exhibits a significantly higher level of religious commitment, and many religious groups exhibit much lower levels of religiosity.10 Under the denominational approach, 83% of white evangelicals score high on the same scale. Have fewer people identified as evangelicals in recent years, in part because of the political connotations of the label? More specifically, are people who dislike President Trump abandoning the “evangelical” label for themselves because of evangelicals’ strong support for Trump? Answer: This is a difficult question to answer directly, in part because a definitive answer would require longitudinal data (that is, the same respondents would be interviewed on multiple occasions so researchers could see how their answers change over time). For the time being, the best we can do is to consider this question in the context of longer-term trends in American religion. Our data show, on the one hand, that the share of Americans who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants has been fairly stable in recent years. In 2009 (which was the first year Pew Research Center asked its now-standard question about religious identification and conducted most of its surveys in both English and Spanish), 28% of American adults identified as born-again or evangelical Protestants, and this figure held quite stable through 2015. (Trump declared his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015.) Between 2015 and 2017, however, there appears to have been a slight downturn in the share of Americans who identified as evangelical Protestants, which slipped to 26% in 2017. Surveys conducted thus far in 2018 suggest that the number may have recently rebounded to 27%, though it is too early, as of this writing, to know for sure.11 In short, surveys suggest that the share of self-described born-again or evangelical Protestants in the U.S. is either holding steady or declining very slightly. But even if there has been a slight decline in the share of Americans who identify as evangelical Protestants, it can only be understood against the backdrop of broader trends in American religion. The share of Americans who identify with Christianity writ large has been declining for some time. In 2009, more than three-quarters of U.S. adults (77%) identified with some kind of Christianity, including 51% who were Protestant, 23% who were Catholic, 2% who were Mormon and 1% who identified with Orthodox Christianity. By 2014, the share of adults identifying with Christianity had slipped to 71%. And today, 67% of Americans describe themselves as Christians, including 45% who are Protestant, 20% who are Catholic, 2% who are Mormon and 1% who identify with Orthodox Christianity. In other words, to the extent that there has been a decline in the share of Americans who identify as evangelicals, this is part of a broader shift away from Christianity altogether, and these trends long predate the emergence of Trump as a political force. Also, while the share of U.S. adults who identify with Christianity (including Protestantism) has been declining, among those who are Christian, the percentage who identify with the “born-again or evangelical” Protestant label is at least as high today (39%) as in 2009 (37%) or in the years immediately prior to Trump’s presidential bid (39% in both 2013 and 2014). This suggests that any decline in the share of born-again or evangelical Protestants in the U.S. population is attributable mainly to the decline in the share of Americans who identify with Christianity, and not to a decline in the share of Christians who identify with the “born-again or evangelical” Protestant label.12 While the share of Americans who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants is holding steady or perhaps declining very slightly, there has been a more clear-cut decline in the share of U.S. adults who are white born-again or evangelical Protestants. In 2009, 20% of U.S. adults were white born-again or evangelical Protestants. Today, 17% of U.S. adults fit this description. But here again, these trends were underway long before Trump’s emergence on the political scene, and they seem to have more to do with broader trends in American religion (including declines in the share identifying with Christianity) and with broader trends in the racial and ethnic composition of the population (including a decline in the share of all U.S. adults who are white) than they do with abandonment of the “born-again or evangelical” label. In Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2017 and early 2018, just under two-thirds of all respondents have been white (64%). A decade ago, by contrast, roughly seven-in-ten U.S. adults were white. As the share of adults who are white declined in recent years, so too did the share of whites who describe themselves as Christians. Today, two-thirds of whites (67%) identify as Christians, down from 77% in 2009. But while whites are declining as a share of the population, and identification with Christianity is declining among whites, the percentage of white Christians who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants is quite stable. In 2009, 37% of white Christians in the U.S. were born-again or evangelical Protestants. Today, 39% of white Christians describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Protestants. Among white Protestants, the share who currently identify as born-again or evangelical Christians (57%) may appear to be down slightly from its peak in late 2016 (59%). But the percentage of born-again or evangelical Christians among white Protestants is currently on par with estimates from 2014 and, if anything, slightly above readings taken in 2009 (53%) and 2011 (51%). These data do not prove that no one has abandoned the “born-again or evangelical” label due to concerns about the association between evangelicalism and support for Trump. There may be individuals who have distanced themselves from the “born-again or evangelical” label for exactly those reasons. And, by the same token, it is also possible that there are individuals who have come to adopt the “born-again or evangelical” label because of their admiration for Trump and their sense that evangelicals strongly support him. However, there is no evidence in Pew Research Center surveys that a sudden, mass movement away from evangelicalism began during the Trump administration or his presidential election campaign. The share of white born-again or evangelical Christians in the U.S. population has been declining, but this gradual shift seems to be part of long-term religious and demographic changes that have been underway for decades. Whether Trump’s popularity among white evangelicals has hastened (or slowed) this shift is not yet clear. What difference does the choice of approach for measuring Protestantism – denominational vs. self-identification – make for understanding the characteristics of Protestants? Answer: There is substantial overlap, but not a perfect match, between the denominational and self-identification approaches to categorizing Protestants. Both methods produce similar estimates of the size of the evangelical population, and they result in similar religious and demographic portraits of the major Protestant traditions.13 (For details on the difference between the denominational and the self-identification approach to subdividing Protestants, see Question 3 above.) To illustrate the overlap between the denominational and self-identification approaches, this analysis is restricted to whites who self-identify as Protestants, since the self-identification approach typically focuses on white born-again or evangelical Protestants and white non-evangelical Protestants, with black Protestants sorted into their own category (see Question 3 above for more details).14 In the 2014 Religious Landscape Study, more than three-quarters of white Protestants (78%) would have been categorized the same way under either the denominational or self-identification approach, including 49% who qualify as evangelicals under both the denominational and self-identification approaches and 29% who are categorized as non-evangelical (or mainline) Protestants under either approach. Just 22% of white Protestants would have been classified differently under the denominational and self-identification approaches. The data show, furthermore, that the correspondence between the denominational and self-identification approach is, if anything, growing closer over time. In the first Religious Landscape Study, conducted in 2007, a slightly smaller share of white Protestants (76%) would have been categorized the same way under both approaches. Looked at another way, the data show that fully eight-in-ten of those classified as white evangelical Protestants under the denominational approach (82%) answer the self-identification question affirmatively, saying yes when asked whether they would describe themselves as a born-again or evangelical Christian. And nearly three-quarters of those classified as mainline Protestants under the denominational approach (73%) answer the self-identification question by saying no, they do not consider themselves to be born-again or evangelical Christians.15 Similarly, the vast majority of white Protestants who self-identify as born-again or evangelical Christians are classified as evangelicals under the denominational approach (82%), and roughly seven-in-ten white Protestants who do not self-identify as born-again or evangelical Christians are categorized as mainline Protestants under the denominational approach. The data also show that the two approaches, the denominational approach and the self-identification method, produce identical estimates of the overall size of the white evangelical and non-evangelical (or mainline) Protestant categories. Using the denominational approach, the Landscape Study estimates that 19% of all U.S. adults are white evangelical Protestants and 13% of all U.S. adults are white mainline Protestants. The self-identification approach produces identical estimates; 19% of all U.S. adults are white born-again or evangelical Protestants, and 13% are white non-evangelical Protestants. The demographic profiles of evangelical and non-evangelical Protestants are exceedingly similar under either measurement approach. For example, 54% of white evangelicals are women when the denominational strategy is employed, and 55% of white evangelicals are women when the self-identification approach is used. With respect to educational attainment, the data show that 34% of white mainline Protestants defined using the denominational approach are college graduates, as are 33% of white non-evangelical Protestants under the self-identification approach. Evangelicals as defined using the denominational method are somewhat younger than self-identified evangelicals, and mainline Protestants defined by the denominational method are somewhat older than non-evangelical Protestants categorized as such under the self-identification method. Overall, however, the two methods for classifying white Protestants produce very similar demographic profiles. Religiously, white evangelical Protestants are much more observant than are white mainline Protestants under both the denominational and self-identification approaches to categorization. For instance, 83% of white evangelical Protestants as defined by the self-identification approach say they pray every day, as do 48% of white mainline Protestants; the gap, then, between the share of white evangelicals who pray every day and the share of white mainline Protestants who do the same is 35 points under the self-identification approach. When white Protestants are divided into evangelical and mainline categories using their denominational affiliation, the gap in daily prayer is 26 points (79% among evangelicals vs. 53% among mainline Protestants). The data reveal a similar pattern with respect to political opinions. Evangelicals are substantially and consistently more Republican and more conservative than mainline Protestants regardless of the measurement strategy. For example, evangelicals are 18 points more likely than white mainline Protestants to say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Party under the self-identification approach, and they are 17 points more likely than mainline Protestants to say they favor the GOP when the denominational strategy is used.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. CNN reporter chose to debate President Trump about the migrant caravan at the news conference. Howard Kurtz provides insight on 'Special Report.' There was no talk of a thumpin’ or a shellacking, as when George W. Bush or Barack Obama lost Congress. No, Donald Trump says an election in which his party lost the House was actually a good night. It was “such a very Big Win,” he tweeted, “and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!” And: “To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!” It’s not fake when news organizations offer a different election analysis. But the press corps didn’t help itself Wednesday with behavior that sometimes bordered on obnoxious. There are a number of things that the president can say about the midterms. He helped the Republicans increase their margin in the Senate, and undoubtedly helped individual Senate and gubernatorial candidates. By nationalizing the election, he might have blunted what could have been a Democratic wave — say, winning 40-plus seats instead of at least 27 — in the House. At a combative news conference Wednesday, Trump said that what happened at the polls Tuesday was “very close to a complete victory” — despite counter-campaigning by Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. By ending one-party government in Washington, I think it’s fair to say that voters wanted to put a check and balance on the Trump presidency, but not deliver a repudiation. At the same time, the outcome might have been different were the Republicans not blessed with such a favorable Senate map. There was some obvious partisanship in the media coverage. The lead story in National Review was “Republicans Hold the Senate,” though that rather predictable outcome is less important than Dems flipping the House. (A later update made the site’s lead “Split Decision.”) The Huffington Post posted this: “U.S. Election Rules Doomed Democrats’ Chances of Taking the Senate.” It seems that “the disproportionate representation of small states is part of the body’s original design. But that advantage, which benefits white voters, has become more lopsided than the framers of the Constitution likely ever imagined.” So they’re back to saying states like North Dakota and Montana shouldn’t have two senators. I’ll leave it to readers to decide whether the New York Times' lead news story was tilted in a certain direction: The outcome was a “forceful rebuke” of Trump, and voters in urban and suburban districts “have recoiled from the president’s demagoguery on race. ... “What was effectively a referendum on Mr. Trump’s incendiary conduct and hard-right nationalism may make some of the party’s lawmakers uneasy about linking themselves to a president who ended the campaign showering audiences with a blizzard of mistruths, conspiracy theories and invective about immigrants.” By contrast, Dan Balz, the Washington Post’s dean of political reporters, found there was a red wall: “All year long, Democrats talked optimistically about a blue wave that they believed was building around the country, one powerful enough to flip control of the House and even, against the odds, put the Senate in play as well. But a somewhat different reality began to set in early in the evening as the familiar contours of red and blue America powerfully reasserted themselves.” Those who say nothing really changes now for the president are just engaging in spin. But what happens next is a more complicated question than it might seem. Trump, a former Democrat, could of course choose to find some common ground with Nancy Pelosi, who may want to demonstrate that her party can help govern rather than just attack the president. In fact, he gave the once-and-future-speaker a shout-out: “I give her a great deal of credit for what she’s done and what she’s accomplished.” Trump said he’ll now have “a much easier path” than if the GOP had held the House by a couple of seats, because Democrats will come to him with plans “and we’ll negotiate it. ... It really could be a beautiful, bipartisan type of situation,” and “much less gridlock.” Perhaps. We’ll have to see what happens, as POTUS likes to say. And if there’s a total impasse, Trump said, “government comes to a halt and I would blame them.” Nor was it a good sign when Trump tweeted that if the Democrats “think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigate us,” then “we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!” Finally, Trump’s complaints about the media came into sharp relief when he called on his nemesis, Jim Acosta. CNN’s White House correspondent debated the president about the caravan — “It was not an invasion” — and questioned whether Trump was demonizing immigrants. After a couple of exchanges, Acosta tried to ask another question. Trump said he was moving on, and the reporter actually refused to give up the microphone when an aide tried to take it. “That’s enough, put down the mic,” Trump said. “I tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person, you shouldn’t be working for CNN. You’re a very rude person, the way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.” When Trump called on NBC’s Peter Alexander, who defended Acosta -- “I’m not a big fan of yours, either,” the president said — Acosta yelled a question about pipe bombs. “When you report fake news,” Trump said, “you are the enemy of the people.” Acosta seems to resort to grandstanding and interruption in most of his interactions with Trump. And the White House late yesterday temporarily suspended his credentials, claiming he had been "placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern." This was the aide asked to take his mike, and there was only incidental physical contact. The administration would have had a stronger case saying Acosta wasn't following the rules. By yanking his hard pass, the Trump team shifted the spotlight back to its treatment of the press and turned Acosta into a journalistic martyr.

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60 WASHINGTON – Retired four-star Admiral William McRaven – the leader of the operation that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden – fired back after President Donald Trump dismissed him as a "Hillary Clinton fan" and an "Obama-backer" in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday. Trump made the comment during an exchange with "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace about the president's labeling of the news media – or at least the media he doesn't like – of being the "enemy of the American people." Wallace brought up McRaven's assertion that Trump's attitude toward the media constitutes "perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime." "Hillary Clinton fan," Trump said, interrupting Wallace the moment the Fox News host mentioned McRaven. "Excuse me, Hillary Clinton fan," the president repeated, as Wallace tried to continue. " ... who led the operations, commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden, says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime," Wallace said. More: Fox News host Chris Wallace tells Trump world sees him as ‘beacon for repression’ "OK, he’s a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama-backer and frankly ... " Trump replied. "He was a Navy SEAL 37 years," Wallace interjected. Trump then pondered how "nice" it would have been "if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner" and implied finding him in Pakistan should have been easy. Former acting CIA director Michael Morrell said on Twitter that there was a "correction needed" in Trump's insinuation that McRaven should have found bin Laden sooner. He said it was the CIA that did the "finding" while McRaven's team did the "getting.' Correction needed to POTUS’s comment today that McRaven should have found bin Laden sooner. CIA did the “finding.” McRaven’s special operators did the “getting.” They moved within days of President Obama giving the order. https://t.co/7e79sDpENH "I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else," McRaven said in a statement to CNN on Sunday in response to Trump's comments. "I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for." McRaven said he admires all presidents, "regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the Nation together in challenging times." "I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime. When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression, then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands." Via @jaketapper, Ret. Admiral William McRaven's response to Trump: "I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime." pic.twitter.com/iubTvPEdwp McRaven, who recently stepped down as chancellor of the University of Texas system, first made his comment about Trump's threat to democracy while speaking with journalism students in February 2017. He then wrote about the exchange in a blog post. The retired admiral also went after Trump in an August letter published in The Washington Post for revoking former CIA director John Brennan's security clearance. "I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency," he wrote. "Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation." Without naming McRaven, Trump on Monday repeated his assertion that bin Laden should have been captured sooner, amid cable news reports that characterized his comments as mocking McRaven and the U.S. military. Trump added that bin Laden was on his radar before the 9/11 attacks. He blamed Bill Clinton for missing “his shot” at bin Laden, an apparent reference to a 1998 cruise missile strike launched by the Clinton administration in response to the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa that same year. The strike missed bin Laden by several hours. "Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center," Trump tweeted. "President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!" Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!.. In a follow up post on Twitter, Trump wrote that the U.S. no longer pays Pakistan billions "because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another." McRaven served 37 years in the Navy before retiring in 2014. A former SEAL and special forces commander, McRaven led the 2011 operation that killed bin Laden in Pakistan. And he ran the task force that hunted down former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003. Trump has had a contentious relationship with the news media since he announced his candidacy in 2015. He began to refer to coverage he disliked as "fake news" after the 2016 election – co-opting a term that had previously been applied to overtly false social media stories disguised as news. After taking office, he upped the ante, labeling media outlets he disliked the "enemy of the American people." This month, the Trump administration revoked the press credentials for CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after a heated exchange between Acosta and the president at a White House news conference. On Friday a federal judge ordered Acosta's credential be returned. More: Why a retired Navy SEAL commander wants Trump to revoke his security clearance Contributing: John Fritze

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Former Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says staff changes are expected as the White House prepares to work with a divided Congress. It’s almost Thanksgiving, so we could give thanks that the election of more than a week ago is mostly over. Or perhaps we could thank the media that things are back to their new normal – journalists attacking President Trump around the clock. This week was a cornucopia of crazy. There was an MSNBC regular warning that Trump might stage a military coup if he loses the 2020 election. Then there were allegations that the president, who has several Jewish family members, is somehow anti-Semitic. Washington Post readers were also told that black women covering the president should “expect peak nasty,” although President Trump has been an equal opportunity basher of the liberal press. Politico reported a former Trump aide said the White House was ‘like an episode of ‘Maury.’” “The only thing that’s missing is a paternity test,” went the comment, which was mis-attributed on CNN. The New York Times even asked if the press should “Boycott Trump.” Ever fair, the paper interviewed Democrats who hate Trump and Republicans who mostly hate Trump. That list included “former Republican presidential strategist” Steve Schmidt, who despises Republicans so much he’s called them "kook," "nut ball," "crook" and "weirdo" just this year. That’s how the Times serves neutrality. MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch was the one cooking up Trump conspiracies about 2020. Deutsch’s bizarre forecast for the future, in the “sad event” the president does run again, is that Trump could toss out the Constitution is he loses the 2020 presidential election. “He (Trump) would be a president going, ‘I’m not leaving. I’m not leaving. Call the military.’ We have to look at this man. He really would do that,” Deutsch told the “Morning Joe” audience. News organizations filled their sites with overdone hate. “Trump Is Worse Than Nixon,” went one New York Times op-ed. “Conservative” Washington Post columnist Max Boot blasted Trump, saying, “America will need years to clean up the toxins Trump has released.” The GOP was accused of “dancing with autocracy” (Trump) in another Post op-ed. Hollywood served up some turkeys of its own. Sometime-comedian Sarah Silverman called Trump a “douche bag” and made a Nazi reference to her being “very lucky that I get a star” on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and didn’t “have to sew it on my clothes.” Even actor Robert De Niro reheated a version of one of his favorite lines to bash the president. De Niro used the Tony Awards stage in June to get the audience excited to hate when he said: “I’m going to say one thing, f--- Trump!” This time the venue was the Friars Club, and the actor was complaining about the “jerkoff in the White House.” “Down with this motherf---er!” he declared, according to Variety. There were special words for those who chose not to participate in the hateful anti-Trump holiday. ABC’s “The View” co-host Joy Behar attacked the Country Music Awards because the program didn’t blast Trump. “My personal belief is that we are in an emergency. The democracy is at risk, and everybody should be speaking up, everybody,” she told viewers. Inexplicably, Behar claimed she would make “10 times more money than I earn” for staying neutral. She didn’t say what outlet would pay this fantasy money. She currently is in the midst of a three-year “lucrative” deal, according to The New York Post’s Page Six. 2. Democrats Win, Media Thrilled: Sometimes the perfect metaphor presents itself. CNN provided the ideal one for the media celebration of Election 2018. The network featured a bizarre Dana Bash segment about “the original Badass Woman of Washington.” None other than return of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The network posted a clip of the segment that begins with Pelosi walking in slow motion, like “Wonder Woman.” Just in case you thought Bash might be neutral, here’s how she led off. “Nancy Pelosi certain knows her power more than any other woman I’ve ever covered in politics. And I’ve always wondered how.” I bet CNN execs think this was an apple, not a banana. MSNBC was also singing Pelosi’s praises. “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough called her ‘like one of the most competent Speakers of the House” and compared getting rid of her to getting rid of a World Series star. The news channel got even stranger. MSNBC political analyst Zerlina Maxwell continued a recent liberal theme of complaining about how elections are run in the U.S. She followed the lead of former first lady Michelle Obama and criticized how the Electoral College had chosen Trump in 2016 and that “in and of itself is misogynistic and sexist.” Over at NBC, it was “wow” time. White House Correspondent Kristen Welker used the term “wow” twice in her report. Of course, this was easy to do after the media downplayed new Arizona Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema’s liberal record and her history of bashing the state she just ran in. Sinema’s win was one of the last races called, but the tallies continued elsewhere. The New York Times whined that the GOP was trying “to Discredit (the) Recount.” The paper called that “a cold political calculation: Treat the recount as the next phase of a campaign to secure the party’s majority and agenda in the Senate.” The article went on to blame the GOP entirely for questioning the tally. It also quoted “Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore’s presidential campaign in 2000” complaining about the “obvious racial undertones in the Republican attacks on the recount process.” The article failed to note how Brazile herself isn’t even sorry for trying to fix one of the 2016 presidential debates. 3. Suddenly Avenatti Isn’t Big News: Remember when anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti was big news? It should be hard to forget. He was the legal brains behind porn star Stormy Daniels and her lawsuit against President Trump. The media adored him. By mid-June he had already done 82 CNN interviews as part of his then-173 appearances. Joy Behar on “The View” called him “the only person Donald Trump fears more than Robert Mueller.” CNN’s Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter treated him as someone he was taking “seriously as a contender” for the 2020 presidential nomination. That was just in September. Then the Senate hearing on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court happened and Avenatti was widely credited with hurting the Democrat attack. After that, the media gave him the cold shoulder and downplayed all of the negative news – such as when Daniels’ defamation suit was tossed out or possible investigation into the Kavanaugh accuser Avenatti represented. That meant it was only logical for journalists to limit how much they were willing to report on domestic violence accusations that led to Avenatti’s arrest Wednesday. Two key morning shows – CNN’s “New Day” and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” – spent just 67 seconds of their six hours Thursday to cover the arrest. That’s 0.3 percent of the time they had. Hmmmm.

---split---24.0---split---http://www.rollcall.com---split---16 Pelosi Opponents Sign Letter Saying They Won't Vote For Her for Speaker Black Voters Propelled Blue Wave, Study Finds Latest News Goodbye Midterm Dynamic, Hello Presidential Politics Democratic Senators Sue Trump Over Whitaker Appointment Buck Stops Here? Not So Much for President Trump Politics Diana DeGette Drops Out of Whip Race, Clears Way for Clyburn Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette has dropped out of the race for majority whip, leaving South Carolina Rep. James E. Clyburn running unopposed to retain his No. 3 position in Democratic leadership. “Many of my supporters have expressed concern about pressure they are receiving to return the three senior leaders to their posts without opposition,” DeGette said in a statement. “We have enough work to do without this internal pressure. Therefore, I am withdrawing my bid for Whip at this time.” DeGette had formally announced her bid for whip Nov. 7, after the midterm elections, but she said she had been talking to colleagues about her interest in the position for the better part of a year. But her entry into the race still surprised and upset members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were backing Clyburn, especially since he was the only one of the top three longtime Democratic leaders to get a challenger. “I just find it interesting and insulting at the same time that he’s the one with opposition,” CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond said last week. The Louisiana Democrat said he had been getting calls from Civil Rights leaders who were upset about DeGette’s challenge to Clyburn, the highest ranking black member of Congress. Clyburn said he had received such calls as well but noted he did not believe that DeGette was running against him for racial reasons. He had a conversation with her on the floor early last week in which he said they discussed ensuring the race remained civil. DeGette said when she decided to run she had thought Clyburn would be running for a higher position and so initially did not think she would be challenging him. Once it became clear he was running for whip, she said she stayed in the race because she thought she was qualified for the job and had garnered enough support that she thought she had a shot at winning. Richmond pushed back on DeGette’s assertion that she didn’t know Clyburn would run for whip, saying he made that clear to her in a conversation they had on the floor in September. “I told her specifically … that if the leadership stays the way it is, Clyburn is going to run for whip,” he said. “She said, ‘do you really think that’s the case.’ I said yes.” DeGette said in her statement that she looks forward to continuing on as a chief deputy whip, an appointed role. Since the whip gets to pick his deputies, it would ultimately would be up to Clyburn to allow her to remain in that role. House Democrats are scheduled to hold their leadership elections on Nov. 28.

Pelosi’s Is Anything But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in her bumpy bid to reclaim the speaker’s gavel, has wooed endorsements from more than two dozen outside groups and labor unions, an atypical element of a debate usually held within the party’s inner sanctum. The public show of support for the California Democrat makes clear the high stakes of the leadership slate for the incoming House majority and for the party’s off-the-Hill allies. MoveOn.org weighed in on Pelosi’s behalf on Thursday evening, as other progressive and liberal-leaning groups say privately their leaders are considering taking the unprecedented step of making an endorsement in a leadership contest. “We can think of no one better suited to be speaker at this critical moment in history,” wrote a group of union leaders — including from the American Federation of Government Employees, United Auto Workers and the National Association of Letter Carriers — in a letter to Pelosi after the election. “We stand ready to work with you and the entire Congress on behalf of the tens of millions of working men and women and their families who are looking to us, and to you, to address their critical concerns.” MoveOn.org, in the group’s mobilization on behalf of Pelosi’s bid, tweeted Thursday: “We strongly support and call on all members of the Democratic caucus to support @NancyPelosi for Speaker. Were it not for her skilled and effective leadership, the [Affordable Care Act] would not be law today. Dems must reject attempts to defeat her and move caucus to the right.” Pelosi, the first-ever woman to serve as speaker, held that gavel from 2007 through 2010 and her signature legislative achievements included the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare, as well as a lobbying overhaul in 2007 that she championed after Democrats won the House, in part, in the 2006 elections by attacking Republicans for a “culture of corruption” on the heels of the Jack Abramoff scandal. Some of her colleagues, such as Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, argue that the party should elect new leadership in the 116th Congress, but they have not publicly coalesced around a specific alternative to Pelosi. Other groups that have made public their preference for Pelosi include the abortion-rights organization NARAL Pro-Choice America, the League of Conservation Voters, People for the American Way, the health care-focused Protect Our Care, the Service Employees International Union, campaign finance overhaul group End Citizens United, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the United Farm Workers and the Communications Workers of America. Tax March, a liberal effort that opposed the 2017 Republican tax overhaul and also advocates for the public disclosure of the president’s tax returns, also endorsed Pelosi. “For two years, Leader Pelosi worked alongside Tax March in this fight — crisscrossing the country to educate constituents at town halls, mobilizing activists and organizers on the ground, and holding Republicans accountable for their shameful tax law,” said the group’s executive director, Maura Quint. The leaders of some of the nation’s most prominent liberal organizations and unions have also personally backed Pelosi, including Shannon Watts, founder of the gun-control organization Moms Demand Action and AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka. “I’m looking forward to calling her Madam Speaker again,” Watts tweeted recently. Though the Center for American Progress does not make endorsements in congressional leadership races, according to a spokeswoman for the organization, the group’s president Neera Tanden personally backed Pelosi for the post. Some organizations on the left, however, are urging progressive Democrats to withhold their speaker votes as a way to “extract concessions,” said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a group that backed primary challengers such as Reps.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts. “We also want any potential speaker to build a movement around the policies that the overwhelming majority of Democrats agree with: Medicare For All, rejecting corporate donations, free college, and dismantling mass incarceration and mass deportation,” Shahid said in an email. A longtime Democratic operative, who would only discuss the gavel campaign on condition of anonymity for fear of drawing the ire of Pelosi or other party members, said that the unusual outreach by progressive organizations shows both the former speaker’s influence among the outside groups and that she hasn’t yet sealed her success despite her public pronouncements that she will be speaker in the 116th Congress. In addition to the outside groups, Pelosi’s campaign team sent an email to supporters Thursday asking the public to sign on to an online campaign in support of her bid. “Let Nancy know you’ve got her back. Add your name,” the petition, at pelosiforcongress.org, reads. “If she had it locked up, she wouldn’t be doing all this,” the longtime Democratic operative said. A spokesman for Pelosi did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the role of the outside groups in her speaker campaign. Still, it’s unclear whether the show of support from outside activists for Pelosi will make a difference — and should she fail to take the gavel whether they’d experience obstacles in building ties to whomever does become speaker. Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, an Ohio Democrat considering a challenge to Pelosi, said she, too, is hearing from outside interests on her side, if only privately. “I can’t even sleep my phone is going off so much, not just from people within this institution but people outside of this institution who are excited about the possibility of change and new leadership,” Fudge said. “I mean, I’m hearing it from lobbyists, from labor, from tons and tons of people.” Even with the unusual volume of support from liberal groups for Pelosi, corporate organizations have yet to break their tradition of staying out of leadership fights. Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, “no, we do not weigh in on leadership elections.” And prominent lobbyists for business interests said their clients were not speaking out on the matter. Pelosi is still the front-runner for the job, despite facing vocal opposition from a collection of her colleagues as well as pledges from newly elected Democrats who vowed not to vote for her as Speaker. Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for the conservative group FreedomWorks, said his group has no regrets about backing Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan to lead House Republicans in the next Congress, even though Jordan lost to California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who is the current No. 2 in House GOP leadership. “It’s a matter of taking a stand on principle,” Pye said, adding that he expects Pelosi will ultimately pull it off. Given the swell of outside groups coming to her side, though, “that tells me maybe this isn’t set in stone,” he added. Lindsey McPherson contributed to this report.

Democrats Who Ran Anti-Pelosi Campaigns Show Signs of Cracking Nevada is a ‘Blue State’ Thanks to Harry Reid, Democrats Say  Watch: Jackie Speier Hears Newly Uncovered Jonestown Tape For the First Time Forty years ago Sunday, a young Jackie Speier was shot and left for dead on an airstrip in Guyana, after helping her boss — Rep. Leo Ryan — rescue 25 cult members from a deadly cult commune known as Jonestown. Ryan was shot and killed that day, shortly before more than 900 members of the commune died of a mass suicide and murder. Speier, who has been a member of Congress from California since 2008, joined Roll Call to listen to recently uncovered audio of an interview her former boss conducted with a cult escapee, just months before Ryan was killed in the so-called Jonestown massacre.

Now He Wants His Criminal Justice Bill Todd Young Elected to Lead Senate Republican Campaign Arm Policy Senate Human Rights Caucus Lauds Mike Pence for Pressuring Aung San Suu Kyi Vice President Mike Pence is getting bipartisan backing for pressing Aung San Suu Kyi over the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar. Pence met with the state counsellor of the country, also known as Burma, in connection with his trip to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, which has taken him countries across Asia, as well as Australia. “As co-chairs of the Senate Human Rights Caucus, we have repeatedly condemned the persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma’s Rakhine State and called on the Government of Burma to release Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,” said Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Chris Coons, D-Del. “We applaud Vice President Pence for affirming the United States’ commitment to a free and independent press and delivering a strong criticism of the treatment of the Rohingya during his meeting with Burmese State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi at the ASEAN Summit on Wednesday.” The senators continued: “The Government of Burma should take immediate steps to improve conditions for the Rohingya and other ethnic and religious minorities in Burma, including providing a pathway to citizenship for the Rohingya.” Tillis and Coons expressed a commitment to assist displaced Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh. The development of democracy in Myanmar has been among the most-watched developments in foreign policy in the Senate. That’s largely because of the long time interest in the country coming from current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Senior administration officials told reporters traveling with Pence that the vice president specifically asked Suu Kyi to pardon the Reuters journalists, apparently going even beyond what he had said to Suu Kyi in public. At the top of the Wednesday meeting with Suu Kyi, Pence said, “Let me also say that, in America, we believe in our democratic institutions and ideals, including a free and independent press. And the arrest and jailing of two journalists last fall was deeply troubling to millions of Americans, and I look forward to speaking with you about the premium that we place on a free and independent press.” “Let me urge all our nations to do more to address the plight of the Rohingya. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled their homeland because of the slaughter and persecution by Myanmar’s security forces and vigilantes. This is a humanitarian crisis, but we must also beware the potential radicalization of refugees,” Pence also said this week at an East Asia Summit Plenary Session in Singapore.

Politics Democrats’ Draft House Rules Would Return Some Regular Order Democrats’ draft proposals for overhauling the House rules would return at least some so-called regular order processes to the lower chamber by ensuring major bills go through committee before hitting the floor. The requirement that all bills being brought to the floor under a rule must have gone through a committee hearing and markup is just one of several notable changes Democrats are floating to House rules now that they’ll be in the majority. Incoming Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern presented the draft proposals, a list of which was obtained by Roll Call, to the Democratic Caucus Thursday afternoon. Some of the notable proposals include:  One proposal not included on the list is a restoration of earmarks. Since the 2010 earmark ban Republicans implemented was included only in their intraparty rules, Democrats technically do not need to use the rules package to restore them. They can just start using them again. However, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who’s expected to be majority leader next Congress, has suggested that language be added to the rules package outlining the parameters under which earmarks could be used and providing guidelines for ensuring they are transparent.

Politics Ruben Kihuen Harassed Women, Ethics Committee Finds Rep. Ruben Kihuen harassed women who worked with him and violated the House’s official code of conduct, according to a House Ethics Committee report released Thursday. “Kihuen made persistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities,” the report says. The advances included kissing, grabbing and comments about underwear. The release comes after a nine-month inquiry by an investigative subcommittee empaneled in Dec. 2017. The Nevada Democrat refused to resign following allegations of harassment by women who worked for and with him, even after top Democrats called on him to step down. But Kihuen decided not to seek re-election, making the announcement a day after the Ethics Committee launched its investigation. At the time, he disputed the allegations against him, but said they “would be a distraction from a fair and thorough discussion of the issues in a re-election campaign.” Three women testified before the investigative subcommittee that Kihuen made unwanted physical and verbal advances toward them between 2013 and 2017. The report details Kihuen’s actions toward a D.C. “firm employee,” a campaign staffer and a Nevada lobbyist. The committee found that while serving as a member of the House, Kihuen repeatedly kissed the firm employee’s cheek, touched her shoulders and back and commented on her physique. He also inquired about her relationship status and asked if she lived alone. Kihuen insinuated that he would help the D.C. firm employee with her career in exchange for a romantic relationship, according to the Ethics report. The campaign staffer testified that Kihuen made unwanted advances toward her by touching her thigh while they were driving back from a meeting and by grabbing the back of her thigh as she stood up to check her computer. She told the committee that Kihuen would tell her “you look really good,” and “I would take you out if you didn’t work for me,” by suggesting that the two of them should get a room as they arrived at a hotel for a meeting, and by asking her if she ever cheated on her boyfriend. The female lobbyist, who worked with Kihuen in Nevada between 2013 and 2015, testified that he slid his hand under her dress and onto her thigh, grabbed her buttocks, asked her to sit on his lap, inquired what color her panties were and suggested that she would look good naked. The report also says the lobbyist testified that he sent messages suggesting — through emojis — that they make a sex tape together.  The subcommittee’s full report includes over 100 pages of text messages, chats and emails between Kihuen and the women, along with the women discussing Kihuen’s behavior with other people. While the investigative subcommittee chose not to “address whether any of Representative Kihuen’s behavior prior to being sworn in as a Member of the House” fell within the panel’s jurisdiction, the full House Ethics Committee asserted in the report that it has jurisdiction over “misconduct relating to a successful campaign for election to the House.” The full Ethics panel decided that Kihuen’s behavior toward the campaign staffer, coupled with his actions when he was serving in the House, warrants “reproval.” Reproval by the Ethics Committee is “intended to be a clear public statement of rebuke of a Member’s conduct issued by a body of that Member’s peers acting … on behalf of the House of Representatives.” House Rule XXIII, clauses 1 and 2, states that “a Member … of the House shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House” and “shall adhere to the spirit and the letter of the Rules of the House.” Roll Call Reporters Discuss Covering Sexual Harassment on the Hill in the #MeToo Era  Politics Photos of the Week: Lame Duck, New Member Orientation and Official Class Photos The midterms have come and gone and it’s back to the Hill for members new and old.

Politics Ethics Committee Finds Mark Meadows in Violation of House Rules The House Ethics Committee found Rep. Mark Meadows failed to take “prompt and decisive action” to handle alleged sexual harassment in his congressional office, according to a Friday report. The committee also found Meadows violated House rules by failing to take action to ensure his office was not engaging in discrimination. The House Ethics Committee is requiring Meadows to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the amount paid to a Meadows staffer who was removed from his role due to allegations of harassment, $40,625.02. A group of employees in Meadows’ Washington office reported in October 2014 to the deputy chief of staff at the time that Kenny West had acted inappropriately toward them. Meadows continued to pay West his full-time salary after he was moved to a part-time advisory role. The Code of Official Conduct for House members says that members may not “retain an employee who does not perform duties for the employing office commensurate with the compensation the employee receives.” The Ethics Committee found that when West was demoted to senior adviser, his pay remained the same. The report says that the committee found “little evidence of official work that he completed during that time.” “To cut off all contact between Mr. West and most of his female employees, caused another potential problem. An environment where only male staff have access to the Chief of Staff risks unequal treatment of employees based solely on sex,” the report said. The committee found that Meadows did not know about West’s behavior until several of his female staff made complaints to him in Oct. 2014. Meadows arranged for an independent investigation through the Office of House Employment Counsel, or the Office of Compliance. “After that independent review was complete, he ignored its findings and the recommendation by the independent investigator to terminate Mr. West’s employment,” according to the Ethics Committee report. “While Representative Meadows took some important immediate steps – restricting Mr. West from the congressional offices and prohibiting him from contacting most of the female employees – those steps were essentially all he did to prevent and correct the alleged sexual harassment for nearly six months,” says the report. Meadows was approached by GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, who told him that the measures he took to separate West from the female staff were not working. The speaker’s office got involved in the spring of 2015, which prompted Meadows to remove West from his supervisory role. “There is no place in any congressional office for looking up skirts, or down shirts; staring at a woman’s chest; unwanted touching; or making sexual comments, even if subtle or in jest. The fact that Mr. West supervised the women he did these things to makes his behavior even more unacceptable,” says the report. “Making sure my team feels safe and secure in our office is the highest priority for me and I’m truly sorry for any stress this situation caused them. I thank the Ethics Committee for their work in resolving this, and my office will remain committed to serving western North Carolinians every day to the best of our ability,” said Meadows in a statement Friday afternoon. Meadows intends to pay back the severance as the committee requested, according to an aide. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Congress Relatively Mum on Raging California Camp Fire Mike Johnson Elected Next Republican Study Committee Chairman Budget Overhaul Panel Can’t Pull It Together in Time for Thanksgiving Trump and Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown — Strange Company on Climate Change? Why Nancy Pelosi Won't Back Down There’s Some WTF in This Lame Duck Session of Congress Politics Suicide Nooses in Cells Prompt ICE Query From Elizabeth Warren, Democrats A group of Senate Democrats want the private prison industry to explain whether it is complying with federal standards for housing at ICE immigration detention centers. Led by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the senators have written to CoreCivic and GEO group about their housing practices following reports from the inspector general at the Homeland Security Department. “These reports and the results of the OIG investigations indicate that the perverse profit incentive at the core of the private prison business model has resulted in GEO Group and CoreCivic boosting profits by cutting costs on expenditures including food, health care, and sufficient pay and training for guards and prison staff,” the senators wrote. The senators want answers by the end of the month. The signatories on Warren’s letters included a bunch of other potential 2020 presidential hopefuls such as Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Among the requests are for the prison operators to turn over any waivers that may have been granted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for noncompliance with relevant standards. “In their review, OIG found that detainees in immigration detention facilities do not have access to basic necessities or prompt and adequate medical care,” the senators wrote. Specifically, they cite a report about disturbing findings on the frequency of suicide attempts at a GEO Group-operated ICE facility in Adelanto, California. “The report found that in 15 out of approximately 20 cells examined inspectors saw nooses fashioned from twisted bedsheets hanging from vents,” they said. “A detainee quoted in the report explained that detainees use braided bedsheets to attempt to commit suicide.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics New GOP Leaders Stick With Trump Despite Midterm Losses The new House GOP leadership team gave no indication Wednesday it would reconsider its cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, despite losses in dozens of suburban districts in the midterms last week. Newly elected House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California acknowledged at a press conference Wednesday that winning back the American suburbs will be a “challenge” in 2020 but said multiple times at the press conference that “history was against” the GOP keeping control of both chambers of Congress in a midterm election with a first-term Republican president in the Oval Office. McCarthy declined to assign blame for any midterm losses to the president and his bombastic immigration-centric rhetoric. Instead, he attributed Democratic gains to millions of dollars in outside spending from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others. The new House GOP standard-bearer, who will serve out the lame duck session as majority leader, indicated Republicans would actively protect Trump by countering Democratic efforts to execute oversight over the Trump administration. Democrats want to “disrupt” and “impeach,” McCarthy said. Democratic leaders and prospective House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler have not suggested at any point before or since the midterms that they plan to pursue articles of impeachment. Nadler and Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings have, however, already made clear that their top priority will be to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election — including possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. Democrats have a laundry list of other matters they want to investigate — the president’s tax returns, possible violations of the Emoluments Clause, internal administration communications that led to the immigrant family separation policy at the U.S. border — but have said they know they will need to be methodical and prioritize. The new Republican leaders panned the notion of Democratic House oversight over the administration. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who will remain the House Republican whip after a unanimous voice vote in his favor Wednesday, said “people in this country don’t want an obstructive Congress.” McCarthy agreed. “If their agenda is simply investigations and impeachment ... we’ll be there to defend the American public,” he said. McCarthy and Scalise were flanked at the press conference by new Republican conference chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who will fill the position her father held three decades ago; conference vice chairman Mark Walker of North Carolina; conference secretary Jason Smith of Missouri; and policy committee chairman Gary Palmer of Alabama, the first conservative House Freedom Caucus member to hold a leadership position. The new National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, did not attend the press conference. Walker branded the House GOP as the party of the future, noting the average age of the likely top three leaders on the Democratic side are a combined average of 78 years old. The average age of the new GOP leaders is 52. “We’re all about new ideas,” Walker said. The new leaders have not had a chance to discuss how they will extend an olive branch to the Freedom Caucus and other supporters of its founder, Jim Jordan, who lost the race for minority leader to McCarthy, 159 votes to 43. McCarthy thanked Jordan for running, suggesting it was good for members to have options to weigh for new leadership. Trump has told confidants that he wants Jordan, a fierce and skillful defender of the president on the cable news circuit, to be appointed ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee to repel possible impeachment proceedings against him, Politico reported Wednesday. That appointment does not, for now, appear likely, as Republican Reps. Steve Chabot of Ohio and Doug Collins of Georgia prepare to court steering committee votes for the post. A spot has opened up for Jordan, though, to lead Republicans in the Oversight Committee. The current GOP chairman, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, is retiring in January. “I think Jim is an incredibly talented guy,” Palmer said. “I think he will [be the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee] one day. He’s that talented,” Palmer said. He declined to say whether “one day” meant in the new Congress in January or further in the future.

Politics Trump Casts Himself as Pelosi’s Speaker Savior President Donald Trump on Saturday said he can twist enough House Republican arms to give Nancy Pelosi the necessary votes to become speaker. The California Democrat publicly says she has ample support within her own caucus to secure the gavel. But all indications are a floor vote could be close, meaning Republicans could opt — for a list of reasons — to put her over the top. For Trump, making Pelosi speaker would give him the sense that she owes him legislatively and also ensure that his top campaign-trail foil, who remains intensely unpopular with Republican voters, remains in the headlines through his re-election bid. [Awkward Moments from Donald Trump's Veterans Day Do-Over] “I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House,” he tweeted Saturday morning ahead of a trip to California to visit with people affected by wildfires. He again wrote that Pelosi “deserves this victory, she has earned it — but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away.” Ultimately, Trump predicted Pelosi “will win!” I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win! @TomReedCongress  He reiterated his promise to assist Pelosi as he left the White House for California, saying he could get her however many GOP votes she needs, whether it was 100 or 10. Pelosi said Thursday she intends to win the speakership with Democratic votes and would not accept help from help from Republicans. “Oh please, no,” she said. “Never. Never. Never.” Trump told reporters Saturday that his legal team would submit written answers to questions posed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “They’re all done,” he said of his responses, which he claimed Friday to have written himself. He also said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief him on Air Force One about the agency’s findings about whether Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump again said he has been told the crown prince was not involved in the assassination, despite reports the CIA has concluded the de facto Saudi ruler gave the green-light to lure Khashoggi to Turkey and then kill him. Asked about a New York Times report that he is concerned over Vice President Mike Pence’s loyalty, Trump replied: “No, I don’t question his loyalty at all. … It was a phony story. I doubt they had any sources. … He’s been a trooper.” “Mike Pence is 100 percent,” the president said several times. Trump said he is not close to picking a nominee for attorney general, but is close to announcing a UN ambassador pick.

Politics House Republicans to Consider Changing the Way They Select Committee Leaders House Republicans on Thursday will consider changes to their internal conference rules, with several amendments targeting the process for selecting committee leaders. The biggest proposed change comes from Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher, who wants committee members to be able to choose their own chairmen or ranking members. His amendment would exclude the Rules, Budget and House Administration committees — the heads of which are appointed by the Republican leader — from the member-selection process. Under the conference’s current rules, the Republican Steering Committee, a panel composed primarily of leadership and regional representatives, nominates committee leaders and the full conference ratifies those recommendations. If Gallagher’s amendment were adopted, the Steering Committee would still be in charge of assigning members to committees. Also Watch: Senate Republicans Talk Leadership Team and Special Counsel Protections House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, who’s a proponent of allowing committee members to select their leaders, has an alternative amendment should Gallagher’s fail. Meadows’ proposal would at least reduce leadership’s influence in selecting committee leaders. The North Carolina Republican wants to get rid of an existing rule that would allow the Republican leader’s vote to count as four votes and his deputy’s to count as two votes, so that their combined votes are equal to all other Steering members’ votes. Meadows also has two other amendments. One would strike an existing rule that allows members who are appointed to the Rules Committee to reserve their seniority on one standing committee they had to leave to join Rules. The other would ensure that if the GOP leader convenes a panel to consider conference rules changes, the members he appoints would be “broadly representative of the diverse perspectives within the Republican Conference.” Texas Rep. Pete Olson is offering an amendment to prevent committee leaders who reach their three-term limit (an existing conference rule that no one is proposing to change) from leading any of that panel’s subcommittees during the following three Congresses. Many Republican committee leaders often retire from Congress after reaching their term limits, as five of them did for that reason this cycle. (Three chairmen who were not term-limited retired too). But Olson’s amendment would likely force even more into that decision and thus seems unlikely to be adopted. Olson does provide a grandfather clause in his amendment that would allow any former committee leader who held subcommittee chairmanships this Congress to continue on in those roles for up to two more terms. In amendment that is blatantly self-serving, Alaska Rep. Don Young is offering an amendment to allow the dean of the House to serve on the Republican Steering Committee when the dean is a GOP member. Young is the dean, the title ascribed to the longest-serving House member. The final amendment comes from New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and would require members of elected leadership who decide to run for higher office like governor or senator to vacate their leadership positions after announcing. It's unclear whether Stefanik’s amendment is meant to target a member of the leadership team the conference elected Wednesday. But it could seen as an insurance policy against Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney — who was elected conference chairwoman for the next Congress — using the leadership post as a platform to run against Sen. Michael B. Enzi for his Senate seat again. Enzi is up for re-election in 2020. Cheney challenged him when he last ran in 2014 — she was not in Congress at the time — but ultimately dropped out of the race, citing family health issues. Noticeably absent from the amendment offerings were controversial ones that arose two years ago over restoring earmarks. At the time House Republicans, who banned earmarks after they won the House majority in 2010, appeared poised to provide a limited restoration of what proponents like to call congressional directed spending. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan urged the members to drop the proposal for further debate, promising a vote in the following months that never happened. The reason GOP earmark proponents aren’t offering new amendments this year is likely because they’re not in the majority so wouldn’t have much power on their own to use them anyway. Plus, Democrats seem likely to lift the earmark ban as part of the House rules package for the 116th Congress. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics Florida Senate Race Advances to Hand Recount Florida’s Senate race is proceeding from a machine recount to a hand recount, the Secretary of State announced Thursday. It’s the latest development in the drawn-out race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, whose margin remains under the 0.25 of a percentage point that automatically triggers a hand recount. Canvassing boards in each county will have three days to examine “overvotes” and “undervotes” to try to determine how voters intended to vote. Overvotes are when the machine detects too many votes for the same office, and undervotes are when the machines don’t pick up any vote for a particular office. A Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times estimate found there could be anywhere between 35,000 and 118,000 of these ballots. Democrats are seeking a hand recount of all ballots in Palm Beach County because of problems with the county's vote-counting machines. Scott’s campaign claims that his lead grew by 865 votes during the machine recount. That would make his margin about 13,400 votes, according to his campaign. Nelson’s campaign believes the margin remains around 12,600. Scott’s campaign, which has made multiple unfounded allegations of voter fraud in the week since Election Day, is calling on Florida to “move forward.” But Nelson’s campaign remains optimistic about its chances to win the race and believes more votes need to be counted. “It has never been our position that there was going to be one silver bullet that would change the margin in this race,” Nelson recount attorney Marc Elias said on a call with reporters Thursday evening. Besides the hand recount, Elias believes Nelson can pick up votes from voters “curing” what’s known as signature mismatches. That refers to mail-in or provisional ballots that were rejected because the signatures on them did not match the signatures state officials had on record. A district court on Thursday extended the deadline for voters who were belatedly notified of a signature irregularity to correct their signatures on those ballots. Elias also sees opportunity for Nelson to pick up votes from a pending lawsuit that would allow the counting of mail-in ballots that were cast by Election Day but not delivered in time.

---split---27.0---split---https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/magazine/nancy-pelosi-house-democrats.html---split---Feature As she prepares to lead the House of Representatives again, the most powerful Democrat in Washington will have to navigate between a rampaging president and her colleagues’ plans for fighting back. Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco this month.CreditCreditNolwen Cifuentes for The New York Times Supported by By Robert Draper Four days before the election that would return the Democratic Party to a majority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi sat in a nearly empty restaurant on San Francisco’s Embarcadero late in the afternoon, drinking green tea and eating a chocolate sundae. “We have to be strategic in whatever we do,” the leader of the House Democrats said, considering the desire some in her party had to zealously investigate the Trump administration. “In terms of subpoena power, you have to handle it with care,” Pelosi continued. “Yes, on the left there is a Pound of Flesh Club, and they just want to do to them what they did to us.” She shook her head emphatically. “That’s not who we are,” she said. “Go get somebody else if that’s who you want.” Pelosi is nothing if not purposeful. The following day, rallying with Democratic candidates in a San Francisco park, she would wear an orange pantsuit, explaining to crowds that orange was “the color of gun-violence protection.” This afternoon she had booked a table at Delancey Street, a restaurant that was famous, she said, for employing ex-convicts: “Redemption,” she added emphatically, in case I might have missed the point. Pelosi told me that she and the House Democrats had every intention of working with President Trump on things like lowering prescription-drug costs, rebuilding America’s infrastructure and protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. She reminded me of her long stints on the House Appropriations and Intelligence Committees — panels on which, “left to our own devices, we could always find our way in a bipartisan manner.” There were a lot of Democrats, I suggested, who believed that bipartisanship had been rendered antique in the Trump era. “Yeah,” Pelosi replied, smirking, “and I have those who want to be for impeachment and for abolishing ICE” — Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the federal law-enforcement agency spearheading Trump’s crackdown on immigration. “Two really winning issues for us, right? In the districts we have to win? I don’t even think they’re the right thing to do. If the evidence from Mueller is compelling, it should be compelling for Republicans as well, and that may be a moment of truth. But that’s not where we are.” This was the question with which Democrats were wrestling, on the eve of their reconquest of the House and Pelosi’s expected return to House speaker, the job she held once before, from 2007 to 2011: Was Pelosi where they were? Was this genius of orderly politics equipped for the daily earthquakes brought on by Trump’s fulminations? I asked her if she had any reason to believe Trump was willing to work together in good faith. She laughed. “I don’t think he knows,” she said. “You know how I talk to him?” She put down her spoon. “I just say it in public. That’s what he hears: what people say in public. Now, President Bush: a gentleman, we have disagreements on the liberal-conservative spectrum, but it’s not — my God.” She laughed mirthlessly as she thought of Trump again. “What’s the word I could use instead of ‘grotesque’?” Pelosi shrugged wearily. “We’ll see,” she said. “We’ll have a contrast between decency and dignity and openness and bipartisanship and oneness, and whatever he decides to wake up to be that day.” But, she went on, what lay ahead was not a contest of manners, nor even of parties. In Pelosi’s view, Trump seemed bent on threatening the institutions of democracy, beginning with his attacks on the free press. “He’s trying to destroy the collective consciousness of our country.” When I half-jokingly protested that in fact Trump loved the press, Pelosi quickly replied: “May I say something you’re not going to like? I think the press loves him. All day on TV — and I don’t even watch TV, except sports. But he says somebody had a horse face — all day we hear about that. We hear about Kanye West, all day. You just give him all day! So I don’t want you to think I’m making an analogy” — the descendant of Italian immigrants then laughed, unable to resist — “but Mussolini, he didn’t care what they said about him, as long as they were talking about him.” For months, Pelosi has been openly campaigning to be the next speaker of the House should her party gain a majority in the midterm elections, as it did on Election Day. This second speakership would make her the principal counterweight to a president she unabashedly described to me as “a very dangerous man.” It would also most likely be the final act of the 78-year-old legislator’s long career as the most powerful woman in the history of American politics. In interviews, she has audaciously declared herself to be a “master legislator”; issued policy statements on behalf of the Democratic caucus; and implicitly dared any challenger to make themselves known while also quelling opposition to her speakership by hinting in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in October that she was open to being a “transitional figure.” When I asked Pelosi about this olive branch two weeks later, however, she abruptly walked it back: “I think every leader is a transitional figure.” Her torrid October schedule, spanning more than two dozen cities, involved meeting with candidates whose victories on Nov. 6 were mostly all but assured, while taking care to avoid hotly contested races where the presence of one of the least popular and most reliably demonized figures in American politics might cost a Democrat votes. Pelosi had spent the previous day in Arizona, rallying volunteers and donors on behalf of Ann Kirkpatrick — a candidate who, then seven points ahead of her Republican opponent in internal polls, didn’t really need Pelosi’s help. But Kirkpatrick had publicly stated that she would vote for Pelosi as speaker, and Pelosi was offering a display of gratitude. And no doubt when the time came for Kirkpatrick to ask for a plum committee assignment — the Appropriations Committee happened to be her first choice — the speaker would be only too happy to demonstrate what loyalty got you with Nancy Pelosi. “She is, in my view, the best speaker I’ve ever seen,” said David Obey, the cantankerous former Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who served under eight different speakers, including Pelosi, over the course of his 42-year congressional career. “She understands her caucus, and she doesn’t run it like a San Francisco liberal. She runs it by trying to find its center of gravity. She works harder than anybody I’ve ever seen, and I think she has more determination to stand for something than anybody I’ve ever dealt with.” When I asked Obey whether such skills were of any use in negotiating with a president like Trump, he acknowledged with a grunt, “Well, I think it’s damn near an impossible task for anybody to work with him. But to the extent that it’s possible, she’s the one who would have the best chance. If Trump plays that game of agreeing to something and then backing off, she has the talent to unify her caucus so that they have a unified message to take to the American people — because in cases like that, only the American people can set matters straight.” Pelosi is something of a paradox in the world of politics. A Gallup poll five months ago found her favorability rating to be at a dismal 29 percent, and yet — unlike other unpopular political figures such as Trump and Hillary Clinton — her 31 years in public life have been free of scandal. She has been excoriated from the right as the quintessence of California limousine liberalism. But she is also a practicing Catholic whose first career was as a stay-at-home mother of five children, with little in common with — and at times little patience for — the new generation of activists in her party, to whom she sometimes refers as “the lefties.” Pelosi — who with her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, owns a large house in San Francisco’s upper-crust Presidio Heights as well as a Napa Valley vineyard — is indeed rich. But 29 members of Congress, 18 of them Republicans, are richer. What sets her apart from other legislators of her stature is her gender. Pelosi has been known to say: “No one gives you power. You have to take it from them.” The leitmotif of her three-decade ascent is that of a woman wresting power away from a male-dominated political machine, until one day the machine discovered she was its master. Pelosi arrived in San Francisco in 1969 at age 29 with an advanced degree in back-room Democratic politics. Her father, Tom D’Alesandro, was a Baltimore congressman and mayor on intimate terms with the leading Democrats of his day; President Franklin Roosevelt fondly addressed him as Tommy. Pelosi moved doggedly up the California Democratic ranks: first as a fund-raiser; then as the chairwoman of the Northern California party; then, in 1982, as the first party chairwoman of a large state; then the host committee chairwoman of the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco; and a year after that, as the finance director of the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Still, when Pelosi, at 46, first ran for Congress in a 1987 special election, she was derided by the campaign of her Democratic primary opponent Harry Britt as a pampered and unserious “party girl.” And as one of only 26 women in a body of 435 members, Pelosi soon learned that, as her first chief of staff, Judy Lemons, told me: “Sexual harassment and sexual overreaching were absolutely institutionalized. It was part of the deal.” Pelosi took the system as it was. It was never her way to complain about being called a “gutsy broad” by jowly old bulls like Dan Rostenkowski, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, and stared at like a filet mignon. She established herself as a formidable fund-raiser and made still more friends upon landing a seat in 1993 on the Appropriations Committee — which, before Congress curtailed the practice, controlled the process of distributing the lucrative earmarks that members sought for their districts, constituents and benefactors. When I asked Pelosi whether Democratic leaders had ever encouraged her to rise in the ranks, she scoffed. “They didn’t ever invite me to a meeting,” she said. “The only time I was ever in the Democratic speaker’s office was when I became speaker. When I decided to run, the first thing I heard was: ‘Who said she could run?’ Oh, light my fire, why don’t you! Then they said, ‘Why don’t women just make a list of things they want done, and we’ll do them?’ We’re not talking about the 1800s — we’re talking about 19 years ago!” In 2001, Pelosi ran for minority whip. The move, like Pelosi’s determination more generally, was informed by the not-unfounded belief that if she didn’t lead the Democrats, someone else was apt to bungle the job. “What she really saw was a leadership that was marking time,” George Miller, Pelosi’s colleague in the California delegation and an ally in the whip campaign, told me. “And one thing she doesn’t do is mark time.” Pelosi’s two main opponents, the courtly Marylander Steny Hoyer and the celebrated civil rights leader John Lewis of Georgia, proved no match for her shrewd deployment of campaign donations to woo members into her camp. Years later, John Spratt, a South Carolina congressman who voted against her at the time, sheepishly told me, “I couldn’t quite see her as whip, because you need to be kind of tough to be whip, and I estimated her differently. I just didn’t put two and two together.” The speaker of the House is constitutionally the presiding officer of the lower legislative chamber and statutorily second in line to the presidency, after the vice president. But the power conferred by the office is almost entirely situational. A speaker can promulgate the majority party’s legislative agenda and frame the parameters of what takes place on the House floor. But this is no guarantee of legislative success, even when one party controls every branch of government — as the current speaker, Paul Ryan, can glumly attest. Ryan’s Republican House membership has spent its time in the majority fiercely split between those inclined to govern and those hellbent on ideological warfare. Unable to command the far right, either by reverence or by fear, and condescended to by the leader of his own party in the White House, Ryan, for much of his tenure, has been a curiously irrelevant figure. By contrast, during Nancy Pelosi’s four years as speaker, there was no confusion as to who was in control. Pelosi used the tools at her disposal — committee assignments, campaign donations — to establish a balance among her party’s coalitions while also reminding everyone that her job was not simply to officiate and appease. As one of Pelosi’s former senior staff members, describing Pelosi’s outlook, told me: “What do you call a person who’s 99 percent loyal? Disloyal. She has a long memory.” Crossing Pelosi, it was understood, came at a cost. As evidence, Democratic members had only to look at that lion of the House, Michigan’s John Dingell, who did not vote for Pelosi as whip in 2001 — after which Pelosi backed a Democratic challenger to Dingell’s seat in 2002 and later offered backstage support to her California colleague Henry Waxman when he challenged and defeated Dingell for chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in 2008. In 2006, Pelosi supported her close ally John Murtha of Pennsylvania in his doomed and divisive quest to wrest the majority-leader post away from Steny Hoyer, her chief opponent in the 2001 whip race. Jane Harman, another California representative and a respected foreign-policy specialist, was denied the House Intelligence Committee chairmanship in 2007 owing to some mysterious falling out with Pelosi. But as Newt Gingrich learned the hard way two decades ago, an autocratic speaker is a short-lived one. Pelosi’s reign was successful because she understood the will of her caucus rather than bending it to hers. “There are two sets of negotiating skills you need as speaker,” said Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who served as one of Pelosi’s most trusted lieutenants in the House from 2003 until he departed for the Senate in 2017. “There are the skills you use to bring the caucus together, and then the skills you use when you’re dealing with the other party. Your ability on the latter depends on the former. If you turn around and your troops aren’t with you, you’ve obviously lost your bargaining strength. So one of the things that’s really set Nancy Pelosi apart is her uncanny ability to unite all the different Democratic coalitions around a negotiating position. And whether it was Bush or Boehner or Ryan, they never doubted that she had the votes to back up her position.” Unifying Pelosi’s caucus has meant more than just bridging the predictable racial, geographical and ideological divisions among the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the Progressive Caucus and the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. “There’s an old saying in politics: If you don’t know your jewels, know your jeweler,” David Obey told me. “She understands what each individual member needs.” George Miller said: “When we had the tough votes to take, there were times when she’d say, ‘Just give me the names and then leave me alone.’ ” Among the toughest of tough votes, Miller said, was the Affordable Care Act. As the sweeping health care reform bill took shape in early 2009, Pelosi confronted a landscape peopled with intransigent House Republicans, reluctant Blue Dogs, liberals demanding nothing less than a single-payer system, skittish White House advisers and Senate Democrats willing to waste months in quixotic pursuit of bipartisan cover. Pelosi — who in her first floor speech in 1987 vowed to fight AIDS and who in 2002 was the most high-profile Democrat to vote against invading Iraq — fell back on the credibility she had with progressives to persuade them that the “public option” hybrid of single-payer and privately managed health care plans was now dead on arrival in the Senate. Then she persuaded Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, an anti-abortion Democrat, to drop his demand that the health care bill prohibit federal funds being used on abortion. When a host of other backstage deals with Blue Dogs — like reckoning with disparities among states in Medicare reimbursements — failed, Pelosi managed the fallout. Obamacare passed in the House by three votes. “I’d remind people: We would not have health care today were it not for Nancy Pelosi,” Obey said. “There were all kinds of people, both in our caucus and in the White House, who were willing to settle for one-tenth of a loaf. And she said, ‘To hell with that. We were sent here to do more.’ ” If Pelosi played a decisive role in the passage of Obamacare, she was also a factor in its unpopularity. Less than two weeks before it cleared the House, Pelosi acknowledged the public’s apprehensiveness about the bill by telling an audience at the National Association of Counties’s annual legislative conference, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.” Pelosi was trying to convey that the bill’s actual value would become clear to Americans once it was enacted, but her breezy explanation remains the most memorable gaffe of her political career. For all her mastery of Washington’s inside game, Pelosi has never been a deft public-facing politician. Early in her career, a close associate told me, Pelosi hired a speech coach and studied videos of herself, with no discernible improvement. An aide once gently informed her that a speech she had just given “meandered at times” — which Pelosi, who is notoriously tough on her staff, did not take well. “How was that — did I meander?” she said to the aide for weeks thereafter. Pelosi’s speaking style is less tangential than cubist, full of unexpected angles. At times, she seems to be carrying on three or four different conversations at once. Her prodigious memory can prove burdensome — everything seems to remind her of something else — and she often seeks to legitimize her assertions with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., the Constitution or some other unassailable authority. She often quotes herself too, or party slogans commissioned by her and given a focus group’s seal of approval: Six for ’06 (in 2006), Reigniting the American Dream (2011), Ladders of Opportunity (2012), A Better Deal (2017), For the People (2018). Still, Pelosi’s foremost liability is the effectiveness of the attacks against her. In 2010, Republicans spent $65 million attacking Pelosi in ads; the Republican National Committee hung a banner from its headquarters that read FIRE PELOSI. The attacks have often borne more than a tinge of sexism; in 2012, when Pelosi, as minority leader, wielded less power than the Senate’s Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, Republicans’ negative television ads were seven times as likely to mention Pelosi as Reid, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. The 2010 onslaught took its toll on Pelosi’s public standing — her favorable rating dropped into the 20s — but otherwise did not faze her. She made clear to her caucus members that they should do whatever it took to win, even if it meant publicly distancing themselves from her. “I don’t know anyone in the world with thicker skin, or anyone about whom more callous things have been said, and she just truly doesn’t care,” a former Pelosi staff member told me. “There’s a small constituency she cares about: her members.” That November, when the G.O.P. seized 63 House seats and Democrats briefly considered whether new leadership was in order, Republicans cheekily replaced the banner on the R.N.C. building with one that read HIRE PELOSI. For the next eight years as minority leader, though, Pelosi did some of her best work. She managed to keep her caucus unified, while John Boehner’s remained unruly. Some of the Tea Party freshmen who came to power in 2010 railing against the “Pelosi liberals” would, when I interviewed them several years later, confide to me that they wished their Republican leaders possessed Pelosi’s spine. Among Pelosi’s proudest feats, she told me, was keeping enough Democrats together to routinely vote against the G.O.P.’s incessant efforts to legislatively chip away at Obamacare. Even if such bills passed the House and the Senate, President Obama could veto them, and Pelosi’s magic number of 146 dissenting Democrats (just over one-third of the House’s overall membership) would be enough to sustain the president’s veto. During budget fights, House conservatives watched in astonished fury as Pelosi obtained one concession after the next — like increased spending for community health centers and freezing the number of deportation officers — even after Trump became president. It helped that the minority leader knew, far better than the Republicans, where the votes were. But her negotiating prowess was also a result of understanding legislative substance better than her counterparts did. “You have to have knowledge of the details,” she told me, casually adding, “That’s how I was able to beat them on everything.” But Pelosi’s caucus also grew restive during its years in the minority. Younger members impatient to distinguish themselves in a body of 435 saw little hope of achieving committee chairmanships; Pelosi, unlike her Republican counterparts, maintained the tradition of allotting them based on seniority. She did this out of deference to the Congressional Black Caucus, according to several former staff members, because African-American members have historically not been granted high party standing except through longevity. But between the unavailability of chairman posts and a leadership pipeline clogged with 70-somethings — Pelosi; Hoyer, the minority whip; and James Clyburn, the assistant minority leader — younger House Democrats have been left to ponder other opportunities. “You have some of the institutional members say, ‘Who are these upstarts?’ ” one of these younger Democrats, Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who was elected in 2012, told me in 2015. “One member of Congress compared us to spoiled kids, like teenagers who want a car on their 16th birthday. But you look at my class: Tulsi Gabbard, she’s not going to stay in the House for long — she’ll run for governor. Joe Kennedy, the same. Pat Murphy, the same. And they’re all talented, ambitious and good fund-raisers. I’ve just got to think that when you see that 20-year road to be in a position of consequence, other options look a lot more attractive.” O’Rourke, of course, left this year to pursue those other options, following his fellow erstwhile rising House stars Xavier Becerra (who was appointed attorney general of California in 2017) and Kyrsten Sinema (whom Arizona elected to the Senate this month). The growing unease born of being in the minority was not confined to these members, however. “She faces more division in her caucus than she ever had before,” the former Pelosi aide told me. After the disastrous 2010 midterms, Heath Shuler, a Blue Dog moderate from North Carolina, decided to run against her for minority leader. Following the devastation of the 2016 election, another centrist, Tim Ryan of Ohio, challenged her as well. Neither Shuler nor Ryan made much pretense of being a Pelosi-caliber legislative tactician. Their candidacies were more based on what they were not: not from San Francisco, not liberal. They were also not skilled vote-counters. Shuler managed to collect just 43 of the Democratic caucus’s 193 votes; six years later, Ryan took 63, to Pelosi’s 134. Still, by the time of Ryan’s challenge to Pelosi’s leadership in November 2016, several Democrats were no longer hiding their dissatisfaction — itself a sign of Pelosi’s diminished power. She responded by creating new leadership posts and appointed three young members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — to oversee a “rebranding” of the party that was more an exercise in inclusiveness than a substantive reimagination. She also began assuring members that she did not intend to stick around forever. She insisted publicly, for example, that had Hillary Clinton won, Pelosi would have felt that the Democrats no longer required her stewardship. Many doubted this claim, including former staff members with whom I spoke. Her closest political confidant, George Miller, told me that Pelosi had never made such an indication to him. Further, the minority leader’s recent assertion that it was important for her to stay so that the American public would have “a woman at the table” struck some in her caucus as disingenuous, given that Pelosi’s perceived favorites to succeed her throughout the years — Chris Van Hollen, Steve Israel of New York, Xavier Becerra and most recently Joe Crowley, who was beaten in a primary upset in New York this year by the Democratic Socialist first-time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — were all men. But, Pelosi knew, nothing would mollify her caucus like victory. In paving a road back to the majority, she returned to the playbook that worked for her last time. “The first thing we had to do in 2005 was take the president’s numbers down,” Pelosi told me, referring to Bush’s approval rating. “Bush was 57 percent in early 2005.” The moment Bush introduced the idea of partly privatizing Social Security, Pelosi’s Democrats pounced and began attacking the scheme as an assault on senior citizens. “His numbers came down to 38 in the fall,” she recalled, “and that’s when the retirements started to happen” — nervous Republican congressmen who decided to vacate their seats. Because Trump began his presidency as a polarizing force even within his own party, Pelosi said, the Democrats were best served by standing back while one fainthearted Republican House member after the next, facing variously a Trump-adoring base or a Trump-inspired anti-Republican backlash, announced their retirements — 39 House and Senate members in all. The new Democratic candidates by and large stuck to the disciplined campaign message prescribed by Pelosi’s rebranding efforts: protecting health care, advocating better jobs and wages through infrastructure improvements, restoring integrity to government. By the fall of 2018, some pundits criticized the Democratic field for not pounding away on Trump. Pelosi’s view, she recalled, was: “Yeah, that’s what Hillary did, not what we’re doing.” With the threat of a blue wave becoming more real by the week in 2018, the Republicans returned to the formula that had served them so well over the past decade. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, more than 135,600 House and Senate ads in the 2018 cycle mentioned Pelosi “in an entirely negative context.” Navigating these headwinds was easier in some places than in others. The Second Congressional District of Virginia, for example, had been in G.O.P. hands since 2010, when Republicans successfully tagged the Democratic incumbent, Glenn Nye — a moderate whose voting record was ranked the ninth most independent in the entire House — as “Pelosi’s congressman.” Nye told me after the 2010 election that although Pelosi generously raised funds on his behalf, he still blamed her in part for his defeat. “My feeling was kind of, a better way to help would have been to help me with the environment. Because the environment” — by which he meant the liberal aura of Nancy Pelosi — “defeated me more than anything else.” This year’s Democratic candidate for Nye’s old seat was Elaine Luria, a 43-year-old former Navy commander. An entrepreneur who previously voted Republican, she was well suited to a district populated by conservative-minded veterans, and she carried no personal baggage. In her campaign, Luria emphasized her military service and her commitment to pocketbook issues, while criticizing the G.O.P. incumbent, Scott Taylor, for his vote against Obamacare. She also outraised him in individual contributions. Though Luria had never met Pelosi, she did accept a $17,000 donation from Pelosi’s PAC. A growing number of this year’s Democratic candidates in Republican-leaning districts felt obliged to say publicly that if elected they would support a change in leadership; Luria would not say whether she would vote for Pelosi as speaker. The National Republican Congressional Committee attack ads echoed a familiar theme: “Liberal Nancy Pelosi is pulling Luria’s strings.” “Your vote determines if she becomes speaker again. ... Pelosi says amnesty to illegal immigrants and gun controls. It’s what you get if Elaine Luria gets elected.” Luria had jumped to the lead in August, but a poll in mid-October had her down by seven points. On Election Day, the district was swamped with unusually heavy turnout. About a half-hour before midnight, Taylor called Luria and conceded defeat. Late that night, the congresswoman-elect received another call. It was from Nancy Pelosi. “So glad to have you join us,” she said. Two days after the election, at just before 10 a.m., Pelosi let me into her office in the House minority leader’s suite. She had gotten very little sleep, and was subsisting, she claimed, on “very, very dark chocolate.” She referred several times to the 19 women like Luria who had helped push the House Democrats well over the threshold of 23 seats needed to reclaim the majority. In 1992, Congress’s so-called Year of the Woman, a record-breaking 106 female House candidates were on the ballot. This year there were 233, and more than 100 of them won. Though Pelosi did not volunteer this to me, the infusion of women into the Democratic caucus carried considerable political significance to her. She lent financial support to many of them during the campaign and had every intention of tying her fate to theirs, as a close Pelosi associate told me shortly before the election: “If you look at these women who are poised to win, the second generation of Year of the Woman, do you really think they’re going to say, ‘Let’s not have a woman as speaker?’ ” The day after the election, however, news leaked of a conference call among Pelosi’s detractors in the caucus. The nine or so dissidents — led by Kathleen Rice of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado — had begun reaching out to about a dozen successful Democratic candidates to see if they were now willing to make good on their publicly expressed skepticism about Pelosi as leader. Perlmutter, who backed Tim Ryan over Pelosi in 2016, told me, “For me — and I’m even more emphatic about it than I was two years ago — this is about change. You look in the middle of the country, at the districts we picked up — a lot of the candidates said they wouldn’t support her, or avoided the question. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent demonizing her, and it’s permeated the public’s view of her. That’s not her fault. But what she hasn’t done is have a succession plan. And that’s an element of being a leader.” A new speaker would need to win a total of 218 votes on the House floor. Assuming that the Democrats take 232 seats after the final ballot-counting, and assuming as well that no Republican votes in her favor, Pelosi could afford to lose 14 votes but no more. Perlmutter insists that Pelosi is beneath the 218 threshold — but the rebels have yet to find anyone in their caucus willing to present themselves as an alternative. Their best hope seems to be to play a game of chicken with the Democratic leader, threatening to withhold votes unless she agrees to certain concessions, like a clearly defined time limit to her tenure as speaker. Pelosi told me a few days before the election that she wouldn’t find it necessary to stay on if a Democrat became president in 2020. “I could walk away from that,” she said. “We’d be in good hands.” But she also mentioned that there were things she would like to accomplish that would probably be impossible under Trump, like addressing climate change. As always, Pelosi was preserving her options, assessing her leverage, committing to nothing until she had to. Trump had called to congratulate her on election night, while she and other party leaders were gathered in a ballroom at the Hyatt near the Capitol. She could barely hear him over the cheering, but he said something about a willingness to work on infrastructure. Of course, Pelosi told me, Trump said the same thing to her on the phone just after he was elected. “We just have to hope,” she said. “You always have to try.” At least Trump “didn’t declare the election illegal,” Pelosi said. “We had a plan for that” — though really, she acknowledged, the only workable plan was “to win big. Had it been four or five seats, he would’ve tried to dismantle it.” In his news conference the day after the midterms, Trump spoke respectfully of Pelosi: “I give her a great deal of credit for what she’s done and what she’s accomplished. Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs.” But Trump also warned darkly that if the House Democrats hounded his administration with investigations, he would urge the Republican-controlled Senate to investigate Pelosi’s caucus — and, he said, “I think I’m better at that game than they are, actually.” Then, as if to test their resolve, Trump rounded off the day by demanding the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replacing him with Sessions’s chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, who had been publicly critical of the Mueller investigation into possible Russian involvement in Trump’s 2016 campaign. In the Trump era, Pelosi told me, it was obvious that the Democrats could not afford to let the president dominate every news cycle. “I do see the role as less work horse and more show horse now,” she said. But she insisted that she would gladly cede the public advocacy to her caucus’s more able communicators, like Adam Schiff, who would most likely be replacing Trump’s ally Devin Nunes as the new House Intelligence Committee chairman. “Oh, I prefer it,” she said. “And Adam, compared to Nunes — what a joke!” But already, one of Pelosi’s top lieutenants seemed to have wandered off-message: The conservative columnist Mollie Hemingway reported the day after the midterms that the incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerry Nadler of New York, had been overheard on an Acela train by an unspecified source telling someone on the phone that he intended to investigate whether Justice Brett Kavanaugh committed perjury during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Though Pelosi was reluctant to discuss the matter with me, it was obvious from her pursed lips what she thought of Nadler’s comments. In addition to the daily combat with the White House, the probable speaker had a new caucus to tend to. Members of the Progressive Caucus were claiming that the Democrats had their energy to thank for the election results. “The majority came from other districts,” Pelosi noted wryly, but “everybody’s in a leveraging mood right now.” Five days after Pelosi said this, Ocasio-Cortez joined activists staging a sit-in outside the minority leader’s office for congressional action on climate change. Meanwhile, requests for committee assignments were already pouring in, requiring the usual calibrations on her part: who needed a national-security-related credential, which caucuses and state delegations needed more representation where, who had been loyal to Pelosi, who had not. And which newer members should she lift into the ranks of leadership? Despite her debt to the dozens of new women, Pelosi did not appear to see it as her obligation to nurture them in any particular way. “It’s not a choice of whether I’d hand it to them on a silver platter or not,” she said. “It’s, do members want somebody anointed? I don’t think they do. The person has to emerge. People have to emerge. And it’s hard.” But, she believed, a new leader would materialize. “We always say when the new ones come: ‘Here are the freshman recruits. Who among them will be the leaders in this Congress? Or rise in other offices? Or be president of the United States? Let’s see the opportunity.’ ” For a moment I mistook her words as sentimental — hope springing eternal, opening day, the circle of life or some such. But no. This was Machiavellian. Power had to be seized from someone else. I suggested that there were sometimes surprises you couldn’t predict. The barest trace of a smile crossed Pelosi’s lips. “I don’t think anybody could have predicted it in me,” she said. Robert Draper is a writer at large for the magazine.

USA TODAY Secret Service agents walk the parade route as President Donald J. Trump's motorcade moves along. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON — The Secret Service can no longer pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission – in large part due to the sheer size of President Trump's family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the East Coast. Secret Service Director Randolph "Tex" Alles, in an interview with USA TODAY, said more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year. The agency has faced a crushing workload since the height of the contentious election season, and it has not relented in the first seven months of the administration. Agents must protect Trump – who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia – and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseas. "The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,'' Alles said. "I can't change that. I have no flexibility.'' Alles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of White House protectees. Under Trump, 42 people have protection, a number that includes 18 members of his family. That's up from 31 during the Obama administration. Overwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the Secret Service ranks, yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding, Alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already done. The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump's first term. But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. "I don't see this changing in the near term,'' Alles said. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed deep concern for the continuing stress on the agency, first thrust into turmoil five years ago with disclosures about sexual misconduct by agents in Colombia and subsequent White House security breaches. A special investigative panel formed after a particularly egregious 2014 White House breach also found that that agents and uniform officers worked "an unsustainable number of hours,'' which also contributed to troubling attrition rates. While about 800 agents and uniformed officers were hired during the past year as part of an ongoing recruiting blitz to bolster the ranks, attrition limited the agency's net staffing gain to 300, according to agency records. And last year, Congress had to approve a one-time fix to ensure that 1,400 agents would be compensated for thousands of hours of overtime earned above compensation limits. Last year's compensation shortfall was first disclosed by USA TODAY. "It is clear that the Secret Service's demands will continue to be higher than ever throughout the Trump administration,'' said Jennifer Werner, a spokesperson for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. Related:Hundreds of Secret Service agents maxed out on overtime Secret Service tightens White House security on south side Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee who was the first lawmaker to sound the alarm after last year's disclosure that hundreds of agents had maxed out on pay, recently spoke with Alles and pledged support for a more permanent fix, Werner said. "We cannot expect the Secret Service to be able to recruit and keep the best of the best if they are not being paid for these increases (in overtime hours)." South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House oversight panel, is "working with other committees of jurisdiction to explore ways in which we can best support'' the Secret Service, his spokesperson Amanda Gonzalez said. Talks also are underway in the Senate, where the Secret Service has briefed members of the Homeland Security Committee, which directly oversees the the agency's operations. "Ensuring the men and women who put their lives on the line protecting the president, his family and others every day are getting paid fairly for their work is a priority,'' said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the panel's top Democrat. "I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides to get this done.'' Without some legislative relief, though, at least 1,100 agents – for now – would not be eligible for overtime even as one of the agency's largest protective assignments looms next month. Nearly 150 foreign heads of state are expected to converge on New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. Because of the sheer number of high-level dignitaries, the United Nations gathering is traditionally designated by the U.S., as a "National Special Security Event" and requires a massive deployment of security resources managed by the Secret Service. That will be even trickier this year. "Normally, we are not this tapped out,'' said Alles, whom Trump appointed to his post in April. The agents who have reached their compensation limits this year represent about a third of the Secret Service workforce, which was pressed last year to secure both national political conventions in the midst of a rollicking campaign cycle. The campaign featured regular clashes involving protesters at Trump rallies across the country, prompting the Secret Service at one point to erect bike racks as buffers around stages to thwart potential rushes from people in the crowd. Officials had hoped that the agency's workload would normalize after the inauguration, but the president's frequent weekend trips, his family's business travel and the higher number of protectees has made that impossible. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Since his inauguration, Trump has taken seven trips to his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Fla., traveled to his Bedminster, N.J., golf club five times and returned to Trump Tower in Manhattan once. Trump's frequent visits to his "winter White House" and "summer White House" are especially challenging for the agency, which must maintain a regular security infrastructure at each – while still allowing access to paying members and guests. Always costly in manpower and equipment, the president's jaunts to Mar-a-Lago are estimated to cost at least $3 million each, based on a General Accountability Office estimate for similar travel by former President Obama. The Secret Service has spent some $60,000 on golf cart rentals alone this year to protect Trump at both Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster. The president, First Lady Melania Trump and the couple's youngest son Barron – who maintained a separate detail in Trump Tower until June – aren't the only ones on the move with full-time security details in tow. Trump's other sons, Trump Organization executives Donald Jr. and Eric, based in New York, also are covered by security details, including when they travel frequently to promote Trump-branded properties in other countries. A few examples: Earlier this year, Eric Trump's business travel to Uruguay cost the Secret Service nearly $100,000 just for hotel rooms. Other trips included the United Kingdom and the Dominican Republic. In February, both sons and their security details traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, for the opening of new Trump hotel there, and to Dubai to officially open a Trump International Golf Club. In March, security details accompanied part of the family, including Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner on a skiing vacation in Aspen, Colo. Even Tiffany Trump, the president's younger daughter, took vacations with her boyfriend to international locales such as Germany and Hungary, which also require Secret Service protection.

(Photo: John Locher, AP) While Alles has characterized the security challenges posed by the Trump administration as a new "reality" of the agency's mission, the former Marine Corps major general said he has discussed the agency's staffing limitations with the White House so that security operations are not compromised by a unusually busy travel schedule. "They understand,'' Alles said. "They accommodate to the degree they can and to the degree that it can be controlled. They have been supportive the whole time.'' Over time, Alles expects the Secret Service's continued hiring campaign will gradually relieve the pressure. From its current force of 6,800 agents and uniform officers, the goal is to reach 7,600 by 2019 and 9,500 by 2025. "We're making progress,'' he said. For now, Alles is focused simply on ensuring that his current agents will be paid for the work they have already done. "We have them working all night long; we're sending them on the road all of the time,'' Alles said. "There are no quick fixes, but over the long term, I've got to give them a better balance (of work and private life) here."

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis - RC15C0656120 (REUTERS/Leah Millis) With a few more races to be decided it is clear Democrats have a commanding majority in the House of Representatives. That majority will allow Democrats to act and pass a wide range of initiatives next session. The question is will the Senate, which remains under Republican control, support any of them? That question clearly looms large for Donald Trump. If the House impeached Trump would the Senate do the same? It is clearly a concern for the president, considering the series of moves he has made since firing former FBI Director James Comey. And his actions have only accelerated the weeks before and after the midterm election in an effort to protect him from impeachment. Long before the November 6 election, Trump has been focused on confirming judges. Eighty-four judges have been confirmed as a result, including two Supreme Court justices – the most recent and controversial choice being Brett Kavanaugh. Trump’s appointment of conservative justices who are indebted to him for their new posts is an insurance policy that they will rule in his favor if Mueller’s investigation should reach their court. Clearly, Kavanaugh is the ultimate goal-line stand in this respect. If any cases about the Mueller investigation reach the Supreme Court, it is clear Trump expects Kavanaugh to side with him. This is why many people believe Kavanaugh should recuse himself from any Mueller case before the Court – especially after his confirmation hearing left many unresolved questions, pointedly asked by Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and others, about his involvement in and knowledge about the Russia investigation. Trump did little on this from following Kavanaugh’s confirmation, until he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than 12 hours after all the polls closed on November 6, thus setting in motion a series of moves to protect him from the Mueller investigation and impeachment. Trump long complained about the fact that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and wasn’t protecting him as a result. With reports of possible indictments coming, Trump took the first chance to fire Sessions – even going so far as to insist that he leave that very day. Within minutes of Sessions’ firing, Trump installed Matt Whitaker, an unknown Iowa lawyer and Republican activist who had become Sessions’ chief of staff, and is now the Acting Attorney General. Last but not least is the nuclear option: Fire Mueller. This option is the equivalent of mutually assured destruction in warfare. Whitaker, without Senate confirmation and with fewer qualifications, is clearly there to do one job: Protect Trump from the Mueller investigation. With hours of cable news appearances available as evidence that he would do just that, it is clear Whitaker opposes the investigation and has offered many ways to end it. For that reason alone he should recuse himself. Yet Whitaker has refused to do so and that suits Trump just fine. While Trump couldn’t make any moves during the fall campaign without risking political backlash, he did spend weeks campaigning trying to win Republican Senate seats. And he didn’t stop once the election was over. With the Florida Senate seat in a recount (it was decided Sunday in favor of Republican Rick Scott), Trump used his Twitter account to campaign for Scott just as he did during his visits to Florida – as if it were a life or death mission. Well, it just might be that. If there is a move to impeach Trump based on the Mueller investigation in the House, controlled by Democrats, then he needs to make sure there are enough votes in the Senate to reject it. Trump is clearly betting that the more Republicans there are in the Senate the less likely it is that he will be removed from office. That is what saved Bill Clinton. The House voted to impeach Clinton but it was the Senate that acquitted him 55-45 in 1999. However, that would require virtually every Republican to reject the findings of the Mueller investigation. That may also explain why Trump is planning at least one campaign trip to Mississippi to make sure the controversial Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith wins her runoff election against Democrat and former Congressman Mike Espy. Trump is also now hedging his bets with the House by supporting Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. Or so he thinks. Trump clearly believes he can flatter his way into Nancy Pelosi’s heart by promoting her as Speaker, even offering to round up Republican votes for her to make she sure wins the post. Pelosi will be Speaker, as I wrote last week, without any votes from Republicans, let alone with help from Trump. Nor will she be persuaded not to impeach Trump based on his overtures. No, Pelosi will decide based on the facts and the evidence – as she and everyone else should. But wait, there’s more… Trump is not only lobbying to make Pelosi Speaker, he’s also lobbying for Republicans – Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio – to lead the GOP on the Judiciary Committee that will address the Mueller investigation and any impeachment hearings. Graham and Jordan have emerged as two of Trump’s most fierce defenders. Placing them in leadership positions on the Judiciary Committee to derail hearings, squash evidence, and launch investigations of Democrats is exactly what Trump wants from them. They appear more than willing to oblige. Last but not least is the nuclear option: Fire Mueller. This option is the equivalent of mutually assured destruction in warfare. Trump would fire Mueller out of desperation – a last choice left on the table in an effort to postpone his fate in the investigation. But, postponing is not stopping. Firing Mueller would insure that Trump would set in motion a crisis that would engulf him, his administration, and likely accelerate his demise. That doesn’t mean Trump won’t do it. And doing so won’t end the investigation or its findings from coming to light either. How that ends, no one knows. Ultimately, all these measures and more won’t be enough to save Trump if the investigation and the facts prove there was wrongdoing by the president and his associates. But don’t underestimate the lengths Trump will go to save himself. And that means everything we have been through these last two years is nothing compared to what we are likely to go through in the days to come.

In fact, the home is in Lakeside, Calif. In the original broadcast of this game, we said, "It's a genuine Veg-O-Matic from Ron Popeil, donated by his daughter after his death." Ron Popeil is not dead. The Veg-O-Matic is from inventor Samuel Popeil – Samuel's daughter Lisa donated the Veg-O-Matic after her father's death. Samuel Popeil's son, Ron Popeil, who founded Ronco Inventions and popularly marketed the device, is still alive.

His story asserted that Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to be the next CIA director, played a role in the treatment of al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah during interrogations at a "black site" in Thailand and that she had "mocked" Zubaydah. On March 15, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology. Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment. During this report, we say that Gina Haspel ran a black site prison in Thailand where al-Qaida suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded. She did run that site for a time after the Sept. 11 attacks, but as ProPublica has now acknowledged in a retraction of its reporting, she was not there when Zubaydah was waterboarded.

Two House Democrats subsequently alleged that Zinke used federal dollars to promote Saccone's candidacy; they called for an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which handles ethics cases.

In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction. Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question.

Groves describes what he says was his father's anguish over a front-page newspaper story. Our Web coverage includes illustrations that make it appear as if a photo of Groves' brother was on the front page and that the family's name was in the headline. But archives show that the Cincinnati Enquirer's coverage did not include a front-page image of Groves' brother. The family's name was not in the headline. Instead, the brother's name appeared inside the newspaper. The details about others in this report — including researchers Lamar Pierce, Francesca Gino and Ann Tenbrunsel — are not in question. The blog Paul Vanderveen's Attitude of Reciprocity drew NPR's attention back to this story. An early version of this story reported that White had won silver — that was after the second run had completed. On the third run, White won gold. A previous version of this story incorrectly described a related NPR report as being from 2017. The report was from 2016. A previous version of this story incorrectly said the CEO of Insys Therapeutics was charged in October. It was founder and former CEO John Kapoor who was charged. Clarified a sentence to make it clear that it was women's snowboarding slopestyle that debuted in the Sochi Olympic Games. Administration officials say the president's plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. A previous version of this story incorrectly said $200 million. In one clue, we refer to ticks as insects. Ticks are arachnids. In a previous version of this story and headline, NPR reported that four people had been killed. The correct number of casualties is three dead and four injured. In a previous version of this story and headline, we incorrectly said that Mary Lou McDonald is the first female leader of Sinn Fein. In fact, Margaret Buckley led the party from 1937 to 1950. An earlier version of this story used the incorrect pronoun "him" in the sentence "And she's adamant that Marina not attend Orlando's funeral, something she emphasizes by always addressing her as Daniel." In this story, we refer to Toby Groves' lie in 2004 on his mortgage loan application as "his first bad act." We should have noted that according to court records, Groves admitted that he began the "scheme" to defraud banks "on or about June 30, 2003." In addition, court records show he admitted to owing the federal Internal Revenue Service $299,997 for claims made about the tax years 2001-2003. Also in this story, Groves discusses what he sees as a key moment in his life — his brother's 1986 bank fraud conviction.

The blog Paul Vanderveen's Attitude of Reciprocity drew NPR's attention back to this story. An earlier version of this story stated that the vice president supports "gay conversation therapy." It should have said "conversion therapy." This article originally described autism as a type of psychiatric disorder. It is actually a developmental disorder. A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to Africa as a country. Africa is a continent. A correction to a correction: We were right the first time. Jack Bergeson was 16 when he entered the race. He's now 17. An earlier Web version of this story misspelled Kristine DeLong's first name as Christine. A previous version of this story reversed the couple's ages. In fact, John Banvard is 100, while Gerard "Jerry" Nadeau is 72. A previous version of this story stated that the Recording Academy has never asked its members to provide demographic data about themselves. NARAS does collect demographic data on its membership, but does not require that members provide that information. As a result, it does not have complete data on its membership. NARAS added that it does not collect demographic information on Grammy winners or nominees. A previous version of this story incorrectly said the World Cup soccer tournament was held in 2015. It was actually in 2014. In this story, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón mistakenly tells host Ari Shapiro that felons in California are not allowed to vote. In fact, felons are only barred from voting while incarcerated in prison or on parole. A previous version of this story misspelled Rep. Luis Gutierrez's last name as Guttierez. A previous version of this post incorrectly referred to the Minnesota Twins as the Minneapolis Twins. A previous version of this essay may have implied that the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe uses blood quantum requirements for enrollment. This is not the case.

It is free only to new members or to those who renew or upgrade their membership in the NRA. Daniel Zwerdling's career with NPR spanned nearly four decades. A previous version of this post incorrectly said three decades. This report incorrectly refers to a group of demonstrators as Mothers Demand Common Sense For Gun Reform. The correct name is Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. A previous version of this story misspelled the name of the the Nielsen marketing research company as Neilson. In this report, we say that Erin Hamlin's medal in Sochi marked the first time an American luger reached an Olympic podium. In fact, while she is the first U.S. singles luger to win a medal, there have been U.S. doubles lugers who have won medals. A previous version of this story misidentified the curator of entomology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The curator's name is Brian Brown, not Paul Brown. A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Rep. Adam Schiff as a Republican. Schiff is a Democrat. We incorrectly identify Rod Rosenstein as the deputy director of the FBI. Rosenstein is the deputy attorney general of the U.S. In this report, we say Brad Chapin was among dozens of people testifying in support of London Breed, San Francisco's acting mayor. As Chapin said at a public meeting, he believes the acting or appointed mayor should be a woman of color such as Breed. But his preferred candidate for mayor in the June election is a different city supervisor, Jane Kim. A previous Web version of this story said 1,000 megawatts of electricity could power about 1,000 homes. It should have said 800,000 homes.

The reporter for this story is Zach Hirsch, not Brian Mann as in a previous byline. A caption on a previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Rebekah Martinez's first name as Rebecca. In addition, we incorrectly said there were two dozen contestants on Season 22 of The Bachelor. There were 29.

It's Trunk Island on St. John, not Magens Bay on St. Thomas. Additionally, Andrew Clutz's name was misspelled as Klutz. A previous version of this story misspelled Nielsen as Nielson in some references. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the affected area was 104 feet by 328 feet. The area is 164 feet by 328 feet. A previous version of this report misidentified the business partner of Paul Manafort who was charged with conspiracy and money laundering. He is Rick Gates, not Carter Page. An earlier version of this story said the suit was filed for eight plaintiffs who were detained and one who was deported. The eight plaintiffs include the person who was deported. A caption on a previous version of this story said the crash site was south of Charlottesville. It is 12 miles west. An earlier version of this story referred to the Drug Enforcement Administration as the Drug Enforcement Agency. A previous version of this story misidentifed Adrienne Keene as Adrienne King. Nanga Parbat was first summited during winter in 2016, not 2014 as a previous version of this post said. In the audio of this story, as in a previous Web version, we say the Station F space covers 110,000 square feet. In fact, it's 366,000 square feet. A previous version of this post said 10 planetary boundaries have been identified. In fact, nine have been identified. A previous version of this story incorrectly said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program will end next month. The actual date is March 5. A headline on a previous version of this story incorrectly referred to seagrass as seaweed. In the interview, Thomas Homan said ICE "will not turn a blind eye to somebody that we find during our enforcement operations that's in the country illegally." A previous version of the transcript was incorrect. He did not say "in the country legally." A previous version of this story located Hue as just north of Saigon. It's actually more than 600 miles north of there. Additionally, a reference to Doc Gosselin's last name was misspelled as Gooslin.  An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Cassio and Lepidus were characters in Julius Caesar. In fact, Cassio appears in Othello and Lepidus in Antony and Cleopatra, where his drinking becomes an issue, as well as in Julius Caesar. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we incorrectly say that at least 16 people were shot in addition to the two fatalities. Not all of those who were injured were shot. A previous version of this story misidentified the author as Richard Harris. He is Robert Harris. A previous version of this story misstated the name of a Casey Affleck movie as I'm Not There. The correct title is I'm Still Here. An earlier version of this story misidentified Alan Trammell as Jack Trammell. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Spider-Man 2 was only nominated for sound mixing and visual effects. In fact, it won for visual effects and was nominated for both sound mixing and sound editing. In addition, the story also said The Incredibles won for best animated feature in 2004. The movie was released in 2004 but won its Oscar in 2005. Also, the story said The Dark Knight was passed over for best picture in 2008. The movie came out in 2008, but the nominations and awards show were in 2009. In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses. Previously posted on Jan. 8: We say that Irish voters elected a gay, biracial prime minister. In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election — and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Larry Nassar's sentence was handed down on Tuesday. It was Wednesday. Additionally, we previously said Nassar's statement to victims came after his sentence was announced. It came before the sentence. A previous version of this post referred to Helle Thorning-Schmidt as the former Dutch prime minister. In fact, she was the prime minister of Denmark. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly identified Charlie Dent as a senator. Dent is a representative. In this report we say that roughly 100 people are losing their DACA status per week. We should have said per day. A previous photo caption misspelled Rafael Mercedes' first name as Raphael. In the introduction to this report, we mistakenly say the earthquake was in the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, it was in the Pacific Ocean. A previous version of this story misspelled Realtor Tanya Gersh's first name as Tonya in one instance. A previous version of this post incorrectly referred to the band Ladysmith Black Mambazo as Ladyship Black Mambozo. A previous version of this Web story said Three Day Rule's database of singles came from partnerships with online dating sites. The company's singles database is separate from its online dating site partnerships. Previous audio and Web versions of this story suggested that Americans are no longer legally required to buy health insurance. That's incorrect. The individual mandate to buy health insurance that was part of the Affordable Care Act — requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face a financial penalty — is still in effect until 2019. Additionally, former President Barack Obama's first name was misspelled as Barak. A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly referred to the movie In the Fade as Into the Fade. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Dylan O'Riordan was brought to the U.S. on a visitor's visa. He came under the visa waiver program.

An earlier Web version of this story quoted Bob Bland as saying Nevada voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in 2016. Nevada is a longtime swing state that went to Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. A previous version of this story stated that Americans will burn 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel made from soybean oil this year. In fact, some of that biodiesel will be made from other oils, including corn oil, canola oil and recycled cooking oil. A previous Web introduction to this story incorrectly stated that Matthew Kluger was a professor at George Mason University. He is a professor at Northwestern University. An earlier version of this story erroneously stated the DACA program will end in March 2017. The correct date for the end of the program is March 2018, absent a new law codifying it or a further delay of its termination by the Trump administration. A previous version of this story misspelled James Toback's last name as Torbeck. In this story, we say that two members of Congress, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, have resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, Rep. Trent Franks also resigned, for a total of three. A previous version of this story described Straight, No Chaser as a Clint Eastwood film. Charlotte Zwerin directed the film. Eastwood produced it. A previous Web and audio version of this story said the sale of Fiona-related items generated about $3 million for the zoo. However, the $2 million to $3 million number refers to the estimated boost to the local economy from the Fiona-related sales and tourism. We say President Trump's cognitive test took 30 minutes to complete. In fact, the White House physician did not say how long the test lasted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment typically takes about 10 minutes. Saxophonist Lester Young did perform with Benny Goodman on the Carnegie Hall stage in 1938, but the saxophone solo during "One O'Clock Jump" that is heard in this story was played by Babe Russin. A previous version of this story said Russell M. Nelson has 116 grandchildren. In fact, Nelson has 116 great-grandchildren. Additionally, we also quoted Russell M. Nelson as saying, "Two days ago, my brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles laid hands upon my hands." In fact, Nelson said "laid hands upon my head."

In fact, the decline in mortality is not limited to the unemployed. An earlier version of this story misspelled Johnathon Shillings' first name as Johnathan. A previous photo caption in this story said Ben and Tara were married in 2014 and Ben was diagnosed two years later. They were actually married in 2015 and Ben was diagnosed in 2016. A previous version of this story was missing the 12:30 a.m. time stamp, when investigators noted that the privacy settings on Marilou Danley's Facebook account had been changed.

While he did graduate from Yale University, he, in fact, earned his law degree from the University of Virginia. A previous version of this story misspelled Sen. David Perdue's last name as Purdue. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Dr. Ronny Jackson will brief reporters on Oct. 16. In fact, he will do so on Jan. 16.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said that the only field test of the 2020 census questions is set to begin in April in Rhode Island's Providence County. The Census Bureau has conducted previous tests of potential questions, and participants in Providence County can take part in the last scheduled field test beginning in March. A previous version of this story misspelled Timothy Piazza's last name as Piazzaz. In the audio, as in a previous Web version, we say historian Danielle McGuire met Recy Taylor on President Barack Obama's Inauguration Day in 2008. The correct year is 2009. A previous version of this story referred to Dartmouth College as Dartmouth University. The audio of this story incorrectly states that Tonya Harding landed the first triple axel in Olympics competition history.

A previous version of this story incorrectly said Steve Bannon had been the chairman of the Trump campaign. He was the CEO. A previous version of the Web story incorrectly stated that more than half of the nation's Latino population lives in Los Angeles. It should have said that in Los Angeles, about half of the population is Latino. A previous version of this story referred to Meghan Markle as a princess-to-be. In fact, she will not be known as Princess Meghan. It is more likely that the queen will make Prince Harry a duke and Markle will become a duchess. A previous version of this story said Iceland has had a law against pay discrimination since 1963; in fact, the law passed in 1961. A previous headline misstated the title of the film as In The Land Of The Pomegranates; the correct title has no second "the." Also, because of an error in the press materials, Hava Kohav Beller's first name was misspelled as Hova. A previous version of this story said the Dow rose 4,000 points over the last four months. It rose by that amount over the last 10 months. This post has been updated to include comments from Mark Memmott. A previous caption misidentified Interstate 16 as Interstate 26. The audio of this story describes Papa, Jake and Kevin as elementary school students. They're actually eighth-graders, but in Chicago, kindergarten through eighth grade is referred to as elementary school. A previous version of this story said Republican Joshua Cole was certified as the winner in District 28. In fact, Republican Robert Thomas was certified as the winner. Cole is a Democrat. A previous version of this story misspelled the name of music publisher Wixen as Wixin. An earlier Web version of this story credited some information to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. The information came from the American Veterinary Medical Association. During this conversation, we mistakenly say that The New York Times reported George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat about a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. In fact, the Times reported that Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had collected potentially damaging information about Democratic political candidate Hillary Clinton. An earlier transcript referred to Luxembourg for Finance as a government bank. In fact, it is the agency for the development of the Luxembourg financial center. A previous version of this story said that if Mitt Romney ran for Senate from Utah, it would be his first run for Congress. Romney ran for Senate in 1994, losing to Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy. Additionally, Orrin Hatch and Thad Cochran were incorrectly referred to as Senate pro tempore. The correct term is president pro tempore. The original story incorrectly stated that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida came in second place in the 2016 Utah GOP caucuses. It was Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. A reference to all Aleut villages being burned as part of a "scorched earth" policy has been removed because not all the villages were, in fact, burned. A reference to a quote from a video has been removed because the online transcript of that documentary does not include the quote, in which an Army officer purportedly told Aleuts that "y'all look like Japs." Details about how and when Aleuts were moved from their villages were removed to clarify that they were not all transported at the same time. A reference to "Excursion Bay" was fixed to say "Excursion Inlet." The year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established was 1980, not 1988 as originally published. A correction posted here on Feb. 22 has been removed because it mistakenly stated that President Reagan signed that commission into law. In fact, it was President Carter. An earlier version of this story identified Sarah Broderick as CEO/CFO of Vice. She is COO/CFO. In previous audio and a Web introduction for this page, we said President Trump named Jerusalem the capital of Israel. In fact, he didn't name it as the capital; he said the U.S. would recognize it as the capital. In this story, Nikki Haley is described incorrectly as the U.S. ambassador to the United States. In fact, she is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. A previous Web version of this story misstated the name of Oxford American's deputy editor. He is Maxwell George, not George Maxwell.

The correct amount is 0.25 ounces — or 2 1/4 teaspoons. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor
---split---37.0---split---http://www.people-press.org/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/---split---Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World About Follow  U.S. Politics & Policy One of the biggest challenges facing those who seek to understand U.S. elections is establishing an accurate portrait of the American electorate and the choices made by different kinds of voters. Obtaining accurate data on how people voted is difficult for a number of reasons. Surveys conducted before an election can overstate – or understate – the likelihood of some voters to vote. Depending on when a survey is conducted, voters might change their preferences before Election Day. Surveys conducted after an election can be affected by errors stemming from respondents’ recall, either for whom they voted for or whether they voted at all. Even the special surveys conducted by major news organizations on Election Day – the “exit polls” – face challenges from refusals to participate and from the fact that a sizable minority of voters actually vote prior to Election Day and must be interviewed using conventional surveys beforehand. This report introduces a new approach for looking at the electorate in the 2016 general election: matching members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel to voter files to create a dataset of verified voters. The analysis in this report uses post-election survey reports of 2016 vote preferences (conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 12, 2016) among those who were identified as having voted using official voting records. These voter file records become available in the months after the election. (For more details, see “Methodology.”) Among these verified voters, the overall vote preference mirrors the election results very closely: 48% reported voting for Hillary Clinton and 45% for Donald Trump; by comparison, the official national vote tally was 48% for Clinton, 46% for Trump. This data source allows researchers to take a detailed look at the voting preferences of Americans across a range of demographic traits and characteristics. It joins resources already available – including the National Election Pool exit polls, the American National Election Studies and the Current Population Survey’s Voting and Registration Supplement – in hopes of helping researchers continue to refine their understanding of the 2016 election and electorate, and address complex questions such as the role of race and education in 2016 candidate preferences. It reaffirms many of the key findings about how different groups voted – and the composition of the electorate – that emerged from post-election analyses based on other surveys. Consistent with other analyses and past elections, race was strongly correlated with voting preference in 2016. But there are some differences as well. For instance, the wide educational divisions among white voters seen in other surveys are even more striking in these data. Overall, whites with a four-year college degree or more education made up 30% of all validated voters. Among these voters, far more (55%) said they voted for Clinton than for Trump (38%). Among the much larger group of white voters who had not completed college (44% of all voters), Trump won by more than two-to-one (64% to 28%). There also were large differences in voter preferences by gender, age and marital status. Women were 13 percentage points more likely than men to have voted for Clinton (54% among women, 41% among men). The gender gap was particularly large among validated voters younger than 50. In this group, 63% of women said they voted for Clinton, compared with just 43% of men. Among voters ages 50 and older, the gender gap in support for Clinton was much narrower (48% vs. 40%). About half (52%) of validated voters were married; among them, Trump had a 55% to 39% majority. Among unmarried voters, Clinton led by a similar margin (58% to 34%). Just 13% of validated voters in 2016 were younger than 30. Voters in this age group reported voting for Clinton over Trump by a margin of 58% to 28%, with 14% supporting one of the third-party candidates. Among voters ages 30 to 49, 51% supported Clinton and 40% favored Trump. Trump had an advantage among 50- to 64-year-old voters (51% to 45%) and those 65 and older (53% to 44%). For a detailed breakdown of the composition of the 2016 electorate and voting preferences among a wide range of subgroups of voters, see Appendix. For the survey methodology and details on how survey respondents were matched to voter records, see “Methodology.” Voter choice and party affiliation were nearly synonymous. Republican validated voters reported choosing Trump by a margin of 92% to 4%, while Democrats supported Clinton by 94% to 5%. The roughly one-third (34%) of the electorate who identified as independent or with another party divided their votes about evenly (43% Trump, 42% Clinton). Similarly, voting was strongly correlated with ideological consistency, based on a scale composed of 10 political values – including opinions on race, homosexuality, the environment, foreign policy and the social safety net. Respondents are placed into five categories ranging from “consistently conservative” to “consistently liberal.” (For more, see “The Partisan Divide on Political Values Grows Even Wider.”) Virtually all validated voters with consistently liberal values voted for Clinton over Trump (95% to 2%), while nearly all those with consistently conservative values went for Trump (98% to less than 1% for Clinton). Those who held conservative views on most political values (“mostly conservative”) favored Trump by 87% to 7%, while Clinton received the support of somewhat fewer among those who were “mostly liberal” (78%-13%). Among the nearly one-third of voters whose ideological profile was mixed, the vote was divided (48% Trump, 42% Clinton). As in previous elections, voters in 2016 were sharply divided along religious lines. Protestants constituted about half of the electorate and reported voting for Trump over Clinton by a 56% to 39% margin. Catholics were more evenly divided; 52% reported voting for Trump, while 44% said they backed Clinton. Conversely, a solid majority of the religiously unaffiliated – atheists, agnostics and those who said their religion was “nothing in particular” – said they voted for Clinton (65%) over Trump (24%). Within the Protestant tradition, voters were divided by race and evangelicalism. White evangelical Protestants, who constituted one out of every five voters, consistently have been among the strongest supporters of Republican candidates and supported Trump by a 77% to 16% margin. This is nearly identical to the 78% to 16% advantage that Mitt Romney held over Barack Obama among white evangelicals in Pew Research Center polling on the eve of the 2012 presidential election. Among white mainline Protestants (15% of voters overall) 52% said they voted for Trump and 44% reported voting for Clinton. This, too, was very similar to the mainline Protestant split in 2012. Clinton won overwhelmingly among black Protestants (96% vs. 3% for Trump). White non-Hispanic Catholics supported Trump by a ratio of about two-to-one (64% to 31%), while Hispanic Catholics favored Clinton by an even larger 78% to 19% margin. Among all voters, those who reported attending services at least weekly favored Trump by a margin of 58% to 36%; the margin was similar among those who said they attended once or twice a month (60% to 38%). Those who reported attending services a few times a year or seldom were divided; 51% supported Clinton and 42% supported Trump. Among the nearly one-quarter of voters (23%) who said they never attend religious services, Clinton led Trump by 61% to 3o%. As the pattern of the votes implies, the coalitions that supported the two major party nominees were very different demographically. These differences mirror the broad changes in the compositions of the two parties: The Republican and Democratic coalitions are more dissimilar demographically than at any point in the past two decades. In 2016, a 61% majority of those who said they voted for Clinton were women, while Trump voters were more evenly divided between men and women. Whites constituted nearly nine-in-ten (88%) of Trump’s supporters, compared with a smaller majority (60%) who voted for Clinton. Clinton’s voters also were younger than Trump’s on average (48% were younger than 50, compared with 35% for Trump). Among Clinton voters, 43% were college graduates, compared with 29% of Trump voters. And while non-college whites made up a majority of Trump’s voters (63%), they constituted only about a quarter of Clinton’s (26%). About a third of Clinton voters (32%) lived in urban areas, versus just 12% among Trump voters. By contrast, 35% of Trump voters said they were from a rural area; among Clinton voters, 19% lived in a rural community. The religious profile of the two candidates’ voters also differed considerably. About a third of Clinton voters (35%) were religiously unaffiliated, as were just 14% of Trump voters. White evangelical voters made up a much greater share of Trump’s voters (34%) than Clinton’s (7%). One-in-five Trump voters (20%) were white non-Hispanic Catholics, compared with just 9% of Clinton voters. And black Protestants were 14% of Clintons supporters, while almost no black Protestants in the survey reported voting for Trump. The data also provide a profile of voting-eligible nonvoters. Four-in-ten Americans who were eligible to vote did not do so in 2016. There are striking demographic differences between voters and nonvoters, and significant political differences as well. Compared with validated voters, nonvoters were more likely to be younger, less educated, less affluent and nonwhite. And nonvoters were much more Democratic. Among members of the panel who were categorized as nonvoters, 37% expressed a preference for Hillary Clinton, 30% for Donald Trump and 9% for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein; 14% preferred another candidate or declined to express a preference. Party affiliation among nonvoters skewed even more Democratic than did candidate preferences. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents made up a 55% majority of nonvoters; about four-in-ten (41%) nonvoters were Republicans and Republican leaners. Voters were split almost evenly between Democrats and Democratic leaners (51%) and Republicans and Republican leaners (48%). While nonvoters were less likely than voters to align with the GOP, the picture was less clear with respect to ideology. Owing in part to the tendency of nonvoters to be politically disengaged more generally, there are far more nonvoters than voters who fall into the “mixed” category on the ideological consistency scale. Among nonvoters who hold a set of political values with a distinct ideological orientation, those with generally liberal values (30% of all nonvoters) considerably outnumbered those with generally conservative values (18%). Voters were much more highly educated than nonvoters. Just 16% of nonvoters were college graduates, compared with 37% of voters. Adults with only a high school education constituted half (51%) of nonvoters, compared with 30% among voters. Whites without a college degree made up 43% of nonvoters, about the same as among voters (44%). But nonwhites without a college degree were far more numerous among nonvoters (at 42%) than they were among voters (19%). There also were wide income differences between voters and nonvoters. More than half (56%) of nonvoters reported annual family incomes under $30,000. Among voters, just 28% fell into this income category.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Part 1 of Chris Wallace's exclusive 'Fox News Sunday' interview with President Trump. President Trump, speaking exclusively to Fox News' Chris Wallace in a wide-ranging interview, revealed what President Obama told him was the biggest challenge facing the U.S., discussed pending high-level departures from his administration and admitted that he occasionally enjoys calling on CNN reporter Jim Acosta. "Actually I like to do it, but in many cases I don’t," Trump acknowledged. In ruling that the administration temporarily has to restore Acosta's White House access pass on Fifth Amendment due process grounds, federal judge Timothy J. Kelly noted that Trump could simply choose to ignore the combative reporter. (Kelly, in his preliminary decision, did not rule on CNN's First Amendment claim.) But Trump, speaking to Wallace, floated another idea for handling Acosta, who frequently spars with the president at length during press conferences. "I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows," Trump mused. "I mean, with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen." Calling Acosta "unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman," Trump said his administration is currently formulating "rules and regulations" for White House reporters. "And if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference," the president added.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump also defended Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker against Democrats' calls that he should recuse himself because he has written critically of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which he said in 2017 was at risk of becoming a "political fishing expedition." "I did not know that," Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued Mueller was coming close to exceeding his authority. "I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such." FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: WHITAKER TELLS SEN. GRAHAM HE SEES NO NEED TO RECUSE HIMSELF Trump added that he "would not get involved" in Whitaker's decisions as he oversees Mueller's probe in his new role as head of the Justice Department. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion affirming the constitutionality of Whitaker's temporary appointment without Senate approval. "Look he -- it’s going to be up to him," Trump said. "I think he’s very well aware politically. I think he’s astute politically. He’s a very smart person. A very respected person. He’s going to do what’s right. I really believe he’s going to do what’s right." FILE -Then-Iowa Republican senatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney Matt Whitaker watches before a live televised debate in Johnston, Iowa. (Associated Press) The president added that he has personally responded to Mueller's written questions in the Russia probe and that they would be submitted "very soon." Trump said his team is "writing what I tell them to write" in response to the inquiries. Trump emphasized, however, that he probably would not sit for an in-person interview with Mueller, amid fears voiced by his attorneys that the could be tricked into a so-called "perjury trap" in which, even if the president is honest, his version of events differs from other witness accounts enough to trigger a criminal prosecution. "We’ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is, probably, that we’re finished," Trump said. He continued: "We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn’t have even been asked, and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn’t, you know, I’ll be told and we’ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end." SEN. FLAKE VOWS TO BOYCOTT GOP JUDICIAL NOMINEES UNLESS MUELLER PROTECTION LEGISLATION GETS A VOTE -- BUT GOP RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES Turning to another one of his frequent critics -- former President Barack Obama -- Trump took something of a victory lap, following news that some of the top candidates Obama had backed in the midterm elections had come up short. "I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor," Trump said, referring to defeated Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams' top surrogates. "And it was all stacked against Brian [Kemp], and I was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won." (Abrams acknowledged in a fiery speech this week that she would not win the race, but strongly suggested Republican Brian Kemp had prevailed because of voter suppression, and vowed a lawsuit.) "Look at Florida," Trump continued. "I went down to Florida. [GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. I don’t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end. And if I didn’t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida." The results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate were reported on Sunday, and Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, following a series of lawsuits and snafus that exposed long-running issues with ballot counting in the state. In the gubernatorial race, Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded this weekend in his close fight with Republican Ron DeSantis.

(Photo by Rob Grabowski/Invision/AP) FLORIDA ELECTION BOSS SAYS RACISM MAY BE REASON SHE'S CRITICIZED FOR INCOMPETENCE, POTENTIAL FRAUD But Trump also revealed that Obama, who also campaigned against Trump in several other states, had offered him some important guidance in the White House shortly after his 2016 election. "I think North Korea’s been very tough because you know we were very close. When I took that over -- President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that’s by far the biggest problem that this country has," Trump told Wallace. "And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I’m very happy with the way we went." Addressing national security matters, Trump told Wallace that he has been briefed on the audio recording of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's apparent murder in Turkey, but said he hasn't listened to it, calling it a "suffering tape" that he was advised not to hear. "You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia," Trump said. "But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good." He also said it "takes two to tango" to resolve the conflict in Yemen, where Iranian-backed insurgents are facing off in a proxy war against Saudi-backed forces, noting that "I want Saudi to stop, but I want Iran to stop also." Trump went on to defend his administration's decision to pull hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Pakistan, saying the country doesn't do "a damn thing for us" and charging that its government helped terror leader Osama bin Laden hide there. "They don’t do a damn thing for us." "You know, living – think of this – living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don’t know, I’ve seen nicer," Trump said, referring to bin Laden and his former compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The compound was demolished shortly after United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group forces, in a daring late-night helicopter raid, killed bin Laden there in 2011. "But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there," he added. "And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year . ... [bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we’re supporting Pakistan, we’re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don’t give them anymore, by the way. I ended it because they don’t do anything for us, they don’t do a damn thing for us." Trump also characterized Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the operation to kill bin Laden, as a "Hillary Clinton fan" when Wallace mentioned that he has criticized Trump's harsh rhetoric on the media as a major threat to democracy. McRaven was on Clinton's shortlist for vice president in 2016 and has praised her publicly. "Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn’t it have been nice?” Trump asked Wallace, seemingly attacking either McRaven or Pakistani officials. And Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day -- which Obama did several times when he was in office. "I should have done that," Trump said. "I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ... I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things." 'EMERGENCY' LEFT-WING NYC PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS FIRING HEADS THROUGH UNION SQUARE -- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONY Trump, who spent nearly an hour Thursday at the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. -- where tables were lined with miniature pumpkin pies ahead of Thanksgiving -- said he has some plans to potentially visit U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first time. "Well, I think you will see that happen," the president said, after Wallace noted that Obama and former President George W. Bush had each visited soldiers in war zones. "There are things that are being planned. We don’t want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else."

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Explaining why he canceled a trip to visit a World War I memorial ceremony in Paris, Trump cited the weather and sharply criticized the media for making a "big deal" out of the situation. The president noted he attended an event the next day in the rain at a cemetery just outside Paris on Armistice Day. "They said, 'Sir,' the Secret Service said, 'Sir, you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go,'" Trump said. "Because it was supposed to be helicopter, but the helicopter couldn’t fly because of zero visibility." Calling media reports that he is bitter and resentful following the midterm elections nothing more than "disgusting fake news," Trump next addressed some potential high-level departures from his administration. On Department of Homeland Security head Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump suggested he wants to see an improvement on border security.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) "Well, I like her a lot. I respect her a lot," Trump said, referring to Nielsen. "She’s very smart. I want her to get much tougher and we’ll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough. ... I like her very much, I respect her very much, I’d like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period." He added there's a "chance" that Nielsen, who was accosted in a restaurant this summer by far-left progressive activists as her security detail kept close watch, will continue in her role. Trump definitively told Wallace that Chief of Staff John Kelly will "move on" at some point, even as he claimed there was still some chance Kelly will stay with the administration through 2020. "There are certain things I love what he does," the president said. "And there are certain things that I don’t like that he does -- that aren’t his strength. It’s not that he doesn’t do -- you know he works so hard. He’s doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it’s just not his strength. It’s not his fault, it’s not his strength. ... But John, at some point, is going to want to move on. John will move on." Multiple reports have suggested that Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, will replace Kelly.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - HP1EDAC1F1Q8V (REUTERS) And on Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, whom the White House announced would depart her role this week, Trump offered a blunt assessment. "I met with Mira two days ago, and we’re going to move her around," Trump said. "She was with me for a long time, although I don’t know her. She’s really somebody I don’t know very well. But we’re going to move her around because she’s got certain talents. But, frankly, she is not -- she’ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way. ... She’s not too diplomatic, but she’s talented." Taking stock of the administration's progress after two years, amid some past and apparently pending roster changes, Trump gave himself high marks -- literally. "I think I’m doing a great job. We have the best economy we’ve ever had," the president said. "We’re doing really well. We would have been at war with North Korea if, let’s say, that administration continued forward." Trump continued: "I would give myself, I would – look, I hate to do it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?"

The investigation reveals the most complete picture yet of the staggering inventory and value of Trump-owned real estate. USA TODAY Donald Trump and Phil Ruffin intended their gold-plated tower (a second one was never built) to be a condohotel. (Photo: Steve Marcus for USA TODAY) LAS VEGAS — President Trump’s companies own more than 400 condo units and home lots whose sale could steer millions of dollars to Trump, a USA TODAY investigation has found. USA TODAY spent four months cataloging every property Trump's companies own across the country. Reporters found that Trump’s companies are sitting on at least $250 million of individual properties in the USA alone. Property records show Trump’s trust and his companies own at least 422 luxury condos and penthouses from New York City to Las Vegas, 12 mansion lots on bluffs overlooking his golf course on the Pacific Ocean and dozens more smaller pieces of real estate. The properties range in value from about $200,000 to $35 million each. Unlike developments where Trump licenses his name to a separate developer for a flat fee, profits from selling individual properties directly owned by his companies ultimately enrich him personally. Trump has never disclosed a complete, unit-by-unit inventory of his companies' real estate holdings or sales, nor is he required to do so by federal law. Trump says he's separated himself from his businesses, but the trust set up in January is run by his sons. Trump is the only beneficiary and can withdraw funds at any time. The volume of real estate creates an extraordinary and unprecedented potential for people, corporations or foreign interests to try to influence a president. Anyone who wanted to court favor with the president could snap up multiple properties or purposefully overpay. They could buy in the name of a shell company, making it impossible for the public to know who was behind the sales. The potential for conflicts is exacerbated by Trump's refusal to release his tax returns or fully separate himself from his businesses, breaking with precedent set by presidents going back four decades. Since Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act in 1978, all six presidents from Carter to Obama established blind trusts or limited investments to assets like mutual funds. Trump has not. The president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws that apply to others working in the federal government. He is not required to disclose when units sell or who bought them. He is barred by the Constitution from receiving gifts from foreign governments or officials. Trump’s assessment that the ban doesn’t apply to market-rate transactions is debated in lawsuits and among ethics experts. Regardless, it may be impossible for the public to even know who is behind purchase because the rules governing real estate transactions allow for shell companies to make purchases without disclosing who actually paid the money. “Anyone seeking to influence the president could set up an anonymous company and purchase his property,” said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, a D.C.-based group aimed at curbing illicit financial transactions. “It’s a big black box, and the system is failing as a check for conflicts of interest.” Since Election Day, records show Trump companies have sold at least 14 luxury condos and home-building lots for about $23 million. Half were sold to limited liability companies. No names were listed in deeds, obscuring buyers’ identities. Since launching his White House bid, Trump’s companies have sold at least 58 units nationwide for about $90 million. Almost half of those sold to LLCs. That doesn’t count Trump's ownership of millions of square feet of some of America’s priciest office and retail rental space in Manhattan, Chicago and San Francisco. Buyers and renters of Trump properties include companies or individuals tracing to addresses in at least a dozen countries. The White House refers business inquiries to the Trump Organization, where four separate executives and spokesmen declined to answer specific questions. Bobby Burchfield, an attorney hired as an independent ethics reviewer for Trump Organization business deals, wouldn’t answer specific questions about transactions. Trump attorneys have argued that profits from individual real estate sales would route through a maze of Trump subsidiaries and eventually become mixed in a larger pool of undifferentiated money in the president’s trust. That, they say, makes a direct conflict from an individual sale more difficult to imagine. They do not consider sales of U.S. real estate to foreign investors as “foreign deals." Those in the business of selling Trump-owned real estate say business is up. “I get a lot more phone calls now that he’s the president,” said Shari Sanderson, a real estate agent that sells units in the Las Vegas hotel-condo tower. A couple of weeks before the Republican National Convention, a Las Vegas financial firm filed paperwork to found Milan Investment Limited in Nevada. Days later, the newly minted company went on a buying spree. Milan spent $3.1 million over four months to buy 11 luxury condos in a shimmering golden tower near the Strip that Trump owns with friend and casino mogul Phil Ruffin. Trump Ruffin LLC collected the last of the money weeks before Trump was elected. Milan Investment tracks back to what appears to be an incorrect address, the strip mall office of a financial services firm. The owner, Thomas Sullivan, said he never heard of Milan Investment but said a federal “regulatory” agency visited his office in person asking similar questions. He declined to identify the agency. “We’re completely in the dark,” Sullivan said. “We don’t know if it was a mistake, or they used our address for some reason, but we aren’t associated with them.” On the deeds from Milan’s purchases, Eric Trump signed for the sellers. An accountant signed for the buyers, and deeds do not identify any people behind Milan. USA TODAY tracked corporate, loan and property records across Nevada, Texas and Canada to tie three names to Milan Investment. In Nevada, where rules let anyone form companies without identifying the owners, Milan’s officers are listed as Jun Xu and Qi Huang with an address at an office suite on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Additional documents underlying the sale give two more addresses, both million-dollar condos in Vancouver, for Xu and Huang. Canadian records indicate they own both and hold a license to rent one. The records list Xu as a “businessman” and Huang as a “housewife.” USA TODAY contacted every phone number and address found for Xu and Huang in two countries. Reporters also contacted every business associate identified in Nevada public records as having worked with the company or assisted with the condo buys, trying to reach Xu and Huang or find out more about them. Xu and Huang have not responded. One more name tied to Milan is Chen Huang of Sugar Land, Texas, who signed loan documents “on behalf of Jun Xu and Qi Huang” when they borrowed money using the Vegas condos as collateral. Phone numbers for Chen Huang in Texas were answered but disconnected after a reporter identified himself. Most Nevada real estate and legal professionals who handled deals would not answer questions. A lawyer who reviewed paperwork for the lender, Michael Wixom, said only, “We file the UCC paperwork and represent the bank locally. It’s all consistent with Nevada state law, and it’s not unusual to not know the name of the owners.” Reporters sent questions about the identity-obscuring real estate sales to a public relations firm representing Trump in New York, the Trump Organization’s marketing vice president, its vice president of sales in Las Vegas and Eric Trump. None of the inquiries was answered. The deal in 2016 makes Milan Investment the third-biggest investor in the Vegas building, behind Trump’s own company and Hilton Hotels, which owns 311 of the condos. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert and professor at Washington University School of Law, said there’s a strong argument for requiring disclosure of anyone buying real estate from the president. “They’re doing it through Trump companies, but nevertheless, if it’s going to benefit the president, I think the public has a right to know who’s paying the president,” Clark said. One solution: making the president subject to the same rules as other public officials. USA TODAY’s review of sales of Trump-owned real estate found dozens of transactions during and since the campaign involving buyers who have business in or connections with foreign countries, or are shielded by purchasing under the name of an LLC. None of the recorded sales prices appeared, on the surface, to be outside market value. In February, businesswoman Xiao Yan Chen bought one of the president’s penthouses at Trump Park Avenue in Manhattan for $15.9 million, according to city records. Chen is founder and managing director of Global Alliance Associates, a New York City firm described on its website as “a boutique business relationship consultancy for U.S. companies seeking to establish a presence in mainland China.” She could not be reached for comment. A few days before Trump’s inauguration, a two-bedroom condo on the 55th floor of the Las Vegas tower sold for $639,000. The buyer of Condo No. 5507 is identified in deeds as Fashion Drive, a New York company named for the street below and formed days before the purchase. Pedestrians pass the Trump Park Avenue building May 31, 2016, in New York. (Photo: Frank Franklin II, AP) The only real person named in company's corporate filings in New York is Ivan Antonevich, a Ukrainian-educated pain doctor who did not reply to interview requests. It’s unclear whether he owns the condo, represents the buyer, or something else happened. As part of a federal crackdown on criminals using real estate to hide illicit cash, title insurance companies in a handful of U.S. cities must gather identity information and report all-cash deals above certain amounts to the government. Industry insiders said the opacity of most shell company real estate buys is for practical, legitimate reasons. “Privacy is a big driver of the LLCs, whether it’s celebrities protecting their privacy or foreign dissidents hiding assets from an oppressive government or law enforcement officers worried about their safety from criminals,” said Steve Gottheim, senior counsel at the American Land Title Association. Some investors in the Vegas building were easy to track down and willing to talk. One New York couple set up a company, SNJ Properties, to buy a unit in December. SNJ is owned by Susan and John Irwin of East Islip, N.Y., who bought a second condo in the building for vacation and as an investment. They said it didn’t have much to do with politics. “I’m a big fan of his, but the fact that Trump is president didn’t influence our decision,” said John Irwin, who owns Irwin Construction. Irwin, who met Trump at the hotel once, said he doesn’t worry about other people’s blind purchases of Trump’s real estate. “It doesn’t bother me. He’s a businessman, and that’s who we elected.” Trump’s leasable space in cities such as New York, Chicago and San Francisco bring in large sums as well. Commercial space at Trump Tower earned him almost $30 million in 2012, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to back up a loan Trump took out against the space. Among the revenue: multimillion-dollar lease payments from the communist government-owned Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. The Chinese bank’s lease is one of several transactions flagged in a lawsuit against Trump by an ethics watchdog group, alleging Trump violates the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which forbids government officials from taking gifts from foreign powers. The White House and Trump surrogates have broadly contended that the president is not involved in his business deals and scoff at the idea that a billionaire tycoon could be influenced by individual real estate transactions in the six- or seven-figure range. The USA TODAY review of publicly available records — including figures provided by the president himself — shows that his individual real estate transactions add up and have substantially driven his income in recent years. Consider the Vegas tower. In his federal financial disclosure in 2016, the income Trump said he received from the Vegas venture is more than the revenue he reported from all but one of his approximately 500 companies. USA TODAY’s analysis of the 2016 report indicates Trump’s income includes at least $100 million a year from real estate sales and lease transactions. That number is probably higher because companies’ income is reported in ranges spanning millions of dollars. Trump and his daughter Ivanka have reported drawing multimillion-dollar incomes from Trump International Realty in recent years. Trump’s financial disclosure reported about $4 million in commissions in 2016, and Jared Kushner’s disclosure reports his wife earns $1 million to $5 million a year in commissions and fees from the firm. At Trump properties across the country, more deals are ready to be made. “We’re selling quite a few of those now,” Ruffin said of the partners’ Vegas tower, where he and Trump own 388 condos and penthouses. “It’s picked up, our volume.” Ruffin owns an adjacent lot and is interested in building another tower and casino there, possibly partnering with the Trump Organization.

(Photo: Steve Reilly, USA TODAY) In total, records show Trump and his family own 32 residential condo units, plus 82 additional smaller units of real estate, including commercial property and storage spaces across New York City. That’s where the biggest money transactions are in the making. Trump’s realty company lists one of his three-bedroom condos on the seventh floor of Trump Park Avenue for $7 million, touting solid oak floors, handcrafted Italian brass doorknobs, marble baths and “a sleek gourmet chef’s kitchen.” Also for sale: a Trump-owned seven-bedroom penthouse on the 32nd floor. The $75,000-a-month rent gets you “360-degree views of New York City’s stunning landscape.” At 100 Central Park South, beneath the facade bearing the words “Trump Parc” in gold script, placards recently filled the windows advertising “RETAIL SPACE FOR LEASE.” The rent: $1.3 million a year. Joanne Podell, the listing agent for Cushman & Wakefield, said that although there has been recent interest, the building’s powerful owner is far less important in attracting tenants as factors like foot traffic and size. “It’s a great location."

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we. We're taking another look at our software and practices to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.
