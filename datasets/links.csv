Ryan a day after the retiring GOP leader broke with the president over granting U.S. citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil. “Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the [House] Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about! Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border!” Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. Trump contends the wording of the 14th Amendment, which grants the citizenship, gives him the authority. But Ryan said Tuesday ending the policy would require a Constitutional amendment. Also in Trump’s way is a 1952 law that codified the amendment into the federal canon. 25 Ratings Changes Less Than a Week Before Midterms The president said Monday he is mulling an order that would end the citizenship grant as a way, in his view, to remove a lure for undocumented migrants to come to the U.S. illegally. Democrats decried Trump’s threat, saying it is unconstitutional and merely an election-year ploy aimed at using an unattainable promise to fire up his conservative base in key House districts and Senate races. In another Wednesday tweet, the president acknowledged that if he does sign an order, the Supreme Court would inevitably have to settle a subsequent court battle. Trump and Ryan have clashed in the past, but mostly the two Republicans have had a functional working relationship. “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” the Wisconsin Republican said in an interview with WLVK while campaigning in Kentucky Tuesday. “As a conservative, I’m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution,” Ryan added. “And in this case, I think the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.” Amending the constitution involves the cooperation of either two-thirds of Congress or three-fourths of all states, neither is likely for changing birthright citizenship given the current political climate. Despite dismissing the process Trump proposed, Ryan was careful not to trample on the idea itself. “Where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here, which is unchecked illegal immigration,” the speaker said.

Politics Trump Sheds Light on His Legal Rationale for Ending Birthright Citizenship President Donald Trump on Wednesday signaled that his belief he can legally end U.S. citizenship for children born here is based on the interpretation of five words written in 1868. Democrats say the president is merely threatening to sign — as soon as this week — an executive order to end what’s called “birthright citizenship” as another way to energize his conservative base before Tuesday’s midterm elections. Such an order would surely prompt an immediate court challenge. Trump and his Republican allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, see automatic citizenship as a “magnet,” in Graham’s words, for undocumented migrants to get onto American soil and establish legal roots via an infant child. End birthright citizenship, Trump and his allies say, and illegal immigration rates will plummet. In a sign of a potential GOP internal struggle ahead, outgoing Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin says a constitutional amendment would be necessary. “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” states the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. [Midterm Barnstorming: Trump Channels Reagan] In a Wednesday morning tweet amid a national uproar over his Monday night announcement about the possible executive order, Trump highlighted five words within the amendment. “It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,’” he wrote, adding, “Many legal scholars agree.....” So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Many legal scholars agree.....  Should he ultimately sign such an order, the U.S. Supreme Court might decide if he is correct on the former. As for the latter, it’s true that “many” scholars disagree about most constitutional matters — but his mere claim could be enough to drive up conservative turnout in key districts and states. Trump’s goal is to limit Democratic gains in the House and pick up one or more seats in the Senate. And his every move is made with an eye toward his own expected 2020 re-election bid. The White House has yet to describe any internal legal assessment for Trump’s claims about the 14th Amendment and any power he might have to end birthright citizenship. But there also are questions about whether his order would be legal, since Congress passed a 1952 statute codifying automatic citizenship — which other Western countries have despite Trump’s false Monday night claim to the contrary — into law. Even conservative scholars who want birthright citizenship doubt that a sitting president can do it with the stroke of a pen on an executive order. “On substance, I believe President Trump is right on birthright citizenship — the 14th Amendment does not require it. I do not believe, however, that the president may change the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has been in effect for decades, by executive order, as he is reportedly contemplating,” Andrew C. McCarthy, a former chief assistant U.S. attorney, wrote this week for the conservative National Review. “I am in favor of changing the current understanding of birthright citizenship, but I believe such a change must be done by statute to have any hope of surviving court-scrutiny ... and even then, I give it less than a 50-50 chance,” he wrote. In another tweet Wednesday morning, the president acknowledged a long court fight would be ahead, saying the matter would ultimately head to the Supreme Court. ....Harry Reid was right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) “stuff.” Don’t forget the nasty term Anchor Babies.

Donnelly Wins Dirksen Award  CQ Roll Call senior writer John M. Donnelly has won the Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for Distinguished Reporting of Congress for his coverage of national security and foreign policy. The Dirksen Award, presented by the National Press Foundation, is given annually to a journalist whose reporting gives insight into Congress and “represents the highest standards of journalism.” Donnelly is the 20th journalist to have worked at CQ or Roll Call to win the award. “Donnelly’s reporting demonstrates outstanding mastery of the defense beat,” the judges said. “He methodically hammers away at questionable defense spending and Pentagon assertions through painstaking reporting on legislation and military arcana.” He won the prize with stories that dove into defense and oversight issues, including a look at how defense hawks in Congress were misleading when they said a spike in deadly accidents in 2017 involving U.S. military ships and planes was part of a pattern of rising wrecks that required higher spending. Donnelly also reported on lawmakers continuing to fund a pricey class of high-tech destroyers. On a quick deadline, he covered an obscure Pentagon fund that became a catchall for lawmakers’ pet projects after the ban on earmarks took effect. Donnelly has covered his beat for CQ Roll Call since 2004. He previously was a reporter and editor for 10 years at Defense Week, a newsletter that covered the Pentagon and defense industry. He has also written on national security issues for other publications, including The Economist and the Los Angeles Times. “John shines a light in dark corners and exposes themes and trends that deserve much more attention,” CQ editor and vice president Catalina Camia said. His stories “show how lawmakers take care of their own political interests, whether or not it serves the public good.” Donnelly will receive the award and a $5,000 prize at the National Press Foundation dinner on Feb. 13.

Politics Senate Republicans Schedule Leadership Elections Win, lose or draw on Election Day, the Senate Republican Conference has formally scheduled leadership elections for the 116th Congress for the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 14. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is the only member of the Republican leadership not facing a conference-imposed term limit on his role. Barring something unforeseen, the Kentuckian is set to lead his conference for the fifth consecutive congress. The 76 year-old McConnell became the longest serving leader of the Republican Conference in June — he was minority leader from 2007 to 2015. Whatever the election results on Nov. 6, McConnell can boast of two confirmed Supreme Court justices under President Donald Trump, 29 appellate judges and dozens of district judges in the last two years. He also shepherded an overhaul of the tax code. His sole flop was falling short, by one vote, of repealing the 2010 health care law. Meanwhile, the odd man out will be Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, whose term as whip expires at the end of the year and is subject to term limits. Sliding into the whip’s role is expected to be Sen. John Thune. The South Dakota Republican, who has been serving as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference as well as the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, will take an even more prominent role in both the messaging and policy operations. Thune was re-elected in 2016, the year that Trump overwhelmingly carried his state. He first arrived in the Senate back in 2005 as something of a Republican hero, having unseated Democratic Leader Tom Daschle in the 2004 election. Also moving up is Sen. John Barrasso, the Wyoming senator who has been overseeing the Republican Policy Committee, which produces policy briefs and research for GOP offices. He has also played a key policy messaging role, particularly on Republican opposition to the 2010 health care overhaul and their many ill-fated repeal efforts, as well as regulatory policy through his chairmanship of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Barrasso was elected to the Wyoming Senate in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2007, after Republican Craig Thomas died.

Harry Reid responded to President Donald Trump after the president invoked his past support for repealing birthright citizenship. The former Senate majority leader and Democrat from Nevada long ago reversed his position on the issue, but Trump said in a Wednesday morning tweet, “Harry Reid was right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) ‘stuff.’” Reid bit back at that tweet. “In 1993, around the time Donald Trump was gobbling up tax-free inheritance money from his wealthy father and driving several companies into bankruptcy, I made a mistake,” Reid said in a statement. His wife Landra was immediately critical of “that awful bill,” Reid said referring to his immigration legislation. He said Landra pointed out that her own father had been an immigrant. “And in my 36 years in Washington, there is no more valuable lesson I learned than the strength and power of immigrants and no issue and I worked harder on than fixing our broken immigration system,” Reid said. “I had the privilege of learning from heroes like Astrid Silva who came to this nation as a little girl and has emerged as a powerful leader.” Silva is a leading DREAMer who has become a fixture in Nevada politics, and much of Reid’s political apparatus is now rooted in the Silver State’s Hispanic population. Trump tweeted about Reid again Wednesday afternoon, linking to a clip of a Senate floor speech from back when he was supportive of overturning citizenship rights for children born on U.S. soil to foreign nationals.  Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship! pic.twitter.com/ypiE1QWKag  As for Trump, Reid said, “He can tweet whatever he wants while he sits around watching TV, but he is profoundly wrong.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

These 4 Siblings All Work in Congress What has four siblings, two parties and five careers at the Capitol? The Hervig family. And don’t even get them started on Thanksgiving. “We probably argue more about turkey bacon versus bacon bacon” than politics, says the eldest, Daniel. Another sibling chimes in with a slightly different take. “They have been fighting since the day Janelle came out from the womb,” she says. She’s looking at her brother and her sister Janelle Relfe, who works for Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. Both are legislative directors. “She’s a Republican just to get back at me,” adds Daniel, a Democrat. “Honestly, their parents are all very proud of all four of them,” says the other Republican in this raucous group, Mitch Relfe. He’s Janelle’s husband and (wait for it) a legislative director too. That’s just like Mitch — always “the diplomat,” says Mary Beth Hervig. She and her younger sister, Angela, may be at the beginning of their careers, but they can hold their own, even among the crosstalk of a boisterous family interview. “Just know I’m the favorite, and I tie the siblings together as the baby. They all nurture me, so it softens them up when we talk politics,” says Angela, 22. She’s an intern for House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland. As for Mary Beth, she’s 23 and a staff assistant for yet another Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan F. Boyle. “It’s funny because whenever you say, ‘My sister and my brother-in-law are Republicans,’ the first thing out of everyone’s mouth is always, ‘What’s Thanksgiving like?’” she says. But Thanksgiving for the Hervig family is no different from any other day, or so they insist. “It’s not like your standard [situation] where families … see each other on Thanksgiving so they’re like, ‘Oh, we’re gonna bring up the president.’ Because we live and breathe it, we always are talking about it,” says Janelle, 31. It’s not like their parents are particularly political. While their mom and stepfather are moderates, with the former leaning Democratic, their father and stepmother are Republicans. “Most people think I’m a Republican when they first meet me on the Hill until we start talking about politics,” says Daniel, 33, who works for Michigan’s 13th District, previously held by John Conyers Jr. “It’s that really clean cut — ” jokes Mitch. “— now that you all grow beards, I guess,” Daniel shoots back. As the banter flies, I can barely keep up. But Mitch, who works for Alabama Rep. Bradley Byrne, embraces the family split. “We’ve appreciated getting to know Daniel’s friends. When you’re working as a staffer up here, things have to be basically bipartisan to get things done. I think it’s kind of nice having a bipartisan family network,” he says. Janelle adds, “When I meet people who know Daniel, I have to redeem myself, but I have no idea what he told them about me.” She and Daniel paved the way for the other siblings in D.C. “Even though we didn’t have political parents, they’re ten years older,” Mary Beth says. “— we’re kind of your political parents,” Janelle interjects. Mary Beth adds, “So we did have an older political influence. It made us really interested in politics at a younger age.” Janelle first came to Capitol Hill in 2010 to work for former Rep. Jim DeMint of South Carolina. Daniel came a year later, after he graduated law school, to work for Democratic Sen. Al Franken. The contrast isn’t lost on Mitch. “On top of the DeMint, Franken split, I mean she is [now] an LD for Jeb Henserling and he was a LD for John Conyers, that’s like a —” “That’s pretty much as far as you can get,” Janelle says. “Did we ever co-sponsor a bill together?” Daniel asks Janelle. “Probably not,” she laughs. Mitch entered the mix in 2010, when he and Janelle met in the run-up to former Sen. Scott Brown’s special election in Boston. While he’s from Alabama, the Hervig siblings call South Carolina home. Meanwhile, the youngest Hervigs were already dipping their toes in politics. When the 2008 Republican presidential primary debate was in Myrtle Beach, Mary Beth and Angela went to the venue and joined a group that was pushing for climate change policies. They were barely teenagers at the time. Now the whole family is on the Hill. Angela started her internship in Hoyer’s office just last month. Mary Beth got her start in Conyers office in 2017, working for her brother, and did a stint in Hoyer’s office too. “She interned with me. I wanted to make sure she learned the ropes the right way,” Daniel says. “We kind of talk for them sometimes. They’re like our kids,” Janelle says. Daniel adds, “You have to hold the floor in our household. Your time is not very respected. You have to hold it, and if you don’t, you don’t talk.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Mark Sanford Won’t Endorse GOP Candidate for His Seat Outgoing South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford will pack up his House office in January, but not before sending a message. Sanford will not endorse his Republican primary rival Katie Arrington in her bid for his 1st District seat, he confirmed to the Post and Courier on Monday. “Part of leadership, at times, means knowing when it’s best to keep quiet,” Sanford told the paper. “To me, this is probably one of those times.” Sanford’s stance comes days before Election Day, as Arrington faces an unusually competitive contest in what is supposed to be a slam-dunk district for the GOP. In her matchup against Democrat Joe Cunningham, Nathan L. Gonzales rates the district Solid Republican. Still, the National Republican Congressional Committee dropped $87,000 into the district this week, calling attention to the race. In a bruising primary battle, Arrington successfully challenged Sanford, a member of the deeply conservative Freedom Caucus, from the right. Support for President Donald Trump proved to be a decisive fault line. Arrington appealed to the Trump’s base, while Sanford was an occasional thorn in the president’s side on cable news. For example, he staked out opposition to Trump’s divisive and sometimes violent rhetoric in the wake of the shooting at the Republican team’s congressional baseball practice last year. He said the president’s verbal attacks were “partially” to blame for the country’s fierce political divisions. Trump endorsed Arrington on Election Day. “Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina,” Trump tweeted. Trump mocked Sanford’s subsequent defeat at a private meeting with Congressional Republicans. Sanford bristled that the president would pick on him given that on policy, they closely align. To “shoot at a guy you’ve already shot and killed, is perplexing and unfortunate,” Sanford said to the Post and Courier at the time. “If you were to pick a group of folks who have been most aligned and most supportive of the president’s agenda, it would in fact be the Freedom Caucus.” Sanford has occasionally diverged from the party line though, most notably on climate change. “I believe human activity is having a measurable effect on the environment,” he wrote in a 2007 Washington Post op-ed. Offshore drilling was a defining issue during the primary. Arrington distinguished herself from Sanford by offering full-throated support for the president’s plan to allow for offshore oil and natural gas drilling in federal waters off the Atlantic Coast, referring to the rule change as an “America First policy of true American energy independence.” Sanford was an outspoken opponent. Arrington has since reversed her position. The 1st District stretches alongside state’s Lowcountry shoreline, which will face more flooding, shoreline erosion and loss of coastal wetlands as global temperatures rise, according to the Coastal Conservation League, a South Carolina environmental group.

Mia Love The Federal Elections Commission is not finished reviewing Rep. Mia Love’s campaign fundraising, according to an from the FEC to a liberal group that filed a complaint against her for alleged violations. The Salt Lake Tribune first reported this story. The Utah Republican had claimed the opposite to reporters earlier in October, publicly releasing an email from an FEC representative saying Love’s campaign committee could retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in primary-designated campaign donations it raked in ahead of the GOP’s nominating convention on April 21. But the FEC’s note to Love mentioned nothing of more than $350,000 in primary-designated funds Love continued to raise up until Utah’s primary election on June 30, in which she was on the ballot unopposed. Now, in its new email Tuesday to the progressive Alliance for a Better Utah, the FEC has reiterated that the group’s complaint against Love “remains pending before the Commission.” The FEC’s communications with Love “were not in connection” with the Alliance’s complaint, but rather a formal request by Love’s campaign committee for additional information on the status of its fundraising, the letter states. “You will be advised when the Commission takes final action on your complaint,” the FEC wrote to the Alliance. The race for Love’s seat in Utah’s 4th District is one of the closest in the country with Democratic nominee and Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams leading the incumbent in one poll and tied with her in two others this month, according to Real Clear Politics. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up. Love’s campaign has told the Tribune that it has reallocated or refunded all of the $1 million it raised for the primary race she never faced as an extra precaution while admitting no wrongdoing. Love’s campaign had previously agreed to re-designate $370,000 raised for general election purposes during the window between the nominating convention and the primary. She has also refunded $29,000 in campaign contributions, her third-quarter FEC filing shows.

Politics Claire McCaskill Defines ‘Crazy Democrats’ for Fox News One week before the midterm elections, Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill has tried to distance herself from the most liberal elements of her party, including high-profile progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. McCaskill refrained from grouping Sanders or Warren in with the “crazy Democrats” her campaign distanced her from in a radio ad last week. But, in an interview with Fox News on Monday, she invoked their names when asked if any of her colleagues were “crazy Democrats.” “I would not call my colleagues crazy, but Elizabeth Warren sure went after me when I advocated tooling back some of the regulations for small banks and credit unions,” McCaskill said. Warren has long been an advocate for tighter restrictions on banks after the housing and financial crisis of 2007-2008. She excoriated Republicans and “far too many Democrats” for rolling back segments of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that slapped regulations on banks after the financial crisis. In her Fox interview, McCaskill also mentioned Sanders, a Vermont independent, as a Democrat with a large following from whom she is not afraid to distance herself. McCaskill, one of 10 Democratic Senate incumbents running for re-election this year in a state Trump won in 2016, is locked in a tight battle with GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley. McCaskill trailed Hawley, 49 percent to 45 percent, among likely voters in a poll released last week by Missouri Scout. Hawley’s edge fell within the survey’s margin of error. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race Tilts Republican. In a radio advertisement from McCaskill’s campaign last week, a narrator assured voters that the senator is “not one of those crazy Democrats.” Who are those, exactly? “The crazy Democrats are people who walk in restaurants and scream in elected officials’ faces,” McCaskill said in the Fox interview, referring to two separate incidents in which progressive activists have spontaneously begun shouting at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz while they were dining. “We have a state senator here in Missouri that actually advocated for the assassination of President Trump. That’s a crazy Democrat,” McCaskill said. Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal was reprimanded for the comment. “I don’t do those things,” McCaskill said. “I am not somebody who thinks that we should ever be uncivil.” Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics The Last of the Gingrich Revolutionaries It was nearly 24 years ago that Republicans swept into power in stunning fashion, ending 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. But those 73 new Republicans who came to the House and 11 who came to the Senate on the 1994 wave engineered by Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich and his “Contract with America” have now dwindled down to a handful, and after this election only seven will likely be left in Congress. For his part, Gingrich, a supporter of President Donald Trump, doesn’t see this as the end of an era, but a continuation of a revolution that began in 1964, with presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator. “I think we were the natural evolution that went Goldwater, Reagan, ’94 Contract, Trump,” he said. “I think there’s a very natural evolution of those things.” Two members of the Class of 1994 are retiring this year: New Jersey Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. In January, the two likely remaining continuously serving GOP House members will be Reps. Mac Thornberry of Texas and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the latter of whom has said the 2018 election will be his last. Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, another 1994 alum, lost in 2008, but won back his seat two years later in a rematch. Thornberry and Jones are both in races rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Chabot, however, faces a competitive re-election against Democrat Aftab Pureval in the 1st District, which Inside Elections rates Leans Republican. Three current Republican senators started their careers in the House in 1995: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma has served continuously in the Senate since 1995. Of the four, Wicker is the only one up for re-election this year, bidding for a second full Senate term. Inside Elections rates his race against Democrat David Baria, the state House minority leader, Solid Republican. Burr won a third Senate term two years ago after announcing it would be his last. Back in 2014, Gingrich lamented what had become of his caucus. At a reunion of the Class of 1994, he said, “The fact that we do not have positive themes and positive issues is going to cost us seats this fall.” As it turned out, Republicans picked up 13 seats in the House that year and retook control of the Senate.

They haven’t since 2003. This week, just 13 days before the midterm elections on Nov. 6, that did not change. The legislative branch’s most recent approval rating — 14 percent — was actually up compared to recent months, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday. Remember, the GOP has a majority in both chambers of Congress, so you might reasonably expect at least a chunk of conservative Americans to look favorably on their elected leaders. But even among the 370 Republicans surveyed via web-based interviewing from Oct. 21 through Oct. 23, just 31 percent approved of “the way that the United States Congress is handling its job.” Among independents, that number dropped to 9 percent. And among Democrats? Just 6 percent, with 74 percent disapproving. From the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, Congress’ approval rating hovered somewhere in the 34 to 38 percent range, at times in the late-’80s peeking up above the 40 percent threshold, according to historic Gallup poll numbers. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress’ approval rating soared to 84 percent. It hovered in the 50 to 60 percent range for about a year as politicians grappled with their response to terrorist elements in the Middle East. But that approval number steadily declined in subsequent years, finally reaching a low point of 9 percent in November 2013. Two main factors have contributed to Congress’ plummet in public opinion, said Stella Rouse, a political science professor at the University of Maryland: heightened polarization between the two parties and crippling legislative gridlock. “Nothing gets done,” said Rouse, the director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship. “People have a pretty strong perception that that is the case — that Congress is do-nothing over the past several years.” Rouse noted that while Americans tend to harbor negative feelings toward Congress as a whole, that doesn’t extend to their own congressmen and congresswomen. Americans rarely “ascribe blame to their personal congress person,” Rouse said. “It’s easier to ascribe it to the institution.” More broadly, the same goes for party leaders. Sixty-two percent of Republicans surveyed in the YouGov poll had at least a somewhat favorable view of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, numbers that have received a boost since the Kentucky Republican helped guide Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh through a contentious confirmation process. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans viewed Speaker Paul D. Ryan favorably. On the Democratic side, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi boasted a 60 percent favorability rating in her own party, while her senatorial complement, Charles E. Schumer of New York, clung to 50 percent favorability. “Those are majorities, but some of those numbers aren’t all that high,” Rouse said. She, again, attributed those relatively deflated intraparty approval ratings to legislative gridlock. “Because party leaders can’t get a lot done right now, those numbers are lower than they are historically,” Rouse said. With midterms less than two weeks away, the electorate will soon determine the fate of its leadership in Congress. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to regain a majority in the House. In the Senate, the electoral map favors Republicans. Ten Democratic incumbents from states won by President Donald Trump are up for re-election this cycle. YouGov surveyed a random sample of 1,500 U.S. adults stratified by age, gender, race, education and region. The poll’s margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.8 percent. The poll is conducted in concert with the Economist, which holds the largest share of Roll Call’s parent company, FiscalNote. What Year Is It? Trump’s Midterm Rallies Are Mostly About His 2020 Re-Election Bid Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Word on the Hill: What’s Buzzing on Capitol Hill? Trump: Midterms — Not Tariffs — to Blame for Sluggish Market Republicans Poised to Stand by Trump, Win or Lose Politics America Is at a Midterm Crossroads. Let Us Count the Ways Next week’s elections will not only determine the balance of power on Capitol Hill but also will seal the fate of the Trump administration’s legislative agenda for the next two years and set the landscape of the 2020 presidential campaigns. The direction of the nation’s most contentious and consequential issues — health care, immigration, taxes, climate change, trade, gun control, ethics and campaign finance overhauls and oversight of the administration — hinges on what voters decide Nov. 6. The stakes are enormous. If Democrats capture control of just one chamber of Congress, most likely the House, they can deny President Donald Trump and their GOP colleagues their legislative wish list, slamming shut the window for a new round of tax cuts or divisive changes to entitlement programs. With the subpoena power that comes with a committee gavel, House Democrats will kick-start Congress’ largely dormant oversight role, probing everything from the president’s hidden personal tax returns to the administration’s handling of health care and financial regulations, as well as its response to hurricanes, the Russian election interference investigation and other international crises. With control of the House, Democrats could push along legislation on pivotal matters, such as rescuing or expanding parts of the 2010 health care law, raising the federal minimum wage and addressing gun control, ethics in government and political money issues. Those bills wouldn’t likely make their way into law even if the party wins control of the Senate — the president has veto power after all. But it would allow Democrats to lay out an alternative policy vision, incubating proposals that the party’s 2020 White House hopefuls could embrace, or reject. “In many ways, the House Democrats are going to determine in those first 100 days what the common platform of the 2020 presidential candidates will be,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “What we pass on the House side, even if it doesn’t become law, will become the mantra of the presidential candidates.”  It won’t be all harmony within the Democratic caucus. The party will need to resolve its leadership lineup and will contend with an emboldened progressive wing at the same time it needs to show voters proof that it can once again govern. Though less likely than taking the House, Democrats taking the Senate in the 116th Congress could intensify pressure on the executive branch through oversight investigations and efforts to block administration goals — think border wall, for example — through the appropriations process. Most importantly, they could hold up or even block Trump’s judicial and executive branch nominees. Also Watch: Initial Early Voting Data Appears to Favor GOP in Several Key States On the flip side, if Republicans maintain control of Congress, the election results would serve as an endorsement of the Trump-GOP agenda and embolden the party to carry on with more tax cuts and conservative appointees, changes to welfare programs and a hard-line approach to immigration and border enforcement. In a Democrat-controlled House or Senate, the biggest concern for Republicans on the Hill and their conservative allies outside Congress isn’t that the other party will wield the power over the next two years to enact progressive or any other kind of major legislation. Instead it’s about the potential for dashed hopes, lost opportunities and the end of what many conservatives felt should have been the midpoint, not the end, of a stretch of policy victories, including more tax cuts and regulatory overhauls. “We didn’t accomplish as much as we wanted to in these first two years,” said Tim Chapman, executive director of the conservative Heritage Action for America, the lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation. “We didn’t get where we wanted to on fixing the health care system or welfare reform. … You don’t know that you’re going to get that window again in 2020.” With either chamber of Congress in Democratic hands, Republicans will face other fears: that Trump could morph into more of a liberal on signature issues such as funding infrastructure projects, possibly flipping on their policy priorities to start cobbling together deals with Democratic leaders. Congressional Republicans could also lose the already flighty focus of their president who, when it comes to trade policy, often sounds more like the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party than any faction of the GOP. Still, one of the biggest questions, if Democrats hold the power in either chamber, remains: Can they work with a president whom their voters despise, especially when it’s the left’s angry and motivated base that will have helped catapult the party back into power? “The president is tacking towards the center in everything but his rhetoric,” said John Feehery, a former congressional Republican leadership aide, who is now a partner at the lobbying shop EFB Advocacy. “Democrats are tacking further to the left because they don’t like his rhetoric.”  The new free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a renegotiation of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, includes tougher protections for workers, something Democrats have called for. “There’s a lot in there that Democrats should like,” Feehery said. “But do they want to give the president a victory?” Celeste Drake, trade policy specialist with the AFL-CIO, said congressional Democrats are “still coalescing” when it comes to the new deal, which would require Congress’ approval. Trade, of course, is an issue that splits the party’s few free-traders with the majority of the caucus, which is largely skeptical of the impact of big trade deals on jobs and workers’ pay. Drake said the new deal’s stronger labor provisions sound appealing but isn’t sure how they’d be enforced. The president’s language about the new agreement also leaves Democrats uncomfortable. “His rhetoric on NAFTA has been very xenophobic,” she said. “How does that square with the Democrats who have long been calling for a NAFTA reform? … Democrats will be looking to put a stamp on this and to address those issues.” Democrats, in power in either the House or the Senate, will also look to put their stamp on health care and prescription drug matters. If voters often accuse politicians of flip-flopping on a policy, lawmakers have seen much of the electorate do an about-face on the 2010 health care law, which cost Democrats their House majority in that year’s elections. Now quite the opposite has popped up on the campaign trail. Instead of vilifying lawmakers for the law, a majority of voters in some of the country’s tightest electoral contests want to preserve at least its protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is up for re-election this year, said keeping in place those protections as well as measures to bring down pharmaceutical prices have become huge rallying points on the campaign trail, in Democrats’ favor. On the pharmaceutical prices, she said, “I’m excited about that because I’m the lead on a bunch of those bills” and the discussion of those matters on the campaign trail “will really help to finally propel that issue into next year.” Trump has also signaled his interest in reining in drug prices. Immigration, however, offers a stark contrast between the two parties and between congressional Democrats and the president. “I’m hoping we win all these seats, and that will be a big pushback on some of the rhetoric there, and maybe we can then move on comprehensive reform,” Klobuchar adds. Republicans have also worked to differentiate themselves from Democrats on style and rhetoric, not just policy. The GOP is stoking fears about unruly mobs of leftists taking over Washington. “We got a little preview of what life would be like here in the United States Capitol with Democrats in charge, if they’re successful in capturing one or both houses of the Congress after the midterm elections: angry mobs, intimidation, showing up at people’s homes, mailing them coat hangers, and trying to intimidate members,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas told reporters in the Capitol after the debate over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “That’s not exactly my ideal of how the United States Congress should operate.” The debate over civility has taken a scary turn in recent days with suspected explosive devices turning up in the mail to several prominent Democrats including some sitting lawmakers. In the House, if Democrats control the chamber, a vocal group of incumbents, including House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, along with some of the likely stars of the incoming freshman class, have called for the new majority’s top priority and first order of legislative business to be a far-reaching overhaul of the nation’s campaign finance, voting rights, lobbying and ethics laws. “All of these items should be packaged, in my opinion, into one reform bill and addressed in the opening days of the next Congress,” Hoyer said recently. “Democrats, if entrusted with the leadership will do exactly that. ... If Democrats can fix government we can earn the trust of voters to lead on addressing health care, infrastructure, jobs, the environment and so many other critical issues.” Hoyer’s endorsement of such a measure is significant. It’s the kind of talking point one would expect from Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, not Hoyer, who enjoys a friendly rapport with the nation’s business community and has a long list of former aides in the K Street lobbying corridor. A major campaign finance, lobbying, ethics and anti-corruption package would not pass the Senate, but the proposal would allow Democrats to deliver, in the House, a platform for the party, including those running for president in 2020. “We’ll be creating a new baseline of what Democrats stand for,” said Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland, who chairs the House Democrats’ Democracy Reform Task Force. He said his party has big ideas on immigration, health care, gun control and a number of other issues. But first, he said, “You have to establish this idea that you’re unrigging the system.” Democrats can’t fight pharmaceutical companies on drug prices if the party is beholden to the industry’s donations, he said. More than 100 Democratic challengers have called on the party’s House leaders to embrace the idea. One of them is Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative who is running to unseat Republican Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. “When we look at issues that are as great as education and health care and the cost of prescription drug prices and criminal justice reform, every piece of those issues does link back to what is the driving force behind legislation that’s coming out of Washington, what’s the driving force behind the purpose of those efforts whatever they may be,” Spanberger said during a recent phone call with reporters. “And I think that it’s up to us to take every action necessary to ensure that voters believe that it’s about them.” Democrats share common policy priorities, of course, but if such an overhaul is the first order of business, it will quickly expose some of the rifts within the caucus. Khanna said he expects the Progressive Caucus’ membership to serve as the party’s “fountain and engine for ideas” should Democrats reclaim the House. Early priorities could include, he said, a Medicare-for-all style of health care, a vote on an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a $1 trillion infrastructure package to spur new jobs and improve the country’s roads, airports and rails. Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, said the tack Congress takes doesn’t just depend on whether Democrats win control of the House or Senate, but by how much. If the party comes in on a wave, then it will feel the pressure to take up big issues such as Medicare-for-all, rolling back the Republican tax breaks and addressing climate change and immigration. If they barely take control, the ambition could be lessened. Regardless, Marshall said such issues as data privacy legislation could gain momentum in the next Congress: “There’s a growing feeling in the country that we need rules for privacy, to protect people’s personal information.” Rep. Scott Peters of California, who heads the moderate New Democrat Coalition PAC, said there are issues on which Democrats of all persuasions agree, including protecting the so-called Dreamers, who came to the United States as undocumented minors; new campaign finance disclosures; and measures to ensure that all gun buyers are subject to background checks. “I think it’s pretty obvious to all of us where we agree and that we agree a lot more than we disagree,” Peters said. When it comes to possibly working with the president, he isn’t sure what to expect. “In two years, I haven’t seen a lot of interest on their side in doing that,” Peters said of the White House. He noted that the president has been “insulting to Democrats,” adding, “I don’t take any of that personally” and saying he’d work with the administration if it’s interested in tackling policies of interest in his district. For his part, Trump said during an October appearance on Fox News that he believes Republicans will remain in charge of Congress. “And if we’re not, if we lose the majority in the House, which is always a possibility, we will probably just have to fight it out,” he said, adding that there are “a lot of haters” in the Democratic Party. “Now, can we get along? Maybe. And there’s a possibility. They want infrastructure, I want infrastructure; there’s something that can bring us together. We have a lot of things where there is commonality and it’s possible that we’ll even get along.” Bipartisan collaboration between congressional Democrats and the president offers an intriguing possibility: Democrats could well be attacking the president with their investigative power — and certainly some will call for his impeachment — at the same time they try to strike legislative bargains with Trump. “We would finally see what we’ve been promised the last year and a half: Infrastructure Week,” said Democratic lobbyist Anne Urban, who is with the K Street firm Urban Swirski & Associates. At the same time, “Democrats have been really smart about keeping their powder dry on impeachment. But there’s going to be a whole lot of time spent doing investigations, and probably rightfully so. There hasn’t been anything close to exhaustive investigations done.” Even some on the conservative, libertarian side say they welcome more oversight from Capitol Hill as a way to balance out executive power, which has been on the rise in recent administrations by presidents of both political parties. “I welcome oversight of government programs, regardless of what letter goes behind the name of the chairman,” said Kent Lassman, who runs the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. Matt Mackowiak, president of the Potomac Strategy Group, sees a political upside, eventually, to a House Democratic majority. “I do believe they move to impeach the president in the first 90 days,” he predicted. That, along with a full slate of investigations, he said, “will help Trump get re-elected.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics Trump Campaign’s Final Midterms Ad: ‘Future ... Not Guaranteed’ The Trump campaign announced a $6 million midterms closing argument television ad blitz that will try to convince voters they are better off than they were before President Donald Trump took office. But it excludes some facts. “When I look at how things are, it reminds me of how far we’ve come,” a woman says at the start of the minute-long ad as a mother helps her young daughter put on her backpack. The ad then plays television news footage of anchors and reporters talking about the then-floundering U.S. economy — in 2010. Watch: New Trump Ad Declares The Future ‘Isn’t Guaranteed’ [Fact check: The economy had rebounded — though via slow but steady growth under President Barack Obama — by the time Trump secured the GOP presidential nomination in the summer of 2016.] “But things are starting to change. There’s more opportunity and security to invest in the ones that matter,” the narrator says. “But this can all go away if we don’t remember what we came from and choose the right future. Because the future we’re fighting for is not guaranteed.” [Fact check: The economic collapse began not under Democrat Obama in 2010, but under another Republican president, George W. Bush, in 2007 then intensifying into what became known as the “Great Recession” in 2008. But the ad never mentions the specific timeline of the slowdown.] The ad — which also offers a preview of his 2020 reelection pitch — matches part of the president’s campaign-trail closing pitch that handing Democrats control of the House and/or Senate would hit average Americans in their bank accounts. At recent rallies, Trump has warned Democrats would bring higher taxes and health care changes that would created new costs of Americans. He also argues Democrats want to give federal benefits to undocumented migrants at the expense of American citizens. [Fact check: The president’s claims about Democrats and migrant benefits are delivered without evidence and appear mostly false.] Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android. Politics Trump to Focus on Midwestern Battlegrounds in Final Midterms Tour President Donald Trump will hit eight states with 11 campaign rallies in the final six days of the midterm election cycle with the House and Senate — and most of his domestic agenda — up for grabs. Trump was in Washington on Monday and will remain there until Wednesday, when he will begin his final push to convince voters to keep both chambers in Republican hands. His tour will mostly focus on Midwestern and Mid-Southern battlegrounds. A person familiar with the president’s plans said he will begin an “ambitious” barnstorming effort Wednesday night in Fort Myers, Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is trying to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, and former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis is trying to defeat Tallahassee Democratic Mayor Andrew Gillum in that state’s gubernatorial fight. On Monday morning, Trump called Gillum a “thief” in a tweet, a sign he’s taking the gloves back off after a deadly shooting Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue led him to admittedly tone down his tough talk about Democrats at a rally that night. In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!  On Thursday, he will jet to Columbia, Missouri, to stump for Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley, who has opened a lead over incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Watch: New Trump Ad Declares The Future ‘Isn’t Guaranteed’ During the campaign’s final three days, the president will pick up the pace. He intends to hold multiple rallies per day, as he did during his 2016 presidential campaign. On Friday, his first stop will be West Virginia for a rally in Huntington for state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is trying to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III. Manchin’s vote for controversial Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, experts say, might be enough to keep that seat blue. But Trump has been there several times and still views the West Virginia Democrat as vulnerable. That night, he will be in Indianapolis, where polls show Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in trouble against Republican Mike Braun, a businessman and former state representative. He will be in Florida again Saturday night with a Pensacola event. The same day, he will head to Montana to try to put state Auditor Matt Rosendale over the top in his race to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The president will start Sunday in Macon, Georgia, to try and help GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp win the governor’s race. Then he will take Air Force One to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Rep. Marsha Blackburn has opened a lead for the seat her fellow Republican, Sen. Bob Corker, is vacating. It’s then back to Indiana — Fort Wayne, this time — on Monday as the first of three rallies. Cape Girardeau, Missouri, is the second stop — a sign Trump and GOP leaders do not want that seat to remain blue. He will wrap up the final day of campaigning in Cleveland, Ohio, where Republican Attorney General (and former senator) Mike DeWine is locked in a close race for governor with Democrat Richard Cordray. The Buckeye State is also home to a Senate contest this year, though GOP Rep. James B. Renacci is currently running far behind incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. In a way, Trump’s final 2018 appearance will mark the unofficial start of his 2020 re-election bid. That’s because Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales lists the Brown-Renacci race as Solid Democratic. But a big win by Brown is seen as a potential springboard to a 2020 presidential bid. The barnstorming tour is part of Trump’s aggressive midterms homestretch sprint. Last week, he held rallies in several states that feature close races, including Texas, Wisconsin, Illinois and North Carolina. Trump’s closing argument is built on the same stump speech he’s been delivering lately at rallies and official events alike. It features his usual ticking off of what he sees as his accomplishments in office — but with amplified rhetoric and warnings about a perceived leftward lunge by the Democratic Party and its 2018 slate of candidates. The GOP president regularly warns supporters at rallies about Democrats eager to grab control of the House and Senate so they can alter immigration policy to allow a greater “flow” of migrants into the country — on Monday, he tweeted that a caravan making its way from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border was an approaching “invasion” force. Trump offers these warnings without supporting evidence to prove they are anything but something intended to fire up his base and limit GOP losses by driving up turnout in key House races while possibly picking up a seat or two in the Senate. At his rallies, the president also contends that giving Democrats more power would ensure higher taxes and changes to social programs like Social Security. He often omits to mention that he holds the power to veto any such legislation Congress sends him and that no political forecaster sees Democrats holding the requisite number of seats in either chamber to override him.

Politics Marijuana Ballot Measures Could Drive Democratic Voters, But Candidates Aren’t Running On It Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ memo in January urging state officials to enforce federal marijuana laws has not stalled momentum toward decriminalization across the country. Four states will vote on pot proposals in November. For years, the Democratic Party has hoped marijuana ballot initiatives will motivate their voters to turn out. The theory is far from settled political science, but anecdotal evidence this cycle looks optimistic for embattled Democrats, even as they offer only meek support for the initiatives on the campaign trail. One state to watch in particular: North Dakota. Voters in North Dakota will weigh recreational use, where Democrats support legalization at a higher rate than Republicans do, according to the Brookings Institute. A boost in youth turnout could prove crucial to incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who faces a neck-and-neck re-election challenge against Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer in a race Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates Tilts Republican. Voters will weigh whether to allow recreational marijuana use and retail sales, and whether to expunge and seal the criminal records of adjudicated defendants convicted of any marijuana-related crime, according to the Bismark Tribune. Beyond that, the measure includes few details, imposing no limit on possession. “This [measure] is basically a referendum,” Dave Owen, chairman of the North Dakota Marijuana Legalization Initiative, told the paper. “Do you want recreational marijuana? Yes or no.” And if Morton County is typical, Measure 3 could be mobilizing voters. Morton, one of the most populous counties in North Dakota, has seen a spike in applications for absentee ballots, according to another Bismark Tribune report. “Staff members who have been here longer than me don’t remember receiving this many, this early,” Morton County Auditor Dawn Rhone told the paper in September, attributing the energy to the Senate race and Measure 3. But Heitkamp has largely tiptoed on the issue on the campaign trail, as Marijuana Moment, an online magazine in favor of legalization, has reported. Heitkamp tweeted in February that U.S. Department of Justice “shouldn’t be getting in the way” of state decriminalization efforts, but offered only tacit support for Measure 3 in an interview with a Bismark television station in August, saying she shares law enforcement’s concerns. More recently, Heitkamp’s office would not confirm her position to a West Fargo Pioneer opinion writer. In Michigan, Proposal 1 would allow for retail sales of marijuana for recreational use and add a new 10 percent tax to the state’s existing 6 percent sales tax. That’s low compared to other states where pot is commercialized. The ballot initiative would legalize possession of up to 2.5 ounces of pot, and safety storing four times that amount, according to the Detroit Free Press. It would also legalize growing up to 12 pot plants in the home. As in North Dakota, anecdotal evidence suggests voters could be animated by the issue in Michigan, where 61 percent of voters support legalization for recreational use, according to a Michigan State University survey. But few Democrats in competitive races there have capitalized on the issue. For example, Republican Rep. Mike Bishop faces a challenge from former Obama administration official Elissa Slotkin in a race Inside Elections rates a Toss-up. But Slotkin has stopped short of endorsing recreational marijuana outright, instead saying that “voters should have their voices heard” and expressing support for medical marijuana. Missouri and Utah will also take up ballot initiative on decriminalizing marijuana, but only for patients with certain medical conditions and a prescription. Medical marijuana attracts a greater degree of support from Republicans, Brookings said, so any electoral impact in those states would be more muted.
